Abstract
Background: Recent genome-wide microarray-based research investigations have revealed a high frequency of
submicroscopic copy number alterations (CNAs) in the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), suggesting microarray-
based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has the potential to detect new clinically relevant genomic
markers in a diagnostic laboratory.
Results: We performed an exploratory study on 30 cases of MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) or evolving
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (% bone marrow blasts ≤ 30%, range 0-30%, median, 8%) by aCGH, using a
genome-wide bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarray. The sample data were compared to corresponding
cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and clinical-pathological findings. Previously unidentified
imbalances, in particular those considered submicroscopic aberrations (< 10 Mb), were confirmed by FISH analysis.
CNAs identified by aCGH were concordant with the cytogenetic/FISH results in 25/30 (83%) of the samples tested.
aCGH revealed new CNAs in 14/30 (47%) patients, including 28 submicroscopic or hidden aberrations verified by
FISH studies. Cryptic 344-kb RUNX1 deletions were found in three patients at time of AML transformation. Other
hidden CNAs involved 3q26.2/EVI1, 5q22/APC, 5q32/TCERG1,12p13.1/EMP1, 12q21.3/KITLG, and 17q11.2/NF1. Gains
of CCND2/12p13.32 were detected in two patients. aCGH failed to detect a balanced translocation (n = 1) and low-
level clonality (n = 4) in five karyotypically aberrant samples, revealing clinically important assay limitations.
Conclusions: The detection of previously known and unknown genomic alterations suggests that aCGH has
considerable promise for identification of both recurring microscopic and submicroscopic genomic imbalances that
contribute to myeloid disease pathogenesis and progression. These findings suggest that development of higher-
resolution microarray platforms could improve karyotyping in clinical practice.
Introduction
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) comprise a het-
erogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic cell disorders
characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a highly
variable clinical course, ranging from indolence over
many years to rapid progression to acute myeloid leuke-
mia (AML). MDS is also closely related to the World
Health Organization (WHO) classification entities of
MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN) and AML with
myelodysplasia-related changes [1]. Because the features
of MDS are heterogenous and the majority of MDS
patients are ≥ 60 years old [2], major research efforts
have focused on identifying new biological and prognos-
tic markers to optimize and detoxicify therapy for mye-
loid neoplasias [3-8].
The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)
was introduced in 1997 for evaluation of primary MDS
patients to predict overall survival and leukemia-free sur-
vival [9]. This “gold standard” scoring system is based on
three key prognostic factors: the number of peripheral
blood cytopenias, percentage of bone marrow blasts, and
cytogenetics. Although cytogenetics is one of the most
valuable diagnostic and prognostic indicators in MDS, a
limiting factor of the IPSS cytogenetics score is that only

50% of primary MDS patients show recurring cytogenetic
aberrations [10], underscoring the need to improve the
resolution of cytogenetic technology. Approximately 90%
of the karyotypic changes observed in MDS are unba-
lanced chromosome aberrations leading to gains or losses
in all, or part of, specific chromosomes [1], with the most
common karyotypic aberrations incorporated into the
IPSS. Recent clinical trials report MDS patients with
specific cytogenetic aberrations show improved efficacy
with targeted therapy; for example, del(5q) low- and
intermediate-risk MDS patients show high responsive-
ness to the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide
[11,12], and monosomy 7 MDS patients show high
responsiveness to demethylating agents [13,14]. With the
emergence of new targeted therapeutic alternatives, cur-
rent MDS cytogenetic investigations are focusing on the
need to increase sensitivity and resolution of karyotyping
technology to uncover novel cytogenetic defects, and to
correlate these findings with targeted biological activity,
response to therapy and clinical outcome [5-8,15].
Recent translational research studies have shown that
genome-wide microarray testing is a powerful technol-
ogy for detecting recurring, submicroscopic alterations
in genes that contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS
[6,8,16-19]. Such encouraging data suggest that higher-
resolution chromosomal microarray testing will improve
our diagnostic and prognostic potential in MDS; how-
ever, before implementation in diagnostic laboratories,
extensive evaluation of the technology (assays) must be
initiated to define clinical utility, sensitivity, reproduci-
bility and data analysis/interpretation limitations. As a
first step, we initiated an exploratory study using a gen-
ome-wide bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based
microarray to determine if known cytogenetic imbal-
ances and potentially important submicroscopic cytoge-
netic aberrations could be detected by microarray-based
comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in MDS/
MPD samples collected during routine clinical evalua-
tion. The aCGH results were compared to their corre-
sponding conventional cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH), and clinical-pathological findings.
Newly defined deletions and gains were validated by
FISH analysis.
Materials and methods
Patient Samples
Upon institutional review board approval (IRB# 07245,
04187, 95124), we queried the City of Hope cytogenetic
database to identify patients with clinical indications of
MDS, who had residual material available for study.
A total of 37 bone marrow samples from 30 patients
collected between 2005 and 2008 were eligible for study.
Follow-up studies were evaluated in five patients to eval-
uate assay reproducibility and clonal evolution of disease
detection. When available, the bone marrow aspirate
and biopsies were reviewed to confirm a diagnosis of
MDS based on the French-American-British (FAB) and
WHO classifications [20,21], bone marrow cellularity,
the peripheral blood parameters, and lineage dysplasia
(Table 1). During the pathology re-inspection of this ret-
rospective analysis, seven patients were re-classified as
MDS in transformation to AML because the bone mar-
row blast percentage was between 20-31%, exceeding
the WHO pathological diagnosis of MDS [21] but
within the FAB MDS classification [20]. Two patients
were diagnosed with MPN or MPN/AML: patient 29
was diagnosed with primary myelofibrosis, and patient
21 was diagnosed with AML arising from MPN (JAK2
mutation positive polycythemia vera) with 25% blasts.
One RAEB-2 patient (#27) showed a normal karyotype;
the remaining 29 patients showed karyotypic findings
consistent with a myeloid disorder. Patient #30 showed
a der(1;7)(q10;p10) after culturing in a medium supple-
mented with myeloid growth factors [22], quantitated by
FISH analysis as >5% in a direct preparation. The low-
level der(1;7) clone was present and stable in this patient
for five years with no pathological evidence of disease.
The aCGH results were compared to the patients’ cor-
responding clinical, cytogenetic and pathological charac-
teristics. The medical records were reviewed to confirm
the clinical diagnoses and associated demographics,
including age, sex, race, IPSS score, previous history,
treatment status, and transformation to AML.
Cytogenetics and FISH validation studies
Cytogenetic and FISH studies were performed using
standard methods. The cytogenetics results were
reviewed to confirm the karyotypic diagnosis, number of
secondary karyotypic changes, and overall karyotype
complexity. With the exception of patient #17, at least
20 mitotic cells were analyzed and the non-random
cytogenetic aberrations were described according to
ISCN 2009 [23]. Many of the aberrations observed by
conventional cytogenetics were confirmed by FISH stu-
dies for follow-up minimal residual disease (MRD) test-
ing using standard methods. Locus-specific FISH
analyses were performed to confirm the recurring hid-
den CNAs detected by aCGH. For the previously uni-
dentified imbalances or “cryptic” aberrations (≤ 10 Mb),
the probes used for FISH analysis were carefully chosen
and mapped within the genomic coordinates of the spe-
cific chromosome region showing gain or loss. In each
case, a control DNA FISH probe from the opposite
chromosome arm was included to verify the CNAs in
relation to cell ploidy. The following probes were
obtained from Abbott Molecular, Inc (Des Plaines, IL):
D5S23/D5S721 (5p15.2), EGR1 (5q31), CEP7/pZ7.5,
D7S486 (7q31), D8Z2 (CEP8), MYC (8q24.12-q24.13),

Two hundred cells were scored for interphase FISH
(I-FISH). When applicable, 3-5 metaphase cells were
reviewed for chromosomal localization of the CNAs as
previously described [24]. The FISH slides were scanned,
localized and recorded on the slide using the BioView
Duet image analyzer (BioView, Ltd., Rehovot, Israel).
Microarray analyses
DNA was isolated from frozen buffy coat specimens
using the EZ1 tissue kit and robot (Qiagen, Inc. Valen-
cia, CA) per manufacturer’s protocol. No myeloid cell
enrichment techniques were employed. After isolation,
DNA concentrations and quality were evaluated by
spectrophotometry using the NanoDrop ND-1000
(NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and by agar-
ose-gel electrophoresis. To evaluate array reproducibility,
three independently collected non-remission samples from
a single patient, two samples (right and left iliac crest)
collected from a single patient on the same day, and five
follow-up non-remission samples from different patients
were evaluated. All samples were processed using the
SignatureChipWG™ BAC microarray (v1.0.1) following
previously published methods [25]. The nucleotide
positions listed in SignatureChipWG v1.0.1 are based on
the UCSC Genome Browser’s March 2006 human refer-
ence sequence (hg18; NCBI Build 36.1). The aCGH results
were described according to ISCN 2009 [23]. Normal
(non-pathogenic) copy number variants (CNV) were not
included in the aCGH results (Database of Genomic Var-
iants, http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/).
Statistical analysis
The demographic and clinical covariates were compared
using ANOVA for continuous variables and Fisher’s
exact test for categorical responses.

Results
Characterization of study cohort
The clinical-pathological characteristics of the patients
studied are listed in Table 1. The median age was 64 years
(range 19 - 87) with 18 males and 12 females. The pathol-
ogy and cytogenetics evaluation verified that 29 of
30 patients had a myeloid malignancy and 29 patients had
one or more karyotypic aberrations commonly associated
with a myeloid disorder. All samples analyzed by aCGH
had a bone marrow blast percentage of ≤ 31% (range
0-31%, median 8%). Nine patients showed complex karyo-
types (≥ 3 clonal aberrations), 20 patients showed simple
karyotypes (one to two clonal aberrations), and one
RAEB-2 patient showed a normal karyotype. IPSS scores
were calculated for 16 patients: 12 patients had INT-2/
High scores and four patients had INT-1/Low scores.
Fourteen patients had a history of radiation or chemother-
apy exposure and were categorized with therapy-related
disease.
Validation of microarray assay reproducibility
Reproducibility of the microarray assay was determined
in two separate studies. First, DNA was extracted and
processed independently from both the left and right iliac
crest from patient #9. The aCGH profiles from both sam-
ples showed remarkable agreement with the correspond-
ing complex karyotype. I-FISH confirmed the presence of
new or hidden aberrations detected by aCGH. A follow-
up sample from this patient with active disease also con-
firmed the recurring CNAs. Secondly, three samples
collected from a single patient (#19) at different time
points were evaluated. The three samples showed varying
levels of residual disease (30%~70%) characterized by
monosomy 7 and an interstitial ~11 Mb deletion of the
long arm of chromosome 12. Monosomy 7 was evident
by conventional cytogenetics and confirmed by I-FISH,
whereas the 12q deletion uncovered by aCGH become
apparent during re-inspection of the longer chromo-
somes 12 in the patient’s karyograms. All three aCGH
studies of patient #19 showed excellent reproducibility of
the BAC microarray calls.
Comparison of cytogenetic, FISH and aCGH results
Table 2 lists the cytogenetic, FISH and aCGH results for
the first sample analyzed for all 30 patients. aCGH
detected CNAs in 25 (83%) of 30 MDS/MPN patient sam-
ples. Abnormalities were detected on all chromosomes
except chromosomes 10, 14, 16, × and Y. The range of
number of CNAs per patient was 0 to 23 (median 2.0
CNAs/patient) with losses more common than gains.
Thirteen patients showed one to two CNAs, 11 patients
showed ≥ 3 CNAs and six patients showed no pathological
CNAs (including one karyotypically normal patient).
Unexpected chromosome instability was observed in five
chromosome arms (5q, 6p, 7q, 12p, 19p) which showed
multiple or non-contiguous CNAs on the aCGH chromo-
some plots. Owing to non-contiguous gains and losses, a
total of 21 chromosome 7 deletions in 16 patients and
16 5q deletions in 12 patients were observed. The 5q dele-
tions were highly variable with eight different proximal
breakpoints and nine different distal breakpoints. Chromo-
some 12 showed 17 CNAs with a nearly equal number of
gains (n = 7) and losses (n = 9) in the short arm. Two
patients showed surprisingly complex 12p aCGH plots,
with multiple losses and gains, including FISH-confirmed
CCND2 amplification in one patient.
Excellent agreement between the conventional cytoge-
netics/FISH and aCGH results were observed in the
majority of patients, with aCGH providing more precise
breakpoint definition. aCGH confirmed and refined het-
erogeneous breakpoints in 5q (#6, #11, #13), 11q (#11,
#14), 12p (#23), and chromosome 7 (#12, #18) aberrations.
In patient #18, the breakpoints for both the p and q arms
of the small centromeric-containing fragment, revealed to
be chromosome 7 (84.5%) by I-FISH, were defined. The
5q breakpoints were modified from 5q15q31 to 5q21.3q32
in a RARS patient (#13), confirming that RPS14 was not
deleted. Other notable findings included the lack of an
MLL aberration in patient #11 with a del(11)(q13q23) and
lack of an ETV6 deletion in a t-MDS, patient #23, with a
del(12)(p11.2p13). In the latter patient, aCGH mapped the
12p deletion to 12p13.1p11.1, a finding verified by I-FISH
(58.5%) using a KRAS probe (RP11-34A16).
In addition to refining breakpoints, the increased
resolution of the array identified origin of unknown
markers, composition of “add” or additions to chromo-
somes, amplified regions, and unsuspected complex
rearrangements within a single cytogenetically defined
aberration. In t-MDS patient #2, aCGH revealed the add
(18) was a der(18)t(9;18), which changed the karyotype to
45, XY,-7,+9, der(9;18)(p10;q10). Similarly, the suspected
balanced t(2;6)(q33;p11.2) and r(11)(p15q23) aberrations
in a RAEB-2 patient (#7) were considerably more com-
plex by aCGH, which detected two small deletions within
6p (392-kb deletion at 6p22.2p22.1 and another 365-kb
deletion at 6p12.3), a 2q33.1q37.3 deletion, and a com-
plex deletion/duplication/deletion ring chromosome 11
resulting in three derivative chromosomes. However, the
sideline clone, composed of only two mitotic cells (10%)
with a small interstitial deletion of Xq24q28, was not
detected by BAC aCGH.
Likewise, aCGH revealed 23 CNAs in RAEB-2 patient
#1 and precisely defined the chromosomes 5, 7, 12, 17,
18, 19 and 20 imbalances. Furthermore, aCGH revealed
that two chromosome 5 abnormalities identified by kar-
yotyping, der(5)add(5)(p15.3)del(5)(q34) and monosomy

5, were in actuality three distinct deletions: the der(5)add
(5p) was a 5p15.31pter deletion, and a 163-kb 5q22.2/
APC deletion, confirmed by I-FISH (73%), and 61.3-Mb
deletion of 5q23.1qter also confirmed by I-FISH (69.2%),
were present. The dic(6;12) was more complex and
involved a marker chromosome resulting in a net loss of
2.6 Mb at 6p25.2. Chromosome 7 showed five discrete
non-contiguous regions of deletion by aCGH including
two short arm deletions (1.9-Mb deletion of 7p14.1 and
23.12-Mb deletion of 7p13q11.11) and three distinct 7q
deletions (1.24-Mb 7q11.22 deletion, 323-kb deletion
at 7q21.3, and 62.4-Mb deletion of 7q21.3q36.3). NCAM-
specific FISH (60%) confirmed the presence of an unsus-
pected 49.5-Mb 11q14.1-11q25 gain was a marker
chromosome. The 270-kb NF1 deletion and 186-kb 20p
deletion were also confirmed by I-FISH (33% and 50%,
respectively). Four cytogenetically detected aberrations of
the short arm of chromosome 12 [add(12)(p13), inv(12)
(p11.2p13), r(12)(p11.2q24.3), and dic(6;12)(p10;q10)]
resulted in an equally complex 12p aCGH plot of alter-
nating gains and losses from pter to cen: amplification of
CCND2/12p13.32 (7R/2G I-FISH pattern); loss of
12p12.2 (1R/2G pattern) using RP11-147E12, a probe
localized between PLCZ1 and PLEKHA5; and gain of
SOX5 within 12p12.1 (Figure 1A). Both chromosome 18
aberrations resulted in net imbalances: a 9.7-Mb
18p11.32p11.22 deletion (confirmed by I-FISH, 33%) and
a 20-Mb 18q21.32q23 deletion (FISH confirmed 48%
with the concurrent control probe localized to a marker
chromosome). Similarly, the complex and composite kar-
yotypes of patients #9, #16, and #28 showed unpredict-
able CNA patterns by aCGH, allowing for more precise
definition and mapping of imbalances in samples with
considerable chromosome instability.
Hidden CNAs were also observed in non-complex kar-
yotypes (#18, #24, #29). In addition to the 11-Mb deletion
of 12q reported in reproducibility study patient #18,
an 87-year-old female patient (#24) with “isolated
5q-syndrome”, quantified by I-FISH (65.5%), showed an
evolving 7.6-Mb deletion of 12p13.1p12.2 by aCGH, con-
firmed by I-FISH (17%) using the RP11-1069E18/EMP1
probe. A primary myelofibrosis patient (#29) showed a
non-complex der(1;7) karyotype; however, aCGH revealed
four additional submicroscopic deletions (% of cells show-
ing the deletion by I-FISH in parentheses): a ~300-kb
5q32/TCERG1 deletion (77%); a 380-kb 12p13.1 deletion
(~10%); a 1.65-Mb deletion at 13q14.2q14.3 (91%) using a
probe for RB1; and a 835-kb NF1/17q11.2 deletion (75%).
Three other MDS patients with non-complex karyo-
types showed submicroscopic 344-kb RUNX1 deletions
at AML transformation. Trisomy 8 patient #21 (82.5%
by I-FISH) showed two accompanying submicroscopic
aberrations by aCGH, a duplication of 1p21.3p12 con-
firmed by I-FISH (32%) and loss of RUNX1 at 21q22.12
confirmed by triple-color I-FISH (~10%) using a small
180-kb RUNX1 probe (dJ1107L6) in trisomy 8 positive
cells (Figure 1B). I-FISH using a 500-kb commercially
available probe for RUNX1 failed to detect the 344-kb
deletion, emphasizing the power of aCGH technology to
detect clinically significant submicroscopic abnormalities
and the need to use an appropriately sized FISH probe
to confirm the smaller submicroscopic CNAs. The sec-
ond trisomy 8, in patient #26, which was quantified at
22.5% by I-FISH, also showed a suspected RUNX1 dele-
tion at AML transformation. I-FISH using the RP11-
77G18 FISH probe that only covered 120 kb of RUNX1
was found to be within background with no additional
material remaining to repeat the test using a RUNX1-
specific FISH probe. The third patient was a confirmed
del(7q) positive t-MDS patient (#22) being evaluated
post-treatment for breast cancer. Surprisingly, microar-
ray analysis showed the del(7q) carried an hidden

unbalanced der(7)t(3;7) rearrangement with 7q loss and
gain of 3q with an EVI1 breakpoint confirmed by FISH
(~90%) using two BACs that flank the EVI1 gene at
3q26.2 (Figure 2A). In addition, this patient also showed
a “cryptic” RUNX1 deletion (data not shown).
A fibrotic RAEB-1 patient (#15) who failed treatment
with lenalidomide and received AZT therapy for 10 years
showed a hypodiploid (complex) karyotype with six clo-
nal aberrations. aCGH confirmed the known imbalances,
revised multiple breakpoints, revealed small deletions at
translocation breakpoint sites, and exposed two compli-
cated rearrangements involving chromosomes 7 and 12.
Non-contiguous chromosome 7 resulted in four distinct
deletions (one in 7p and three in 7q) (Figure 2B) and as
the 7 centromere and band 7q31 were retained, FISH
using a commercially available 7cen/7q31 FISH probe set
showed a false normal signal pattern. Moreover, the
FISH-confirmed dup/del/dup CNAs in 12p were not visi-
ble by cytogenetics (Figure 2C). In contrast, loss of
CDKN2A, detected by I-FISH (44.5%) only, was not
detected by aCGH because probes for 9p21 and this spe-
cific gene were not well represented on the BAC array.
The presence of both hypodiploid and hypotetraploid
clones in a background of normal cells in two patients
(#3 and #16) resulted in a variable log2 ratio, confounding
data interpretation. Despite the presence of low-level 2n/
4n abnormal (three mitotic cells each) clonality in a back-
ground of 70% normal cells, the aCGH profile for RCUD
patient #3 showed a clear 4.6-Mb deletion at 5q32q33.1,
including a hemizygous deletion of RPS14; however, loss

pattern; deletion at 12p12.3 (1R/2G pattern) confirmed using the RP11-147E12 FISH probe which maps between PLCZ1 and PLEKHA5; and gain

(duplication) of 1p21.3p12 confirmed by FISH (32%), and the bottom chromosome 21 plot shows a 344-kb RUNX1/21q22.12 deletion. The
duplication was confirmed by FISH on metaphase cells using a 1p21 probe (RP11-96F24), which maps within the duplicated segment, labeled in
red, and a control probe that maps to 1q24 (RP11-104L21) labeled in green. Arrow indicates tandem 1p duplication in the metaphase cell. The
interphase cell shows three red signals and two green signals. Triple-color interphase FISH (lower right) confirms RUNX1 deletion in 10% of
trisomy 8-positive cells. The chromosome 8 centromere probe is labeled in aqua (signals not arrowed), a control probe for distal 21q is labeled
in green (white arrows), and the 180-kb RUN1 probe (dJ1107L6) is labeled in red. RUNX1 deletion was present in 10% of trisomy 8-posiitve cells.

of the Y chromosome was not detected because sex chro-
mosome alterations are not obvious using sex-mis-
matched control DNA and BAC microarrays. Neither
aCGH nor FISH analysis detected the 17p deletion. FISH
quantitation of 17p deletion was 2% (within background)
owing to the low frequency of the near-2n clone (~15%)
and a false “normal” FISH pattern in the corresponding
4n clone. Conversely, the near-4n clone in patient #16,
estimated at ~10%, showed concordance between the
aCGH and cytogenetics results, with two exceptions:
chromosome 19 showed greater complexity by aCGH,
whereas loss of the Y chromosome was only detected by
cytogenetics. Follow-up studies for both patients con-
firmed the genetic results for both patients.
Clonal evolution of disease was evaluated by aCGH in
three patients (#9, #15, and #16). The follow-up samples
were compared to their earlier (reference) sample. All
three patients showed an increase in blast count with
evolution of their complex karyotypes. Clonal evolution
was evident by aCGH by the presence of new

Limitations of aCGH in a diagnostic setting
Five karyotypically aberrant patients showed normal
aCGH results. Patient #5 showed a balanced t(3;12)(p25;
q13), and four patients (#4, #10, #25 and #30) showed
low-level clonality (>10~15%). Patient #10 received a
matched unrelated stem cell transplant for karyotypically
normal RAEB in 1996 but relapsed in 2007. The small
del(20q) population observed in this patient was within
background limits by I-FISH (~2%) and was suspected
to be donor-derived based on chimerism studies. The
only deletion noted in patient #30 was a 458-kb deletion
at 3p12.1 thought to be a CNA of no known pathologi-
cal significance. This patient had shown low-level der
(1;7) clonality, confirmed by I-FISH in ~3-5%, for five
years without pathological evidence of disease. Patient
#4 showed a del(5q) karyotype, but I-FISH (0.7%) did
not confirm a del(5q) in the residual material above
background. The sample submitted for patient #25 was
aparticulate and hemodilute with only 5% involvement
by I-FISH.
The BAC aCGH results detected low-level trisomy
9/del(20q) clonality in a patient with high-grade MDS
(RAEB-2 patient #17), quantitated at ~16% involvement
by I-FISH, but we found the results were not always
reproducible under 20% involvement. In patient #20, the
MDS-related del(5q) clone was easily detected by cyto-
genetics, non-targeted FISH and aCGH; however, this
patient also had low-level involvement of hyperdiploid
multiple myeloma. The hyperdiploid clone was only
detected by plasma cell-specific FISH studies [26], indi-
cating that low-level clonality observed in co-morbid
disease states may be masked by the dominant clone,
requiring enrichment steps for detection by aCGH.
Discussion
We undertook this exploratory study to determine if a
genome-wide BAC microarray would enhance karyotype
precision in MDS/MPN by detecting previously known
and clinically relevant submicroscopic CNAs. We also
sought to define limitations of array-based karyotyping
that might require further evaluation and refinement
prior to implementation in the clinical diagnostic set-
ting. These objectives were accomplished by comparing
the aCGH results to their corresponding cytogenetics
and clinicopathological features. In addition, all new
submicroscopic CNAs were verified by FISH analysis.
Independent confirmation of unexpected CNAs found
by aCGH, using techniques like FISH, multiplex liga-
tion-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) or other molecular techniques,
including other higher- or lower-resolution microarrays,
is critical in a diagnostic laboratory to confirm array
results.
Consistent with prior array-based investigations
[6,8,27], a number of advantages and challenges for clin-
ical aCGH studies in MDS are evident. Overall, conven-
tional cytogenetics and aCGH show excellent agreement
for the commonly observed imbalances found in MDS
patients with the added advantage to aCGH of providing
more precise details of the alterations including genomic
size, gene content and finely mapped breakpoints. As
reported by others [8,17,28], the proximal and distal 5q
breakpoints were found to be highly variable. Three del
(5q) patients presented here illustrate the potential clini-
cal utility of this added information.
Deletions of 5q are observed in ~10-15% of de novo
MDS patients; however, only a small subset fulfill the
WHO criteria for “isolated del(5q)” syndrome, a hap-
loinsufficiency disorder of the ribosomal protein RPS14
gene associated with low blast counts, a good prognosis
and a favorable response to lenalidomide [11,29-31].
The sole del(5q) alteration reported in RARS patient
#13 did not include the RPS14 gene and in confirma-
tion, this patient had failed to achieve a response with
lenalidomide. Another MDS patient (#24) with “isolated
5q” syndrome showed an emerging submicroscopic sec-
ondary alteration. Submicroscopic CNAs have been
reported in other “isolated 5q-” patients [17,18]; how-
ever, the clinical implications and substratification of
added molecular genetics events in these patients are
unknown. Nevertheless, the presence of one or more
karyotypic aberrations in del(5q) MDS has been asso-
ciated with significantly shortened overall survival
[12,32], suggesting a clinical necessity to monitor the
frequency of secondary alterations during treatment.
Thirdly, selection of an appropriate FISH probe for
monitoring MRD is easily achieved based on aCGH
results. For example, the presence of a secondary del(11)
(q13q23) aberration in del(5q)-positive patient #11
implied a quantitative MLL/11q23 FISH assessment
might have been useful to monitor clone size during
treatment; however, FISH studies indicated the MLL
gene was neither deleted nor rearranged. Similarly,
ETV6 hemizygous deletions are commonly reported in
myeloid disorders; however, the del(12p) in patient #23
did not result in an ETV6 deletion but did result in loss
of KRAS. Andreasson and colleagues [33] were the first
to report that 12p deletions in myeloid disorders do not
always involve ETV6, and deletions in this region may
occur without visible karyotypic changes, as seen in
patient #15. These co-authors further suggest deletion
of CDKN1B, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, or a
nearby gene may play a critical role in myeloid malig-
nancies. Selecting a suitable FISH probe from within the

aCGH-defined deletion provides a testable clonal marker
for a quick quantitative assessment of the subclone at
presentation and for MRD testing in follow-up samples,
improves laboratory resource utilization and spares the
patient the cost of non-informative FISH testing.
In agreement with other MDS investigations using var-
ious microarray platforms [6,8,18,19,28], 47% of the MDS
samples studied showed hidden CNAs by aCGH. Submi-
croscopic CNAs were found in both complex and non-
complex karyotypes revealing the composition of mar-
kers, authenticating questionable calls and improving
definition of the imbalances. Hidden complexity fre-
quently involved 5q, 6p, 7q, 12p, and 19p with unsus-
pected gene amplification exposed in two RAEB-2
patients who quickly progressed to AML. Amplification
of CCND2 at 12p13.32 in patient #1 implies disruption
of cell cycle progression and loss of hematopoietic regu-
lation [34], whereas amplification of the 19p13.3p13.2
region in patient #16, a 2-Mb region housing many
genes, requires further studies to characterize the altera-
tion. The heterogeneity and high degree of chromosome
instability observed among the various subtypes of MDS/
MPN denotes considerable genomic complexity and
underscores the need for a well-designed high-density
genome-wide microarray for clinical diagnostics.
The clinical outcome of der(1;7) MDS patients has
been a subject of much debate [35,36]. Our study
included three patients (#8, #29, #30) with der(1;7)(q10;
p10) as the sole aberration based on cytogenetic analysis.
Patient 29 presented with marked anemia, thrombocyto-
penia with dysplastic megakaryocytes and der(1;7)(q10;
p10) in 95% of the metaphase cells analyzed. aCGH
detected four additional submicroscopic deletions in this
patient ranging in size from 310 kb to 1.65 Mb: 5q32/
TCERG1, 12p13.1/EMP1, 13q14.2q14.3/RB1, and
17q11.2/NF1. Our aCGH analysis revealed hidden dele-
tions in the RAS regulator NF1 tumor-suppressor gene
in two patients. In addition, RAS pathway mutations with
and without RUNX1 alterations have been reported in
-7/7q- alterations in AML arising from MDS and chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia with myelodysplastic features
[37-39]. Clinical trials designed to evaluate the ability of
RAS inhibitors in MDS have shown limited success, hint-
ing that further patient stratification may be needed to
develop RAS inhibitors and mTOR-directed therapeutics
[40]. The second der(1;7) patient (#8), classified as
RCMD with a history of aplastic anemia, showed a suspi-
cious 13q deletion by aCGH, as an evolving secondary
alteration. The third patient (#30) showed low-level der
(1;7) clonality for five years with no pathological evidence
of disease and a normal aCGH result. These data suggest
the presence of submicroscopic CNAs in der(1;7)-posi-
tive patients may explain the morphologic and clinical
heterogeneity observed in myeloid disorders harboring
this specific chromosome aberration.
MDS patients face a ~25% risk that the disease will
transform into AML. Cooperating genetic events between
two mutation classes appear to play a role in leukemogen-
esis, namely, inactivation of a hematopoietic transcription
factor resulting in loss of cellular differentiation, along
with activation of the tyrosine kinase RAS-BRAF signal
transduction pathway to stimulate cell cycling and prolif-
eration [37]. In support of this hypothesis, cryptic CNAs
were detected in three high-risk MDS patients with non-
complex studies at AML transformation. Two isolated
trisomy 8 cases (#21, #26) in this study showed a ~340-kb
deletion of RUNX1 corroborating the findings of cryptic
aberrations in four of 10 trisomy 8 MDS patients reported
by Paulsson and co-authors [16]. The third patient (#22),
with a submicroscopic deletion of RUNX1, showed a hid-
den unbalanced EVI1/3q26.2 translocation masked as a 7q
deletion, which leads to EVI1 overexpression [41]. Because
RUNX1 and EVI1 mutations are frequently reported in
high-grade MDS at transformation to AML [37], and EVI1
overexpression is a poor prognostic and risk stratification
marker in AML [41,42], we agree with Gondek and collea-
gues [5,6] that aCGH will improve patient management
and prognostication in MDS.
Balanced rearrangements cannot be detected by
aCGH. The frequency of balanced translocations in
MDS is estimated to be less than 10% with most trans-
locations involving MLL, EVI1 and DEK/NUP214 [21],
which suggests that conventional cytogenetics and
aCGH are complementary assays in the clinical workup
of the myeloid disorders. However, a recent modification
of aCGH known as translocation-CGH may provide a
new approach to detect prognostically important
balanced translocations in neoplastic disorders in the
near future [43].
A second limitation of aCGH in diagnostic settings is
the inability to detect imbalances reproducibly when the
tumor burden is below 20% [5,6,44]. Problems detecting
low-level clonality were observed in four different clini-
cal situations: 1) a normal aCGH result in a patient with
a karyotypic-aberrant clone in the absence of morpholo-
gic disease; 2) low-level clonality in low-grade MDS, in
particular with del(20q) or loss/rearrangement of a sex
chromosome; 3) detection of the dominant clone only
in a co-morbid patient; and 4) difficulty interpreting
emerging subclones associated with clonal evolution of
disease. Co-morbidity and loss of the Y chromosome
occur most frequently in older patients. Whereas low-
level loss of the Y chromosome is typically considered
an age-related phenomenon without pathological conse-
quences, other sex chromosome aberrations in MDS,
such as the idic(Xq), are important to report.

The detection of emerging clones by aCGH for eva-
luation of clonal evolution of disease was also challen-
ging. Because MDS samples are heterogeneous with
multiple cell types and varying degrees of cellular differ-
entiation, enrichment techniques using highly purified
CD34+ positive progenitor cells may result in improved
microarray resolution Moreover, aCGH should not be
used as an MRD assay, however, the detection of patho-
genetic CNAs at presentation allows for disease-specific
FISH and PCR MDR assays at follow-up.
Two additional factors complicating data interpretation
were variability of the log2 ratio in samples with multiple
clones, especially cases with 2n and 4n clones, and distin-
guishing true pathogenetic genomic alterations from
benign CNAs. In the first instance, interpreting aCGH
results became unclear when the frequency of one of the
2n/4n subclones rose above 10%. In this situation, FISH
results are also misleading because a monosomy in a
near-diploid clone will show a “false normal” signal pat-
tern in the 4n clone. Lastly, ~40 benign CNAs were
observed in this study, with most found within segmental
duplications. Defining true tumor-associated genomic
alterations from non-pathogenetic CNAs requires experi-
ence, access to large public databases of normal variants,
and perhaps in some neoplastic disorders, comparison of
normal and tumor tissue in the same patient.
Our exploratory results using a genome-wide BAC
microarray provide preliminary evidence that chromoso-
mal microarray testing holds great promise for augment-
ing conventional cytogenetics in MDS/MPN. These
results also underscore the importance of continued
efforts to improve DNA microarray technology in oncol-
ogy practice. Because this was a proof-of-principle study,
our BAC platform did not have proper coverage of the
hematopoietic transcription factors and genes associated
with the RAS-BRAF signal transcription pathway; in par-
ticular, poor probe coverage at 9p21 resulted in a missed
CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion. To facilitate the implemen-
tation of clinically relevant genomic information in
MDS/MPD, a genome-wide, high-resolution microarray
targeting disease-relevant candidate genes, e.g., TET2,
IER3, TIRAP, CBL and ASXL1 [18,45-48] and regions of
known chromosome instability is recommended. The
decision to use an oligonucleotide-based, SNP-based or
an oligonucleotide/SNP hybrid platform must be evalu-
ated for test accuracy, validity and clinical relevance
within a clinical trial setting.
