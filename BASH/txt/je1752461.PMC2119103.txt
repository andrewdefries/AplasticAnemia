Summary
The major target organ for hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the liver. However, cellsother than hepatocytes,
including peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes, may become infected with HBV. The
cell receptor binding site was assigned to the preS(21-47) segment of the HBV envelope protein.
HBV receptors were detected on human liver and hepatoma cells, on B lymphocytes, and, as
shown here, on monocytes, and T cell lines, activated by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and
concanavalin A, respectively. The cell receptors for HBV have not been characterized until now.
The detection of HBV receptors and their "activation antigen" characteristic on distinct cells
suggested paths for identification of the receptors with already defined cell surface proteins. This
search revealed that interleukin 6 contains recognition sites for the preS(21-47) sequence and
mediates HBV-cell interactions. Thus, HBV belongs to a group of viruses utilizing cytokines
or cytokine receptors for replication and interference with the host immune system.
H
epatitis B virus (HBV),1 a member of the family of
hepadnaviridae (1), is a major human pathogen impli-
cated in primary hepatocarcinoma. Its major target organ is
the liver but cells other than hepatocytes, including PBL, may
become infected (2). The HBV envelope (env) consists of three
distinct related proteins, designated S, M, and L protein, which
are products of a single env gene. These proteins share a
common 226 COOH-terminal amino acid sequence (S pro-
tein). M protein has an additional 55 amino acid sequence
located at the NH2 terminus (preS2 sequence). L protein
differs from M protein by an additional NH2-terminal 108
or 119amino acid sequence designated as preS1. The site medi-
ating the attachment of HBV to human hepatoma HepG2
cells (3-5) and to human liver plasma membranes (6, 7) en-
compasses amino acid residues (21-47) of the preS1 sequence.
The presence of receptors for the preS (21-47) region of
the HBV env protein was demonstrated also on cells of non-
hepatic origin, including PBL, hematopoietic cell lines of the
B cell lineage, and some carcinoma and simian virus 40 (SV-
40)-transformed cell lines (2). HBV DNA or RNA was de-
tected not only in B lymphocytes but also in T lymphocytes
(8) and in PBMC (9) of HBV-infected humans and chim-
panzees. However, preSl-specific cell receptors for HBV were
not detected on T cells, PBMC, or promonocytic cell lines

(2; seebelow). Toresolve this apparent discrepancy,we searched
for the expression of HBV receptors in cell lines of the latter
two lineages after activation with lectins and LPS, respec-
tively. The emergence of HBV receptors could indeed be
demonstrated after activation of the cells. The constitutive
expression of HBV receptors in several cell lines and their
induced expression in the additional lines facilitated the de-
sign of strategies to define the receptors. The quest to char-
acterize preSl-specificreceptors for HBV led to the identifica-
tion of II:6 as a cell attachment site for HBV. Thus, HBV
appears to belong to a group of viruses utilizing interactions
between vitally encoded proteins and cytokines or cytokine
receptors as steps in replication (10-16).

Dr. M. G. Low (Columbia University, New York, NY) or was
purchasedfrom Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals(Indianapolis,
IN). These treatments did not affect cell viability as determined
by trypan blue exclusion tests.
SelectedT celllines,PBMC, and the promonocyticcelllineU937
were stimulated by adding to the appropriate tissue culture media
Con A (50 ~g/ml; SigmaChemical Co., St. Louis,MO) and Esch-
erickiacoliLPS(5/~g/ml; catalogno. 055:B5;SigmaChemicalCo.),
respectively,for time periods indicated in Results.
PreS(12-47)-and preS(12-32)-celluloseand cellulosewith cova-
lently linked serum-derived hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
containing the preS1 sequence were all prepared as described be-
fore (2, 3). Magnetic beads with attached mAb to CD antigens
and cytokinereceptors,respectively,werepreparedasfollows.Mag-
neticbeadswith covalentlyattached goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM
and anti-rat IgG, respectively(depending on the mAb used) (300

50/~g of the respectivemAb overnight at 4~ Unadsorbed anti-
bodieswereremoved,the beadswerewashedfour timeswith 0.14M
NaC1, 0.01 M phosphate, 0.02% NAN3,pH 7 (PBS), and resus-
pended in 300 #1of TS. mAb to CD antigens were obtained from
Amac,Inc.(Westbrook, ME) or from donorslistedin Acknowledg-
ments. Antibodies to IL-2R/3 chain were obtained from Endogen
(Boston, MA). Monoclonaland polyclonalrabbit antibodiesto Ib6
were obtained from Genzyme(Cambridge, MA). The rabbit anti-
IL-6corresponded to an IgG prepared from serum by ammonium
sulfateprecipitation. 1mg ofthe partiallypurifiedIgG wasreported
by the manufacturer to neutralize 100 ng of Ib6 after prolonged
incubation.
The attachment of cells to the cellulose derivativewas quanti-
ratedasdescribedbefore (2, 3). The SD ofrelativecellcounts, each
based on 14 OD determinations, was g + 8% (2). To detect the
attachment of cellsto mAb-coated magnetic beads, 50/~1ofbeads
('~5 x 10s particles/ml) was mixed with 5 x 10s cells in 0.5 ml
of TS containing 1 mM CaC12 and 10 mg/ml of BSA (TS-Ca-
BSA). After mixing for 30 rain at 20~ attached and unattached
cellswere separatedmagneticallyand quantitated bymeasuring lac-
tate dehydrogenase activity as described before (2, 3).
The inhibitory effect of mAbs, of polyclonal rabbit antiserum

and the respectiveimmobilized ligandswas followedby adding the
respectivesubstancesto the ceU-ligandmixtures otherwisefollowing
conditions to study the attachment of cells to the respectiveim-
mobilized ligands. The final concentrations of the respective in-
hibitors arepresentedin Results. In addition to antisera and mAbs,
the following cytokines were studied for inhibitory activity: IL-3
and IL-6produced in CHO cells (both from Genetics Institute,
Cambridge, MA); Ib7 (Sterling Drug, Inc., Malvern, PA); IL-5
(from E. coli), leukemic inhibitory factor, and TGF-cxand "B (all
four from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, California). CHO cell- and
yeast-derivedI1.,6was also obtained from Genzyme, and E. coli-
derived Ib6 from tk & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).
Measurement of Association betweenIL.6 and the preS1 Region of
the HBV env Protein. The associationbetween IL-6and the pep-
tide preS(21-47)was measuredby affinitychromatography.PreS(21-
47)-cellulose(1.6 mg of the cellulose derivative in a finalvolume
of 100/zl TS-Ca-BSA)was mixed with 500 ng of IL-6.After incu-
bation for 1 h at 20~ the cellulosederivativewas pelletedby cen-
trifugation, transferred to a minicolumn, and eluted with 4 M
MgC12at 20~ II.-6was determined in the original preparation
and the wash and eluate by ELISA after diluting the specimens
1,000-fold.The ELISAkit to quantify Ib6 (Intertest 6X) was ob-
tained from Genzyme. The kit usesyeast Ib6 as a calibration stan-
dard and detects IL-6from mammalian cells with a lower senti-
tivity (•1/15) as compared with E. colior yeastIb6 (own data).
Control experiments were carried out with preS(12-32)-ceUulose.
The respectivecellulosederivativescontained 5-10 mg of peptides
per gram of cellulose.
The formation of complexes between HBsAg containing the
preS1sequenceand Ib6 was detectedby a sandwichELISAutilizing
wellscoated with anti-preS1mAb F35.25 (1/~g per well; reference
5) or with goat antibodiesto Sprotein (obtainedaspart ofan ELISA
kit fromNuclearMedicalLaboratories,Irving, TX), andbiotinyated
polyclonal rabbit anti-IL-6. Graded quantities of distinct HBsAg
preparations were incubated with II.-6in the diluent used for the
Intertest 6X kit for 30 min at 25~ followed by 90 min at 4~
Subsequently, the mixtures were transferred to wells coated with
the respective(anti-Sor anti-preS1)antibodies. After overnight in-
cubation, the quantity of attached Ib-6 was determined using re-
agents from the Intertest 6X kit. The following preparations of
HBsAg were utilized in these tests: L protein produced in yeast
(18);recombinant HBsAg (produced in CHO cells)either lacking
(19)or expressingthe preS1sequence(',~10ng ofthe preS1sequence
per/~g ofHBsAg;Bio-TechnologyGeneral,Rehovot, Israel);serum-
derived HBsAg (containing 50 ng of the preS1 sequence per/~g
of HBsAg; reference3), and recombinant HBsAg consisting of S
protein produced in yeast (20).
Ultrafiltration was used to demonstrate directly the association
between HBsAg and IL-6 and to determine the equilibrium be-
tween bound and unbound II.-6. Distinct quantities of HBsAg
preparations and of recombinant L protein listed above (10 ng to
I l~g)were mixed with I1_,6(5-89ng in 1 ml of TS-Ca containing
1 mg/ml of BSA and 0.25 mg/ml of gelatine prefiltered through
a 0.22-# filter). After incubation for 2 h at 20~ the mixtures
were transferredinto Ultrafree-CL filters(Millipore,Bedford,MA)
and centrifuged at 2,000 revolutions/min. The filtrates were as-
sayedfor IL-6by ELISAafter appropriate dilution. Based on pre-
liminary experiments, filters with a cut-off of 3 x 102kD were
selected,sinceunbound Ib6 was not retainedby these filters,while
both HBsAg and L protein, existing predominantly in the form
of aggregates (18),were retained by the ultrafiltration membranes
of this porosity. The experiments were carried out with rlL-6pro-
duced in CHO cells (Genetics Institute). Similarresults were ob-
tained with Ib6 produced in yeast and E. coli, respectively.
Results
Induction of HBV Receptors in Cells That Do Not Constitu-
tively Express the Receptors. HBV DNA and ILNA were de-
tected in peripheral B cells, T calls, and monocytes (8, 9).
On the other hand, HBV receptors were detected only on
cells belonging to the B cell lineage (2). To resolve this ap-
parent discrepancy, we wished to determine whether or not
the expression of HBV receptors can be induced in T cell
lines. HUT-78 and MOLT-3 cells stimulated with Con A at-
tached to a peptide from the preS1 sequence of the HBV env
protein (preS[21-47]) covalently attached to cellulose, indi-
cating the presence of HBV receptors on these cells (Fig. 1).
Expression of the receptors appeared to be maximal after ac-
tivation for 24 h and gradually declined after prolonged in-

cubation with Con A. HUT-78 and MOLT-3 cells not ex-
posed to Con A failed to attach to the cellulose derivative,
indicating the absence of HBV receptors on nonstimulated
cells. On the other hand, H9 cells, related to the prototype
HUT-78 cell line (21), expressed HBV receptors constitutively.
The expression of HBV receptors was also induced by Con A
in Jurkat cells (66% attachment to preS[21-47]-celIulose) but
not in the T cell lines CEM, MOLT-4, and MT-4 (<10%
attachment; data not shown). Cells that attached to preS(21-
47)-cellulose also attached to HBsAg containing the preS1
sequence covalently linked to cellulose (HBs-cellulose). How-
ever, they did not attach to another peptide from the preS1
sequence, preS(12-32) linked to cellulose. Attempts to induce
the expression of HBV receptors on the majority of T cells
from PBL by Con A were unsuccessful (data not shown).
Results of experiments to be described later indicated that
recognition sites for the HBV env protein were also induc-
ible by LPS in PBMC and a promonocytic cell line, U937
(see Fig. 8).
Treatmentof Cells with PI-PLC Diminishes the SurfaceEx-
posure of Recognition Sitesfor the HBV env preS(21-47) Se-
quence. A subset of cell surface proteins are anchored to the
membrane by covalent linkage to an oligosaccharide which
is glycosidicaUy linked to PI. They can be released from cells
by PI-PI.C (22, 23). Severalleucocytecell differentiation (CD)
antigens, including activation antigens, are PI anchored (24).
Since HBV receptors are expressed or inducible on several
lineages of hemopoietic ceils in addition to hepatoma and
liver cells, it was of interest to determine whether or not treat-
ment with PI-PLC renders these cells nonreactive with the
preS(21-47) ligand. Susceptibility to cleavage by PI-PLC, if
demonstrable, was expected to facilitate the characterization
of HBV receptors and their possible identification with al-
ready characterized cell surface proteins. The percentage of
HepG2 cells attaching to (21-47)- or HBs-cellulose decreased
to background levels after treatment with PI-PLC (Fig. 2).
Receptors for HBV becamegraduallyreexpressedon the treated
cells after subsequent cultivation in tissue culture media. Treat-
ment with PI-PLC resulted in decreased attachment to preS1
ligands of most other cell lines tested. However, RPMI 8226
myeloma cells, H9, and Con A-activated MOLT-3 and HUT-
78 T cell lines treated with PI-PLC continued to adsorb to
the cellulose derivatives. A cell-specific heterogeneity in sen-
sitivity of PI-anchored membrane antigens to release by PI-
PLC was noted before (23) and may explain the observed ex-
ceptions. A decrease in the ability of PI-PLC to remove PI-
anchored surface proteins from activated T cells was also
reported (25). These results suggest that similar binding sites
for the preS1 region of the HBV env protein are attached
to the cell membranes of most, if not all cells tested, through
a PI anchor.

toma cellsand liver cell membranes (3-7), were also detected
on PBL B cells and on activated T cell lines and PBMC, it
seemed possible that a CD antigen might also function as
an HBV receptor. This possibility appeared attractive, since
some CD antigenswere identifiedasreceptorsfor other viruses
(CD4, CD21, and CD54; 26-29). Therefore, the expression
of CD antigens on HepG2 cellswas studied. Becauseof the
expression of HBV receptors on several hemopoietic cell
lineages, the studies were limited to those CD antigens that
are not considered specific markers to distinguish one cell
lineage from another. Platelets and RBCs did not react with
preS1ligands. Therefore, CD antigens expressedon the latter
two celltypeswerenot searchedfor their expressionon HepG2
cells. Among the 33 CD antigens searched for, only fiveap-
peared to be expressed on the surface of HepG2 cells abun-
dantly enough to mediate the attachment of these cells to
magnetic beads coated with the respective anti-CD mAbs
(Fig. 3). These antigens were: CD58 (LFA-3),CD59, CD69,
CD71 (transferrinreceptor), and CD73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase).
Three of these antigens (CD58, CD59, and CD73) arelinked
to the cellmembraneby aPI anchor and two antigens (CD69
and CD71) are defined as activation markers (24). Another
activation antigen, 4F2 (30), was alsopresent on the surface
of HepG2 cells.
After establishing the surfaceexpression of severalCD an-
tigens on HepG2 cells, experiments were carried out to de-
termine whether or not any of these antigens recognized the
preS(21-47) site on the HBV env protein. First, it was deter-
mined whether or not anyof the mAbs directed against each
of the six antigens referred to abovewould inhibit the at-
tachment of HepG2 cellsto preS(21-47)- and HBs-cellulose,
respectively.Second, the effectofpolyclonalrabbit antibodies
to the HBV receptor (3) on the attachment of HepG2 cells
to magnetic beads coated with mAbs against the respective
CD antigens and 4F2 was investigated. In no casewere there
any inhibitory effectsobserved, suggesting that none of these
CD/activation antigens functionedas receptors for the preS1
region of the HBV env protein.
InhibitoryEffect oflL6 on theAttachment of CellsExpressing
theHBV Receptorto(21-47)-andHBs-Cellulose. After exclud-
ing all CD antigens tested as candidate HBV receptors, the
possibility was considered that cytokine receptors might be
involved in the interaction between the preS1 region of
the HBV env protein and cells. To address this possibility,
the inhibitory effect of severalcytokines on the reaction be-
tween HepG2 cellsand preSl-specificligands was examined.
In complementary experiments, the expression of some cy-
tokinereceptorson HepG2 cellswasassayedusing experimental
procedures analogous to those for detection of the expres-
sion of CD antigens (Fig. 3).
I1.3, IL-5, 11-7, TGF-ot and -~, and leukemic inhibitory
factor, all at concentrations of 5-20/zg/ml, did not inhibit
the attachment of HepG2 cellsto preS(21-47)cellulose. The
IL-2R c~chain (CD 25; Fig. 3) and II.-2R ~ chain (data not
shown) were not detectable on HepG2 cells. On the other
hand, I1.6Rs were expressed on HepG2 cells, as detected by
both cytofluorometryand by attachment of these cellsto anti-
I1.6tL-coatedbeads (data not shown), in agreementwith al-
ready published data (31). The inhibitory effect of I1.-6on
the interaction betweenHepG2 cellsand preS(21-47)-cellulose
was investigatedoriginallyto determine whether or not I1.6R
blockadewould interferewith cellattachment. Results shown
in Fig. 4 indicate that I1.6 indeed inhibited the attachment
of HepG2 cells to preS(21-47)-cellulosein a dose-dependent
fashion. This inhibitory effect was abrogated by anti-IL-6
mAbs. The attachment of HepG2 cells to HBsAg-cellulose
was alsoinhibited by Ib6 at similar concentrations (data not
shown). The interaction of other selectedcell lines with the
preSl-specific ligand was also inhibited (Fig. 4).

Segment of the HBV env Protein. The inhibition of attach-
ment of HepG2 ceilsto preS(21-47)- and HBs-cellulose by
IL-6suggested the possibility the IL-6Rcarried sites directly
involved in attachment of HBV. However, this notion is in-
compatible with the following findings. (a) The inhibitory
effect of I1.6 occurred at concentrations that are by several
orders of magnitude higher than physiologicalconcentrations.
(b) Sincethe number of IL-6R sites per cell for different cell
types is <2 x 104 (31, 32), and the Kd for the I1.6/I1-6R
reaction is between 100 and 700 pM, the concentration of
Ib6 required to prevent attachment of HepG2 and of other
cells to preS(21-47)- or HBs-cellulose (>20 nM) by far ex-
ceeded the concentration of IL-6required for occupancy of

the interaction between cells and preSl-specific ligands.
Further experiments were designed to determine whether
or not Ib6 reacted with the preS1ligand and thereby inhibited
the interaction between ceilsand preS(21-47)-or HBs-cellulose.
First, Ib6 was chromatographedon a minicolumnof preS(21-

lulose derivative and was subsequently eluted (49%) by 4 M

with preS(12-32)-cellulose, previously shown not to attach
any of the cell lines reacting with the preS1 ligand (2, 3),
most of the IL-6 remained unabsorbed. To confirm that at-
tachment of Ib6 to preSl-specific cellulose derivatives indeed

were used: serum-derived HBsAg containing S, M, and L protein; rHBsAg
produced in CHO cellsand either consisting ofS, M, and L protein (CHO
S-M-L rHBsAg) or of S and M protein only (CHO S-M HBsAg; 19);
rHBsAg produced in yeast consisting of S protein (S rHBsAg; 20); and
L protein produced in yeast (18).
the HBV receptor, preS(21-47)- and HBs-cellulose (40 mg
each) were premixed with I1.-6(10 #g), washed with 0.14 M
NaC1, I mM CaC12containing 10 mg/ml of BSA (TS-Ca-
BSA), and their ability to attach HepG2 cellswas tested. The
cellulose derivatives adsorbed 7 #g of IL-6as determinedby
ELISA and attached only background numbers of HepG2
cells (11%) in comparison with the respective cellulose de-
rivatives not pretreated with Ib6, which attached 93-97%
of the cells. These results provide evidence that the inhibi-
tory effectofIb6 on the reactionbetween preS(21-47)-cellulose
and cellsexpressingHBV receptorscanbe ascribedto a specific
interaction between the preS(21-47)region of the HBV env
protein and Ib6.
To show that IL-6 reacted not only with preSl-specific
ligands covalently linked to cellulosebut alsowith HBV env
proteins containing the preS1 sequence, a test for detecting
HBsAg-Ib6 complexes was designed. Such complexes were
detected in an ELISAutilizing polystyrene plates coated with
antibodies to HBV env proteins (anti- preS1 or anti-S) and
biotinylated antibodies to IL-6 as a probe. The association
between Ib6 and HBV env proteins could be demonstrated
only for HBsAg containing the preS1 sequence but not for
HBsAg containing S protein or S protein and the preS2 se-
quence only (Fig. 6). These results confirmedthat the preS1
region of the HBV env protein contained sites recognizing
I1:6. Similar results were obtained by an ELISA in which
plates coated with antibodies to S protein, present in each
of the envelope protein constituents of HBV, were used
(Fig. 7).

was determined in supernatant fluids after centrifugation of the treated

supernatant fluids was calculated and plotted. The concentration of IL-6
in lysates of untreated cells was in the range of 2.5-5.1 ng/ml, as calcu-
lated from a calibration curve relating ELLS&readings to concentration
of an Ib6 standard. Similar results were obtained with Wish, SK-N-SH,
and Con A-activated HUT 78 cells.

and recombinant L protein, respectively, were submitted to
ultrafiltration. The retention of I1-6 under the latter circum-
stances was nearly completely suppressed (94%) when the
peptide preS(12-47) was added at 50-M excess. The K~ for
the reaction between I1-6 and the preS1 segment of the HBV
env protein was calculated from the results of these experi-
ments (K~ = 4.0 +_ 0.94 x 109).

SegmentoftheHBV L Protein. Purified I1-6 reacts with the
preS1 region of the HBV env proteins, and the preS(21-47)
segment of the sequence is involved in this interaction.
Blocking of this region of the HBV env protein by I1-6 pre-
vented the interaction of HBV env proteins and of the pep-
tide preS(21-47) with cell surfacerecognition sites. The fol-
lowing results provide evidence that these recognition sites
are located on cell surface-associated I1-6.
Human PBMC do not produce I1.-6.LPS induces the syn-
thesis of I1.6 in PBMC, which are the major source of IL-6
producedby LPS-treated whole blood cultures (34, 35). The
majorityof human PBMC and promonocyticU937 cellsdid
not attach to preS(21-47)-celhlose. However, after stimula-
tion with LPS, these cellsattached to this cellulosederivative
(Fig. 8) and to HBs-cellulose (data not shown) but not to
preS(12-32)-cellulose.The attachment ofLPS-activatedU937
cellsto preS(21-47)-ceUulosewas abrogated by polyclonal an-
tibodies to I1.6. Polyclonal anti-IL-6 also inhibited the at-
tachment to preS(21-47)-celluloseof other cell lines (U266,
H9, FS-4, HepG2, COS-l, Namalwa, SK-N-SH, Cates 1B,
and Con A-activated MOLT-3) by 45-78%.
Partially purified preparations of the HBV receptor were
preparedby affinitychromatographyon preS(21-47)-cellulose
(3). A lysate from 107HepG2 cellswas chromatographed on
a minicolumn of preS(21-47)-ceUulose(8 mg) under condi-
tions described before for the receptor purification. A major
portion (78% = 570 pg) of I1.6 originally present in the
cell lysatewas attached to the cellulose derivative and subse-
quently eluted by 4 M MgC12. This indicates that I1.6 is
selectivelyremoved from crude celllysatesin agreementwith
the observed binding between I1-6 and the preS(21-47) seg-
ment ofthe HBV L protein. I1-6was alsoremovedfrom crude
cell lysates by affinity chromatography on columns of im-
mobilized anti-"receptor antibodies" prepared as described
before (3; data not shown).
Unlike mature forms of some other growth factors (36),
I1.6 is not cleavedfrom integral membraneprecursors.There-
fore, it seemed possible that I1.6 involved in the interaction
with the preS(21-47) segment of the preS1 sequence was
peripherally associatedwith cell membranes. To confirm that
this indeed was the case, cellswere pretreated at pH 4, con-
ditions known to release cell-associatedlymphokines while
preservingcellviability (17), and the attachmentofthe treated
cells to preS(21-47)-celluloseas well as the release from the
cells of I1-6 were measured. Treatment at pH 4 abrogated
the attachment to preS(21-47)-celluloseof the following cell
lines tested: HepG2, RPMI 8226, H9, FS-4, Wish, SK-N-
SH, Namalwa, Cates 1B, U266, COS-l, Con A-activated
HUT 78, and LPS-activated U937 cells. The release of II.-6
at pH 4 from ceUlines expressing the highest levelsof I1.6
was assayedby ELISA. Results shown in Fig. 9 indicate that
most of the II.-6was released from the cells at pH 4. These
results indicate that cell-associatedI1.6 is indeed involved in
the interaction between cellsand cellulose derivatives with
immobilized preS1 ligands. Not surprisingly, partial release
of I1.6 was also observed with mock-treatedcells, in agree-
ment with the observed shedding of HBV "receptors" into
the extracellular environment (2).
Initial attempts to characterize the receptorfor HBV indi-
cated that treatment ofdistinct celllines with PI-PLC resulted
in decreasedreactivity with the preS(21-47)binding site (Fig.
2). Subsequent results indicated that the component recog-
nizing the latter site was II-6. However, I1-6 is not attached
to cell membranes by a PI anchor. To resolve this apparent
discrepancy, I1-6 was measured in supernatant fluids after
treating cells with PI-PLC. Most of the cell-associated I1-6
was releasedafter such treatment (Fig. 9). These results agree
with the proposed role of I1.6 as a mediator of HBV attach-
ment to cells,and suggest that I1-6is functioning as an HBV
receptor anchored to the cellsurfacethrough another PI-PLC-
releasablecomponent(s). Preliminary results suggest that this
component(s) is a proteoglycan.
Discussion
Although the liveris the major target organ for HBV, cells
other than hepatocytes, including PBL, maybecome infected
with the virus. In accordance with this, receptors for HBV
weredetected on cellsofboth hepatic and extrahepatic origin
(2). It was anticipated that attempts to detect and charac-
terize HBV receptors on severalcell lines, rather than only
on cells of hepatic origin, would provide clues concerning
the nature of HBV receptors and an explanation for multiple
target cells (organs) for HBV. These expectations lead to an
experimental path finally revealingthat I1.6carries abinding
site for HBV. The production of Ib6 by a variety of cells
(37) mayexplain the miscellanyof target ceilsfor HBV. Some
of the ceUs(PBMC, promonocytic, and T cell lines) did not
express Ib6 constitutively and did not react with the cell
receptor binding site on HBV, but expressed both Ib6 and
the binding site for HBV after activation. This might ex-
plain the reported replication of HBV in PBMC (9) and pe-
ripheral T lymphocytes (8), and possibly contribute to ex-
plaining the reactivation of latent hepatitis virus infection
of circulating lymphoid cells after activation with LPS (38).
Aplastic anemiahas occasionallybeen diagnosed in patients
infected with HBV, and it was observed that exposure of
human bone marrow mononudear ceils to HBV resulted in
suppression of in vitro growth of severalhematopoieticpro-
genitor ceils (39). The interaction between II.-6 and HBV,
documented herein, might offer an explanation for the ob-
served inhibition of proliferation and differentiation of he-
matopoietic colony-forming cells by HBV.
The interaction between growth factors or growth factor
receptors with viral envelope proteins (10, 11, 14, 15), and
467 Neurath et al.
mimicking of cytokines or their receptors by virally encoded
proteins (12, 16), provide new insights into the replication
of the corresponding viruses and explanations for their effects
on the host immune system. The demonstration that HBV
utilizes Ib6 as a target for attachment to cells suggests that
this virus should be included in an apparently expanding family
of viral pathogens capable of modulating cell growth and
differentiation.
IL-6 involved in the interaction between HBV and cells
appeared to be associated with the cell periphery through
another component, attached to the cell membrane through
a PI anchor. Preliminary results suggest that this component(s)
is a proteoglycan (own unpublished data). This observation
appears to agree with the proposed role of proteoglycans as
modulators of growth factor activities (40), although no ex-
perimental evidence for the association of IL-6 with proteo-
glycans has been reported so far. Some of the proteoglycans
are linked to the cell membrane by a PI anchor (41), possibly
explaining the release of II.,6- and HBV-binding activity from
cells by PI-PLC. I1.-6and proteoglycans may possibly play a
dual role in attachment of HBV to cells.
The interaction between I1r and the preS1 region of the
HBV envelope appears to be responsible for the primary in-
teraction of HBV with cells. The precise details of cell-HBV
interactions, probably involving other cell membrane com-
ponents (proteoglycans?), and possibly also regions on the
HBV env protein other than the preS(21-47) segment, leading
to productive infection ofceUs, remain to be established. This
task is complicated by the unavailability of a system for quan-
titating infectious HBV. The location of the preS(21-47)
binding site on I1.-6 and its similarity to or distinctiveness
from the domain involved in interaction with Ib6R also re-
main to be explored.
