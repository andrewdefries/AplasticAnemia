Background: Hematology analyzers may ineffectively recognize abnormal cells, and manual differential counts may be imprecise
for leukopenic samples.We evaluated the efficacy of the Hematoflow method for determining the leukocyte differential in leuko-
penicsamplesandcomparedthismethodwiththemanualdifferentialmethod.
Methods:Weselected249bloodsamplesfrom167patientswithleukopenia(WBCcounts,500–2,000/μL)foranalysisinthisstudy.
The EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples were analyzed using an automatic blood cell counter (DxH800; Beckman Coulter, USA)
andflowcytometry(FC500;BeckmanCoulter)byusingCytodiffreagentandanalysissoftware(BeckmanCoulter).Hematoflowre-
sults were selected or calculated from DxH800 and Cytodiff results. Two trained pathologists performed a manual differential
countbycounting50–100cells.
Results:The precision of the Hematoflow method was superior to that of the manual method in counting 5 leukocyte subpopula-
tions, immature granulocytes (IGs), and blasts. Blasts were detected in all 45 cases (100%) by Hematoflow. The correlation of the
Cytodiff blast count to the reference count was high (r = 0.8325). For all other cell populations, the correlation of the Hematoflow
resultswiththereferencecountwasstrongerthanthatoftheothermanualcountswiththereferencecount.
Conclusions:The Hematoflow differential counting method is more reproducible and sensitive than manual counting, and is rela-
tively easy to perform. In particular, this method detected leukemic blasts more sensitively than manual differential counts. The

Diagnostic Hematology KJLM
INTRODUCTION
The majority of hematology cell analyzers are useful for
quantitative enumeration of leukocytes, but they are rela-
tively ineffective in qualitative recognition of abnormal cells
[1]. Hematology cell analyzers can detect abnormal differ-
ential patterns or abnormal cells and “flag” them. However,
in most cases, the presence of abnormal cells must be estab-
lished by microscopic examination of blood smears [2, 3].
Manual differential counting is the reference method for
white blood cell (WBC) differential counts, but it is labor-
intensive and time-consuming with variable reproducibility
and cannot distinguish between cells on the basis of qualita-
tive differences [4]. The incidence of leukopenia has mark-
edly increased in hospital laboratories in recent years, largely
due to an increase in the number of cancer and leukemia
patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy [5, 6].
Manual differential counts of leukopenic samples are noto-
riously imprecise, which can be attributed to the insufficient
number of countable cells in these samples. Further, the
classification of cells in these samples is generally both diffi-
cult and time-intensive [7]. Rapid and accurate confirma-
tion of abnormal cells by flow cytometry is required to
reach a final diagnostic conclusion.

of cells is the identification of cell types that cannot be iden-
tified by the current morphologic differentiation techniques
[8-10]. Recently, the Hematoflow method was introduced
(Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA). This method com-
bines an automatic hematology cell analyzer (DxH800;
Beckman Coulter), flow cytometry (FC500; Beckman
Coulter), and Cytodiff (5-colors 6-antibodies flow cytome-
try using premixed reagent & analysis software; Beckman
Coulter) [11]. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of de-
termining the leukocyte differential by using the Hemato-
flow method in leukopenic samples and compared it with
the manual differential method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1.Patientsandsamples
Two hundred forty-nine EDTA-anticoagulated blood
samples from 167 patients (88 males and 79 females; age,
1-75 yr; mean age, 38 yr) who had a WBC count of 500-
2,000/μL in routine CBC were selected for analysis. The pa-
tients’ diagnoses were as follows: 65 cases of AML, 34 cases
of ALL, 15 cases of aplastic anemia, 14 cases of malignant
lymphomas, 10 cases of solid tumors, 10 cases of MDS, 1
case of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and
18 cases of other hematologic diseases. Blasts were discov-
ered during the reference count in 36 of 125 AML samples
and 9 of 46 ALL samples. None of the samples from MDS
patients harbored blasts. This study was approved by the In-
stitutional Review Board of the Catholic University of Ko-
rea College of Medicine.
2.AnalysisusingHematoflow
Blood samples were analyzed with an automatic blood
cell analyzer (DxH800) for routine CBC, and 8,920 leuko-
cytes were counted per sample. We then analyzed the same
blood samples for determining the leukocyte differential
using flow cytometry (FC500) in conjunction with a pre-
mixed Cytodiff reagent and analysis software. The Cytodiff
panel included CD36-FITC, CD2-PE, CD294-PE, CD19-
ECD, CD16-PC5, and CD45-PC7 antibodies. The leuko-
cytes were differentiated into 16 cell populations (B-lym-
phocytes, CD16- T-lymphocytes, CD16+ T and NK cells, T
and NK lymphocytes, total lymphocytes, CD16 monocytes,
CD16+ monocytes, total monocytes, immature granulo-
cytes [IGs], total eosinophils, mature neutrophils, total neu-
trophils, B blasts, T blasts, non-B-non-T blasts, and total
basophils; Fig. 1). Analysis procedures were conducted in
accordance with the manufacturer’s manual. In brief, 100
μL of whole blood samples was mixed with 10 μL of Cyto-
diff reagent and incubated for 20 min at room temperature.
Red blood cells were broken down with lysing solution
(Versalyse solution; Beckman Coulter) for 15 min. Without
washing, 10,000 cells were collected using a flow cytometer
(FC500) and the Cytodiff results were analyzed automati-
cally by the analysis software. The analysis software is self-
gating and separates populations by automatic logic path-
ways. As instructed by the manual, the gates were only ad-
justed in cases of large debris contamination or incomplete
separation of basophils and myeloblasts. All samples were
analyzed in duplicate. All the Hematoflow results, except
eosinophil and IG counts, were obtained using the Cytodiff
reagent. We used the DxH800 eosinophil count as the He-
matoflow eosinophil count because the DxH800 eosinophil
count was more highly correlated to the reference eosino-
phil count than that obtained using Cytodiff. Hematoflow
IG count was calculated by subtracting the DxH800 eosino-
phil count from the sum of the Cytodiff IG count and Cyto-
diff eosinophil count, because the IGs and eosinophils were
not well separated in Cytodiff counting.
3.Manualdifferentialcounting
A trained hematology technician and a hematopatholo-
gist did manual differential counts by counting 50-100 cells.
We selected the manual counts done by hematopathologist
as reference counts. Manual counting may increase the
sampling error rate [7]. We added the number of metamy-
elocytes, myelocytes, and promyelocytes to obtain the num-
ber of IGs in the manual count.
4.Statisticalanalysis
We used MedCalc v11.2 (Mariakerke, Belgium) and Ex-
cel 2007 (Redmond, WA, USA) to perform Fisher’s F test
for analysis of repeatability and Pearson’s correlation test for
correlation analysis.
RESULTS
1.Analysistimeandgateadjustment
The average acquisition time for 20 leukopenic samples
(10,000 events) by Hematoflow was approximately 90 min,
including incubation and reading time, and the active labor
time was 15 min. In Cytodiff counting, gates were adjusted
in 19 out of 247 cases (7.7%). In 2 cases, adjustments were
made because of large debris contamination and in 17
cases, they were made because of incomplete separation be-
tween basophils and myeloblasts. In both cases of large de-
bris contamination, the contamination was only observed
during the first run, but not during the second run.

2.Leukocytesubpopulations
The repeatability of the Hematoflow method in counting
5 leukocyte subpopulations, IGs, and blasts was superior to
that of the manual differential method (Table 1). The mean
differences between repeated Cytodiff counts were 1.24±
2.70%, 0.98±1.53%, and 0.85±1.19% for neutrophils, lym-
phocytes and monocytes, respectively. When counted man-
ually, the mean differences between repeated counts were
much higher (5.4±5.8%, 6.1±5.6%, and 3.4±4.7%, respec-
tively, P<0.001). Cytodiff counts for neutrophils, lympho-
cytes, and monocytes were highly correlated with the refer-
ence counts (r=0.9704, r=0.9724, and r=0.8981, respec-
tively).

by the Cytodiff count was 0.48±2.33% and was lower than
that in the case of manual counting (0.7±1.4%, P<0.001).
However, in the case of the eosinophil counts, the correla-
tion of the reference count with the DxH800 count (r=0.
8766) was higher than that with the manual count (r=0.
8222) or the Cytodiff count (r=0.6671). Therefore, eosino-
phil counting by DxH800 was used as the eosinophil count
in Hematoflow.
The distinction between basophil and non-B-non-T blast
populations was not particularly clear. In such cases, the cell
populations were considered to represent either basophils
or non-B-non-T blasts on the basis of the median fluores-
cence level (<3.5: non-B-non-T blasts, ≥3.5: basophils).
The mean difference between repeated basophil assays by
Cytodiff count was 0.32±0.61% and was slightly lower than
that in the case of manual counting (0.6±1.6%, P<0.001).
The correlation of the basophil count to the reference count
was high in the case of Cytodiff count (r=0.8727) and was
higher than that for manual counting (r=0.7886). DxH800
basophil counts, however, were poorly correlated with the
reference count (r=0.0389; Table 1). When non-B-non-T
blasts were not present, we obtained clear basophil signals
in Cytodiff (Fig. 2).
3.Blasts
Blasts were detected in all 45 cases (100%) by Hemato-
flow method and in 17 cases (37.8%) by manual counting
method (Figs. 2, 3). The mean difference between repeated

blast assays by Hematoflow count was 0.65±1.99% and was
lower than that obtained by manual counts (1.7±6.6%,
P <0.001). The correlation of the blast count to the refer-
ence count was similar for the Cytodiff count (r=0.8325)
and the manual count (r=0.8627).
4.ImmatureGranulocytes
The Hematoflow IG count correlated more strongly with
the reference count than the Cytodiff IG count (Table 1).
The mean difference between repeated IG assays by Hema-
toflow count was 0.71±2.16% and was slightly lower than
that in the case of the manual count (0.8±3.4%, P<0.001).
The correlation of the Hematoflow IG count to the reference
count (r=0.3639) was higher than that of the manual count
(r=0.2170). Type III granulocytes were sometimes counted
as IGs, especially in 1 PNH case, because the type III neu-
trophils are CD16 negative cells (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
The slides from leukopenic samples often do not have a
sufficient number of cells to count, and it is difficult to ob-
serve a cell distribution in the ideal zone. The majority of
leukopenic samples are collected from patients receiving
chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, which can cause altered
morphologies of the cells [12]. This makes the manual dif-
ferential count of leukopenic samples more difficult. How-
ever, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) or presence of
blasts is critically important for patients. The average time
required for the Hematoflow counts of 20 leukopenic sam-
ples (10,000 events) was approximately 90 min, including
incubation and reading time, and the active labor time was

only 15 min (less than 1 min per case). Manual differential
counting requires slide making, staining, drying, and mi-
croscopic examination. It is very time-consuming and it is
difficult to conduct differential counts of leukopenic sam-
ples. The throughput of manual differential counting of leu-
kopenic samples depends on the leukocyte count, skill of
the personnel, and active labor time, but it is usually more
than 5 min per sample. Therefore, the throughput of the
Hematoflow method is acceptable.
Gates were adjusted in 19 of 247 Cytodiff cases (7.7%)
due to large debris contamination (2 cases) and incomplete
separation between basophils and myeloblasts (17 cases).
The 2 cases involving large debris contamination exhibited
this problem only in the first run, but not in a repeated run.
Therefore, repeated analysis is recommended when large
debris is present. As large debris is rarely present in samples
from non-leukemia patients, these samples do not require
any additional work. Therefore, this method may prove
more valuable for non-leukemic patients than for leukemic
patients.
The repeatability of the Hematoflow method was superior
to that of the manual differential counting method in the
counting of 5 leukocyte subpopulations, IGs, and blasts. Ad-
ditionally, the correlation of counts obtained using the He-
matoflow method to the reference counts was also quite
good. This means that in leukopenic samples, the leukocyte
differential obtained using the Hematoflow method is more
reproducible and sensitive than that obtained using other
methods, including the manual differential method. In par-
ticular, the mean difference between repeated Cytodiff neu-
trophil assays was far lower than that between repeated
manual counts. This might facilitate reproducible ANC
counts in patients with leukopenia.
The mean difference between repeated monocyte assays
by Cytodiff count was much lower than that by manual
counts. The reference monocyte count showed high corre-
lation with the Cytodiff count (r=0.8981), which was much
higher than that with the DxH800 count (r=0.5817). This
means that the morphology of other leukocytes in the leu-
kopenic samples could have been seriously altered, possibly
by processes such as vacuolation, making it difficult to visu-
ally differentiate them from monocytes.
The eosinophil count from DxH800 was superior to that
of the other methods tested. Hematology cell analyzers are
quite effective in eosinophil counting [13, 14]. The separa-
tion of IGs and eosinophils by automatic gating in the Cy-
todiff method is not an efficient method for distinguishing
IGs from eosinophils. Therefore, we recommend using the
DxH800 eosinophil results and the calculated IG count as
the Hematoflow values for these cell types.
While other researchers have reported a low correlation
between the Cytodiff basophil count and reference counts
[8], we found a high correlation between these counts (r=
0.8727). This is due to CD2 + CRTH2. The CRTH2 is ex-
pressed in activated T-cells, eosinophils, and basophils.
Separation between basophils and non-B-non-T blast pop-
ulations was not effective in the Hematoflow method. In
these cases, the cell populations were counted as either ba-
sophils or non-B-non-T blasts using the median fluores-
cence level (<3.5: non-B-non-T blasts, ≥3.5: basophils).
Because clear basophil signals were obtained in cases with-
out non-B-non-T blasts, this calculation was not required
for non-AML samples. The blast-detection rate using He-
matoflow was 100%, which is much higher than the rate
achievable by microscopic examination. The detection of
rare blasts in leukemia patients is very important [15]. The
precision of blast detection by Hematoflow method was su-
perior to that of the manual counting method. The correla-
tion of the blast count by the Hematoflow method to the
reference count was similar. It may be useful to screen sam-
ples for the presence of blasts using Cytodiff. If blasts are
detected by Cytodiff, confirmation of the blasts by slide re-
view is recommended, especially in new patients.
The repeatability of remaining cell population counts was
excellent when the Hematoflow method was used, even for
counts made from leukopenic samples. The significance of
differential counts of subsets of lymphocytes has been well
established, and each cell population has a distinct clinical
significance [16-18].
Cytodiff categorizes the PNH type III granulocytes as
IGs, because the type III neutrophils are CD16 negative
[19]. If a higher than normal Hematoflow IG count is de-
tected in a patient without a reason for the left shift of neu-
trophils, PNH should be suspected.
In this study, we evaluated a new WBC differential me-
thod. The Hematoflow method uses flow cytometry (FC500)
together with a hematology cell analyzer (DxH800). The
Hematoflow differential counting method is a more repro-
ducible and sensitive method than manual counting, and is
relatively easy to perform. In particular, the Hematoflow
method is much more sensitive than the manual differential
counting method in the detection of leukemic blasts. The
Hematoflow method provides more cell population data [11]
than the manual differential count, including blast lineages.
In conclusion, the Hematoflow method is very useful in
supplementing the automated cell counting. The technique
is expected to be even more useful if data from the hematol-
ogy cell analyzer and flow cytometry can be automatically
