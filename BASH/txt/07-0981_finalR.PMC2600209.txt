From 2002 through 2005, an outbreak of feline leu-
kemia virus (FeLV) occurred in Florida panthers (Puma
concolor coryi). Clinical signs included lymphadenopathy,
anemia, septicemia, and weight loss; 5 panthers died. Not
associated with FeLV outcome were the genetic heritage
of the panthers (pure Florida vs. Texas/Florida crosses)
and co-infection with feline immunodeﬁciency virus. Ge-
netic analysis of panther FeLV, designated FeLV-Pco, de-
termined that the outbreak likely came from 1 cross-spe-
cies transmission from a domestic cat. The FeLV-Pco virus
was closely related to the domestic cat exogenous FeLV-A
subgroup in lacking recombinant segments derived from
endogenous FeLV. FeLV-Pco sequences were most similar
to the well-characterized FeLV-945 strain, which is highly
virulent and strongly pathogenic in domestic cats because
of unique long terminal repeat and envelope sequences.
These unique features may also account for the sever-
ity of the outbreak after cross-species transmission to the
panther.
The Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi) is the only
remaining puma (also called cougar or mountain lion)
population east of the Mississippi River in North America.
This population, which is conﬁned to a small portion of
southern Florida, was originally described as 1 of 30 sub-
species of puma (1). By the 1970s, Florida panther numbers
diminished to ≈30 because of hunting and habitat destruc-
tion. Since the early 1980s, the population has been stud-
ied extensively by monitoring a large proportion of adults
by radio telemetry (2–5). In the early 1990s, concern over
the fate of the population increased as signs of inbreeding
and loss of genetic diversity were reported. These observa-
tions included low levels of genetic variation, high levels
of sperm abnormalities, and increased incidence of heart
defects relative to other puma populations and felids in
general (2,3). In 1995, faced with the compounding ef-
fects of reduced genetic variation, probable depression of
numbers from inbreeding, and evidence of compromised
health, wildlife managers released 8 female Texas pumas
into southern Florida to increase genetic variation and ame-
liorate the physiologic effects of inbreeding. Subsequently,
increases were noted in the population of individuals of
mixed genetic heritage, genetic variation, and population
size; a decrease was noted in incidence of deleterious phys-
iologic traits in crosses between the pure Florida panthers
and the Texas females (4).
The Florida panther population, as well as other North
and South American puma populations, has historically
tested negative for exposure to or infection by feline leuke-
mia viruses (FeLVs). A serosurvey of 38 free-ranging Flor-
ida panthers sampled during 1978–1991 reported complete
absence of FeLV antigen (3). However, since early 2001,
23 panthers (>33% of the population) were found to be pos-
itive for FeLV antibodies, and at least 5 adult panthers were
positive for FeLV antigen and subsequently died. In the 3
panthers available for necropsy, evidence was found of
diseases compatible with FeLV infection (5). We describe
the molecular genetic characterization of circulating FeLV
strains isolated from the 2001–2005 outbreak and compare
them with FeLV strains isolated from domestic cats.
FeLV is transmitted horizontally among domestic
cats through body secretions (6) and was the ﬁrst retro-
virus shown to cause both neoplastic and degenerative
disorders (7,8). Like other retroviruses, FeLV induces im-

munosuppression in its host. Although the mechanism of
immunopathogenesis is unclear, viral envelope proteins
may be involved (9). FeLV envelope (env) and the long
terminal repeat (LTR) sequences have been suggested as
being involved in determination of disease sequelae, virus
transactivation, and virus replication (10–12). There are 4
naturally occurring viral subgroups of exogenous FeLV
(A, B, C, and T) that are distinguished genetically by se-
quence differences in the env gene and functionally by
receptor interactions required for cell entry (13). FeLV-A
is the predominant subgroup circulating in feral cats and
is often only weakly pathogenic (14). FeLV-B, -C, and -T
subgroups arise in vivo through recombination between ex-
ogenous FeLV strains and domestic cat endogenous FeLVs
(8,15). The endogenous feline leukemia provirus sequenc-
es are present in the genome of the domestic cat and are
transmitted vertically as integral components of the germ-
line (16). Endogenous feline leukemia virus sequences by
themselves do not produce infectious virus. However, the
pathogenic subgroups, FeLV-B, -C, and –T, are generated
by recombination in the env region between exogenous
subgroup A virus and endogenous proviral sequences (8).
FeLV-A, -B, -C, and -T are often associated, respectively,
with thymic lymphoma of T-cell origin (17), tumor forma-
tion (18), aplastic anemia and bone marrow dysfunction
(17), and lymphoid depletion and immunodeﬁciency dis-
ease (13). We used viral genome sequence and phyloge-
netic analyses to identify and characterize the virulent and
pathogenic FeLV in Florida panthers and compare it with
FeLV strains in the domestic cat.
Materials and Methods
Sample Collection and Testing
Blood and tissue samples were collected from 61 free-
ranging pumas captured during 1988–2004, mainly from
south Florida. Samples were stored at –70°C and tested for
FeLV antigen and antibody and for feline immunodeﬁcien-
cy virus (FIV) by Western blot as described (5) (Figure 1).
PCR Ampliﬁcation of Proviral DNA
Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes, lymph
nodes, spleen, intestines, or bone marrow of 61 panthers,
including all that were positive for FeLV antigen and an-
tibody. Proteinase K digestion was followed by standard
extraction using the QIAGEN DNeasy tissue DNA extrac-
tion kit (#69504; QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). Isolated
DNA was visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel
and quantiﬁed by using a UV spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). PCR primers were designed from the
conserved regions of env and LTR sequences of domestic cat
FeLV (GenBank accession nos. M18247, M18248, M12500,
AY374189, X00188, M14331, M23025, AY364318). PCR
primers amplifying env (437 bp and 1,700 bp) and env/LTR
(725 bp) are listed in Figure 2. The forward env/LTR primer
(LTR4) was designed by using panther FeLV (FeLV-Pco)
envelope sequence additionally.
PCR was performed by using ≈50 ng of genomic
DNA in a 50-μL reaction with 50 mmol/L KCl; 10 mmol/L

and 2.5 U of Taq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA). PCR was run on a GeneAmp PCR
system 9700 thermocycler (Applied Biosytems) under the
following conditions: 9 min 45 s at 95°C; then a touch-
down of annealing temperatures to reduce nonspeciﬁc am-

60°C (3 cycles), 58°C (5 cycles), 56°C (5 cycles), 54°C (5

(437-bp env), 1 min (LTR) or 2 min 20 s (1,698-bp env) at
72°C for extension; and a ﬁnal extension at 72°C for 7 min.
PCR products were examined after electrophoresis on a 1%
agarose gel. Primers and unincorporated deoxynucleotide
triphosphates were removed by using Microcon YM (Mil-
lipore, Billerica, MA, USA) technology or exonuclease I
and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham, Piscataway,
NJ, USA) (Figure 2). Representative PCR products from
independent ampliﬁcations were cloned and sequenced.
For the env and LTR sequences, products were cloned from
4 PCR products each (Figure 2). Cloning was performed
with a TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA
was isolated from 6 to 16 clones from each reaction prod-
uct by using a QIAGEN Miniprep Kit. Sequences were ob-
tained from clones by using internal primers in standard
ABI BigDye terminator (Applied Biosystems) reactions.
Anticontamination measures were taken at all steps of PCR
ampliﬁcation and after PCR processing. Pre-PCR setup
was performed in a laminar ﬂow hood, DNA was added in
a free-standing containment hood in a separate room, and
all post-PCR manipulations were performed under a fume
hood in a third room. All surfaces were washed with a 10%
bleach solution, and each hood was exposed to UV light for
30 min before and after use. PCR tubes with individual lids,
rather than 96-well plates, were used and kept closed ex-
cept when reagents and DNA were being added or aliquots
were extracted for use. DNA tubes were opened only un-
der their designated hoods; to avoid cross-contamination,
tubes were never open simultaneously. Water and a sample
from an FeLV-negative puma were run with every reaction
as negative controls. Positive controls of known sequence
were also run for each reaction: 1 from a domestic cat, 1
from a known seropositive Florida panther (FP-115 or FP-
122), or both.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Sequences from env and LTR were analyzed sepa-
rately. For analysis relative to known domestic cat FeLV
sequences, we included FeLV-945, FeLVA-3281, FeLVA-

(19) and veriﬁed visually (20). MODELTEST (21) was
used for env and LTR analysis to estimate the optimal
model of sequence evolution; these settings were incorpo-
rated into subsequent analyses. Minimum-evolution trees
were constructed from models of substitution speciﬁed by
MODELTEST; starting trees were obtained by the neigh-
bor-joining method, followed by application of a tree-bi-
section-reconnection branch-swapping algorithm during a
heuristic search for the optimal tree. Maximum-parsimony
analysis used a heuristic search of starting trees obtained
by stepwise addition and followed by tree-bisection-re-
connection. Maximum likelihood parameters speciﬁed by
MODELTEST selected the general time-reversible model
of substitution; they included empirical base frequencies
and estimated rate matrix and corrected for among-site rate
variation (γ distribution). A bootstrap analysis that used

Results
FeLV Serosurvey and PCR Ampliﬁcation
The ﬁrst sign of an emerging outbreak of FeLV in the
free-ranging Florida panther population was the 2001 detec-
tion of FeLV antibodies, FeLV proviral PCR, or both, in 8
pumas from the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge,
private lands, or the northern range of Big Cypress Swamp
(Figure 1). Antigen-positive results and documented death
compatible with FeLV infection ﬁrst occurred in FP-115 in
2002 near the Okaloacoochee Slough State Forest (5). With
the exception of FP-108 and FP-119, found in the central
region of Big Cypress National Park, all 19 other FeLV-ex-
posed panthers were found north of Interstate 75 (Figure 1)
(5). During the next 2 years, 4 additional antigen-positive
panthers died; FeLV-related disease was suspected for 2
(FP-123 and FP-132) and conﬁrmed for 2 (FP-109 and FP-
122) (5). Additionally, 8 panthers (FP-67, FP-78, FP-82,
FP-96, FP-99, UCFP43, FP-108, FP-118) that were antigen
negative but seropositive or PCR positive for FeLV died
during the outbreak, but their deaths were not attributed to
FeLV (5).
Retrospective screening of 6 panthers (FP-67, FP-78,
FP-82, FP-109, FP-122, FP-132) for antibody or antigen or
by PCR demonstrated that they had not had FeLV infection
before this outbreak. FP-96 in the Florida Panther National
Wildlife Refuge was one of the ﬁrst to have documented
FeLV exposure; this panther displayed a latent infection,
being PCR positive in 2001 and in 2002. Three panthers
(FP-104, FP-107, FP-119) likely cleared the virus; after
initial positive test results, they were seronegative on fol-
low-up testing. Positive FIV antibody results by Western
blot were found for 11 of the 19 FeLV-exposed and 2 of
the 5 clinically affected panthers (Figure 1). An analysis
of 21 microsatellites (short tandem repeats) showed that 6
of the 19 FeLV-exposed and 2 of the 5 antigen-positive
panthers were crosses with some Texas heritage and that
the rest were pure Florida panthers (W.E. Johnson et al.,
unpub. data).
Phylogenetic Analysis
An alignment of FeLV-Pco, FeLV-A, FeLV-B, and
endogenous env nucleotide sequence (Figure 3) established
the concordance of FeLV-Pco with subgroup A and found
a lack of recombination of FeLV-Pco with endogenous
FeLV-Pco sequence. The absence of endogenous sequenc-
es was not unexpected because pumas and other cats out-
side of the genus Felis do not carry endogenous FeLV se-
quences (23,24). The FeLV-Pco was classiﬁed as subgroup
A on the basis of this lack of evidence for recombination
with endogenous FeLV across 1,794 bp of FeLV-Pco env
sequence (Figure 3) and on the basis of in vitro receptor
utilization studies (5). The aligned sequences of the LTRs
and the env region were analyzed as separate datasets. For
both datasets, phylogenetic analyses identiﬁed the FeLV-
Pco sequences as monophyletic (Figure 4). Each had strong
bootstrap support for a clade containing all FeLV-Pco but
none of the previously sequenced domestic cat FeLVs (Fig-
ure 4). This pattern was consistent with a recent and focal
introduction of the virus. Furthermore, the 376-bp nucleo-
tide env sequence obtained from the earliest cases of FeLV
exposure (Pco-972 and Pco-991, found respectively in the
Florida Panther National Wildlife Reserve and northern
Big Cypress National Preserve), were identical in sequence
to the later FeLV cases found in the Okaloacoochee Slough
State Forest (Figure 2; online Appendix Figure 1, avail-
able from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/14/2/252-appG1.htm).
On the basis of >50 cloned envelope sequences (Figure 4;
Table), the FeLV-Pco viruses associated with this outbreak
were highly conserved. The mean percentage nucleotide
and amino acid sequence differences of the FeLV env gene
among FeLV-Pco sequences were 0.4% (nucleotide) and
0.1% (amino acid). Of published FeLV sequences avail-
able in GenBank, the closest strain was the domestic cat

virus FeLV-945, according to LTR and env sequence com-
parisons (Figure 4); calculated differences were only 1.5%
(nucleotide) and 3.5% (amino acid) between FeLV-Pco
and FeLV-945 env sequences (Table).
Because FeLV-945 is well characterized and highly
virulent in the domestic cat (11,25), sequence elements
associated with disease determination (env) and transcrip-
tion enhancement (LTR) in FeLV-945 were examined in
FeLV-Pco. In the envelope protein, 10 signature amino acid
residues (found within the surface glycoprotein) that were
shared between FeLV-Pco and FeLV-945 were distinctive
from other strains of FeLV (Figure 5). Of these synapomor-
phic sites, 2 were in variable region A, which in FeLV-945
deﬁnes the speciﬁcity required for viral binding to receptors
(25). Three of the sites were within the proline-rich region,
which in FeLV-945 encodes for conformational changes
required for FeLV cell entry (25). The FeLV-Pco LTR se-
quences had 1 copy of a 40-bp enhancer element that has
been characterized in FeLV-945 (online Appendix Figure 2,
available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/14/2/252-appG2.
htm) (12). Finally, the exogenous domestic cat FeLV-945
isolate, which FeLV-Pco strains resemble (Figures 4, 5),
displays unusual repeat junctions where the transcription
factor c-Myb is known to bind in FeLV-945, possibly accel-
erating the rate of transcription of the virus (Figure 2, online
Appendix Figure 2) (12). FeLV-Pco also contains 1 copy
of this repeat junction (Figure 2, panel A; online Appendix
Figure 2), which supports the conclusion that FeLV-Pco is
derived from a strain closely related to and perhaps from
the pathogenic FeLV-945 domestic cat strain. FeLV-945 is
unusual in that its severe pathogenicity does not involve re-
combination with endogenous FeLV in domestic cats. That
FeLV-Pco pathogenesis in pumas is due to a virus similar
to FeLV-945 that was not derived from endogenous recom-
bination is consistent with the complete lack of endogenous
FeLV sequences in the puma genome.
Discussion
We genetically characterized the FeLV that emerged
in the previously naive free-ranging Florida panther popu-
lation. According to the retrospective longitudinal antibody
and antigen results and the virus’ geographic distribution,
the virus was likely introduced into the Florida panther
population in 2001 (Figure 1) (3). From the earliest detect-
ed panthers with FeLV (2001) to the most recent (2005),
the FeLV-Pco env sequences were nearly identical, which
indicates that the source of infection was likely a single
domestic cat. FP-96, resident in the Florida Panther Na-
tional Wildlife Reserve area in January of 2001, was the
ﬁrst panther with exposure detectable by PCR. The virus
then spread north and east through the population, affect-
ing individual panthers in Big Cypress (FP-100, FP-119),
Seminole Indian Reservation (FP-118), and Okaloacooch-

FP-132) (Figure 1; online Technical Appendix, available
from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/14/2/252-Techapp.htm).
Texas genetic heritage did not protect infected pumas from
disease associated with FeLV; pure Florida panthers and
pumas died after having symptoms compatible with FeLV
(Figure 1).
Among characterized strains of FeLV, domestic cat
FeLV-945 was closest in sequence to FeLV-Pco in the pan-
thers. FeLV-945 in domestic cats was originally isolated as
the predominant FeLV species from a geographic cohort of
21 infected domestic cats and is known to cause non–T-cell
diseases characterized by degenerative and proliferative
changes of myeloid and erythroid origin (26). Although
FeLV-945 is included among FeLV subgroup A isolates
on the basis of cell receptor utilization, its distinctive en-
velope and LTR sequence signatures differ from those of
other FeLV-A strains (25). At the amino-terminal of the
envelope sequence, the surface glycoprotein, also known as
gp70, encodes the receptor-binding domain, within which
are 2 variable regions, A and B. These deﬁne the speciﬁc-
ity required for binding. Further downstream, a proline-rich
region encodes for the conformational changes required for
viral entry (25).
The 10 envelope amino acid residues synapomorphic
in FeLV-Pco and FeLV-945 included 2 in variable region
A and 3 in the proline-rich region (Figures 2, 5). In FeLV-
945 LTR, three 21-bp repeats form 2 junctions: 1 junction
is formed by the ﬁrst repeat and the adjacent second re-
peat; the other is formed by the second and third repeats.
Each junction includes a c-Myb binding site that increases
the rate of viral replication through the recruitment of tran-
scriptional coactivator binding protein (cAMP response el-
ement) (11). FeLV-Pco LTR sequences had 1 copy of the
repeat junction (Figure 2, online Appendix Figure 2) (12).
Upstream, LTR transcriptional enhancer elements repeated
in tandem have been associated with thymic lymphomas
and are found only in 1 copy in non–T-cell disease (26).
Like FeLV-945, FeLV-Pco lacks this duplication (Figure
2, online Appendix Figure 2).
In the panthers, clinical and pathologic ﬁndings of
FeLV-Pco in this outbreak consisted of FeLV-related dis-
eases of non–T-cell origin. These ﬁndings are consistent
with the pathologic changes associated with FeLV-945 in
the domestic cat. Necropsy ﬁndings of FP-115 documented
interstitial pneumonia, septicemia, and suppurative lymph-
adenopathy. Examination of FP-109 1 month before it died
found lymphadenopathy, anemia, lymphopenia, and lym-
phoid hyperplasia. FP-122 had similar ﬁndings 1 month
before it died, including lymphadenopathy, muscle wast-
ing, and hypercellular bone marrow with >90% hematopoi-
etic cells. FP-132 necropsy ﬁndings included severe pallor
(indicative of anemia), bronchointerstitial pneumonia, ab-
scesses, lymphadenopathy, and hypercellular bone marrow
with >90% hematopoietic cells (5). FeLV-Pco is therefore
similar to the unique and virulent domestic cat strain FeLV-
945 of FeLV subgroup A, in env and LTR sequence and
in non–T-cell disease outcome. In the domestic cat, FeLV-

945 causes multicentric lymphoma, myeloproliferative
disorder, and anemia and has never been associated with
thymic lymphoma (26). These ﬁndings shared between
FeLV-945 and FeLV-Pco implicate the 10 identiﬁed amino
acid synapomorphies (Figure 5) as plausible determinants
of disease. Further study of these env regions from T-cell
and non–T-cell disease manifestations of FeLV occurring
in comparative felid species is warranted and may eluci-
date the key sequence determinants of disease outcome in
FeLV.
The role of FIV-related immune suppression, if any,
in this outbreak is uncertain. Although recent studies of T-
lymphocyte proﬁles in FIV-infected wild lions and pumas
suggest that CD4 depletion occurs (27), our survey found
that co-infection with FIV was present in 2 but absent in 3
FeLV-associated deaths. FIV-positive panthers could have
served as a reservoir for the spread of FeLV through the
population because the earliest detected FeLV-exposed pan-
thers (FP-96 and FP-99) were FIV positive. Furthermore,
the ﬁrst panther (FP-115) detected with FeLV-compatible
disease in the Okaloacoochee Slough State Forest region
was positive for FIV and FeLV for at least 6 months.
An FIV serosurvey suggested an overall increase in
the prevalence of FIV in Florida panthers in recent years.
During 1999–2000, 3 (15%) of 20 panthers tested had FIV-
positive results by Western blot. In contrast, 13 (76%) of
17 panthers tested during 2004–2005 in the FeLV-endemic
Okaloacoochee Slough State Forest region (Figure 1) were
FIV positive (5). These results could support a role for
FIV-mediated immune depletion in FeLV pathogenesis. In
domestic cats, FIV and FeLV co-infections have resulted
in conﬂicting interpretations (28–32). In contrast to FIV,
which is found in many species of wild felids (33), FeLV
in nondomestic felids has been reported only a few times,
in captive cats, with documented or suspected exposure to
infected domestic cats (5). Serologic survey of free-ranging
populations found an absence of FeLV in pumas in Cali-
fornia (34), among felids in Botswana (35), and among 38
free-ranging Florida panthers sampled during 1978–1991
(3). However, Jessup et al. (36) document a case of FeLV
in a young adult male free-ranging puma captured from a
college campus in Sacramento, California. Necropsy of this
cougar found generalized lymphadenopathy and lymphop-
roliferative disease. These necropsy results are consistent
with and similar to the clinical ﬁndings of the FeLV-posi-
tive panthers reported here.
The outbreak of FeLV in the previously naive popula-
tion of endangered Florida panthers raised questions about
management of free-ranging pumas. In response, the Florida
Department of Fisheries and Wildlife began a widespread
vaccination program of Florida panthers; no additional
FeLV cases have since been detected among them (5).
This emerging disease outbreak was characterized by
2 factors. First, because of its unique heritage and popular-
ity, the Florida panther has been the most intensively moni-
tored wild felid in North America. Second, the extensive
veterinary surveillance of the domestic cat has provided
powerful models for studying infectious diseases relevant
to understanding human health and disease, including ret-
roviruses such as FeLV (37). Although future cross-species
transmission events among wild and domestic carnivore
populations may be unavoidable, our understanding of
pathogen and host genetic determinants may also be greatly
enhanced by the recent release of the genome sequence of
the domestic cat (38). Combining progress in biomedical
genomics with intensive studies of wild species can pro-
vide insights into emerging pathogens that affect wild, do-
mestic, and human hosts.
