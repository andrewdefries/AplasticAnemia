INTRODUCTION
Although allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT)
from HLA-identical siblings is the treatment of choice in pa-
tients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA), graft failure remains
one of the important, life-threatening complications following
allogeneic BMT in the patients. The graft failure rates after
HLA-identical sibling transplantations for SAA range from
5 to 50%, averaging about 10% (1, 2). The therapy for graft
failure includes the administration of human recombinant
growth factors (3-5) and the reinfusion of donor marrow (6-
10). Recently, infusion of allogeneic peripheral blood stem
cells (PBSC) mobilized by granulocyte-colony stimulating
factor (G-CSF) has been used in the patients (11-15). Allogene-
ic PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) has some advantages over
allogeneic BMT: general anesthesia is not required to collect
hematopoietic stem cells and faster hematologic recovery has
been reported (16, 17). However, there may be an increased
risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), since PBSC pro-
ducts collected by leukapheresis usually contain 10 to 100 times
more T lymphocytes than bone marrow grafts (18). Several
groups have shown that the incidence and the severity of acute
GVHD are similar between PBSCT and BMT (16, 17, 19).
However, it is presently unclear whether chronic GVHD occurs
more commonly after allogeneic PBSCT compared to BMT.
There are a few case reports with a short follow-up on the use
of allogeneic PBSCT for the rescue of graft failure after BMT
in SAA (12-14).
This paper reports the effect and outcome of allogeneic G-
CSF-mobilized PBSC rescue for late graft failure after BMT
in 7 patients with SAA, focusing on the sustained graft func-
tion and the development of the chronic GVHD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Twenty-five patients with SAA received transplants from
HLA-identical sibling donors at Chonnam National Univer-
sity Hospital between May 1991 and May 1999. The patient
characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median age
was 16 yr (range, 1 to 43 yr) for recipients and 15 yr (range,
3 to 40 yr) for their HLA-identical sibling donors. The medi-
an interval between diagnosis and BMT was 4 months (range,
1 to 61 months). The etiology of the aplastic anemia was idio-

Allogeneic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Rescue of Late Graft Failure
after Bone Marrow Transplantation in Patients with Aplastic Anemia
We investigated the effect and outcome of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
(PBSC) rescue for aplastic anemia (AA) patients with graft failure after allogene-
ic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Seven (28%) of 25 AA patients who
received BMT from HLA-identical sibling donors developed late graft failure at a
median of 7 months (range, 2.0-9.3 months) after transplantation. The patients
with graft failure were treated with PBSC collected from the original donor after
mobilization with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The median
boost dose of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 3.1×108
/kg (range, 1.4-
11.9×108
/kg). Median times to reach an absolute neutrophil count greater than
0.5×109
/L and a platelet count greater than 50×109
/L were 7 days (range, 4-14
days) and 9 days (range, 3-41 days), respectively. There was sustained graft
function in 6 of 7 patients, with a median follow-up duration of 3.3 yr (range, 1.0-
6.2 yr). Grade-I acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 2 patients,
while extensive chronic GVHD developed in 3 patients. This report shows that
G-CSF-mobilized allogeneic PBSC rescue is very effective in achieving com-
plete and sustained engraftment in patients with AA after graft failure. However,
more efficacious measures to prevent extensive chronic GVHD remain to be
developed.

pathic in 23 (92%) patients and Fanconi anemia in 2 (8%)
patients. Nineteen patients received pretransplant immunosup-
pressive treatment with cyclophosphamide (CY, 50 mg/kg
i.v.) for 4 days, ATG (Thymoglobulin, 1.25 mg/kg i.v.; Pasteur
Merieux, Lyon, France) for 3 days, and procarbazine (12.5 mg/
kg p.o.) for 3 days. Two patients received CY (50 mg/kg i.v.)
for 4 days and ATG (Atgam, 30 mg/kg i.v.; Upjohn, Kala-
mazoo, MI, U.S.A.) for 3 days. Four patients received CY (50
mg/kg i.v.) for 4 days and 6 Gy of total nodal irradiation (TNI).
The initial median marrow mononuclear cell (MNC) dose was
3.3×108
/kg(range,1.3-10.2×108
/kg).Post-transplantimmune
suppression to prevent GVHD consisted of methotrexate
(MTX) and cyclosporine (CsA) in all 25 patients. MTX was
given at a dose of 15 mg/m2
i.v. on day 1 and 10 mg/m2
i.v.
on day 3, 6 and 11. CsA was given at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day
i.v. on day -1 and then 3 mg/kg/day until oral dose was tol-
erated, continued for 1 yr. Doses were adjusted to maintain
a CsA plasma level between 200-400 g/mL.
Definition of engraftment and graft failure
Marrow engraftment was monitored by hematological cri-
teria. Engraftment was defined as the first day on which the
peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was ≥0.5×109
/
L for 2 consecutive days. Primary graft failure was defined as
patients who did not reach an ANC ≥0.5×109
/L for 3 con-
secutive days by day 28 after BMT. Late graft failure was de-
fined as patients who demonstrated evidence of initial engraft-
ment followed by development of an ANC <0.5×109
/L for
at least 14 days.
PBSC rescue
Five g/kg/day of recombinant human GM-CSF was tried
for three weeks in four of the seven patients to no avail. The
seven patients with late graft failure were treated with G-CSF-
mobilized PBSC transfusion from their original donors. In-
formed consent was obtained from the patients and donors.
Statistics
Statistical significance for variables affecting graft failure,
such as infused cell dose, the interval between diagnosis and
BMT, and age, was examined using the 2
test (Fisher’s exact
test). The Wilcoxon test was used to compare cell counts be-
fore and after PBSC boost.

RESULTS
Graft failure
Graft failure was seen in 7 of 25 patients for an overall rate
of 28%. No patients showed primary graft failure after initial
BMT. Marrow engraftment was initially documented in all
seven patients with a median time to reach an ANC ≥0.5
×109
/L of 18 days (range, 14-20), but later showed signs of
late graft failure, with a median interval of 7.0 months (range,
2.0-9.3 months) from the initial transplant.
A contingency table analysis was run for several variables
(Table 2). It showed that the infused MNC dose was a signif-
icant discriminant factor for developing graft failure. Infusion
of MNC <2.0×108
/kg carried an increased risk of graft fail-
ure. The mean infused MNC dose was lower in the graft fail-
ure group than in the non-graft failure group (2.6±0.9 vs.
4.2±1.9×108
/kg, p=0.048). Other variables, such as interval
between diagnosis and BMT, number of previous transfusions,
etiology, sex and age of the recipient, sex and age of the donor,
sex compatibility, ABO compatibility, and conditioning reg-
imen were not associated with graft failure. Although the rea-
sons for graft failure were not clear, potential risk factors for
graft failure were identified in six of these seven patients. Pa-
tient 002 received a low dose of marrow cells (1.3×108
/kg)
and transfusions from a family member before BMT. In Patient
012, graft failure was associated with hepatitis C infection
(20). In this case, the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
level rose abruptly to 821 IU/L on day 144, when the neu-
trophil and platelet counts began to dwindle. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) for HCV RNA and anti-HCV by ELISA
were positive. Serologic tests for viral hepatitis were negative
before BMT. Patients 025 and 033 received transfusions of
multiple blood products (43 and 46 units, respectively). Pa-
tients 026 and 094 received a low dose of marrow cells (1.7
and 1.8×108
/kg, respectively).
PBSC rescue
The median time from the initial transplantation to the
booster was 9.2 months (range, 2.9-14.3 months). The donor
for Patient 002 was treated with 5 g/kg G-CSF s.c. daily
for seven days and leukapheresis was done on day 8. The other
donors were treated with 10 g/kg G-CSF s.c. daily for 4 or
5 days and leukapheresis was done on one or two consecutive
days. The median dose of infused booster MNCs was 3.1×
108
/kg (range, 1.4-11.9×108
/kg). Patient 4 received 3.4×
106
/kg CD34+
cells separated from the pooled PBSC con-
centrate by the avidin-biotin technique (Ceprate SC, CellPro,
Bothell, U.S.A.).
At the time of PBSC rescue, complete donor chimerisms
were documented by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
with X-chromosome minisatellite probes in sex-disparate
pairs or PCR of DNA sequences with a variable number of
tandem repeats (VNTR). The patients did not receive any
additional conditioning for the booster, except Patient 002.
He received ALG (Lymphoglobulin, 10 mg/ kg/day i.v.; Pas-
teur Merieux, Lyon, France) for 5 days. As a GVHD prophy-
laxis, CsA was reinfused at 3 mg/kg/day in all the seven pa-
tients. Patients characteristics at the time of PBSC rescue are
summarized in Table 3.
Hematologic recovery
Rescue PBSC were engrafted in all seven patients engrafted
with median times of 7 days (range, 4-14) for ANC >0.5×
109
/L and 9 days (range, 3-41) for platelets >50×109
/L after
infusion. Hematologic recovery in the seven patients is shown
in Fig. 1. Platelet counts, ANC, and hemoglobin values were
significantly increased one month after the boost. Post-engraft-
ment boost produced sustained graft function in six of the
seven patients. Pancytopenia reappeared in only one patient
(Patient 026) who received selected CD34+
cells derived from
PBSC. At 3 months following rescue, his blood counts grad-

developedchronicGVHD with skin, oral, and hepatic involve-
ment on day 420, when she was off from CsA therapy. With
the onset of chronic GVHD, CsA plus steroid therapy was
started with a favorable response, and she is now doing well
without therapy at 39.5 months after boost. The remaining
four patients who did not develop chronic GVHD are alive

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated the effect and outcome of reinfu-
sion ofallogeneicG-CSF-mobilizedPBSCforrescueoflategraft
failure after BMT in seven patients with SAA. Graft failure
remains to be an important obstacle to the successful BMT
for patients with SAA. Factors that may contribute to graft
failure include prior blood transfusion (21), number of cells
infused (22), the type of immunosuppression used (1), T cell
depletion (1), and the degree of HLA disparity (23).The infused
MNC dose was a significant discriminant factor for develop-
ing graft failure in our patients. Although the reasons for graft
failure were not clear, potential risk factors for graft failure,
such as low dose of marrow cells, multiple prior blood transfu-
sions, transfusion of blood products from family, and hepatitis
C virus infection, were identified in six of seven patients. Con-
ditioning regimens including irradiation are less likely to be
followed by graft failure (7). In our patients, 7 of 21 patients
conditioned without irradiation developed graft failure, while
none of 4 patients conditioned with irradiation developed graft
failure. However, the conditioning regimen was not a discrim-
inating factor for developing graft failure (Table 2).
Therapeutic options after graft failure include a second mar-
row infusion, the use of hematopoietic growth factors, and
most recently allogeneic G-CSF-mobilized PBSC infusion.
Sierra et al. (4) reported their experience of 25 patients with
bone marrow failure after BMT who were treated with rhGM-
CSF. In that report, 10 of 11 patients with secondary graft
failure attained an ANC higher than 0.5×109
/L, but most
became severely neutropenic again at a median of 4 weeks. In
addition, no significant changes was observed in the transfu-
sion requirements for red cells or platelets during or after
rhGM-CSF. In four of our seven patients, rhGM-CSF at 5 g/
kg/day was tried for three weeks to no avail.
A second marrow transplant from the same donor, or from
another HLA-identical sibling if available, is an widely accept-
ed approach. Reinfusion of marrow can be an effective inter-
vention in achieving second engraftment in graft failure pa-
tients, but survival is limited because of high mortality from
infection (6, 7).
Recent attention has been focused on the use of PBSC for
allogeneic transplantation in this setting. Several reports have
confirmed the feasibility of allogeneic transplants employing
PBSC (16-18). The first report of graft failure treatment by
Dreger et al. (11) strongly suggested that a boost with allo-
geneic PBSC could restore bone marrow function. Other gr-
oups successfully reversed graft failure with CD34-selected
PBSCT (24, 25). Gurman et al. (13) firstly reported allogene-
ic PBSCT as a second transplantation for late graft failure in
SAA. Rapid, sustained engraftment, along with the presence
of mostly donor-type CD3+ lymphocytes in the peripheral
blood after G-CSF mobilized PBSCT, implies that a large
number of donor T cells can surpass the residual host T cells,
even without a prior conditioning regimen (26). Redei et al.
(14) reported the first case of allogeneic PBSCT without prior
reconditioning for the treatment of primary graft failure fol-
lowing BMT for SAA.
The issue of reconditioning before second marrow or blood
cell infusion for graft failure is controversial. Champlin et al.
(1) reported that survival in aplastic anemia patients treated
with a second bone marrow infusion was not significantly
influenced by the use of reconditioning regimen. McCann
et al. (7) reported that patients conditioned with irradiation
before second BMT had better survival, but it did not reach
statistical significance. In a study of patients with primary
graft failure who received either no reconditioning or only
increased immunosuppression before a second marrow infu-
sion, Davies et al. (6) reported that 8 of 12 (66%) patients
achieved engraftment and 4 survived. In contrast, only 4 of
9 (44%) patients who received chemotherapy with or with-
out irradiation as reconditioning experienced engraftment
and none of them survived. Therefore, the role of recondi-
tioning remains to be controversial. The potential benefit of
potent immunosuppression to counteract immune-mediat-
ed graft failure might be offset by the high risk of infection,
which may contribute to fatal outcome. Chimeric status at
the time of graft failure is of value in considering recondi-
tioning before the second transplantation. Mixed chimerism
per se is not always an indicator of impending graft failure,
and the degree of mixed chimerism may be the deciding
factor for the graft failure (27, 28). In our patients, complete
donor chimerism was documented in all the patients at the
time of PBSC rescue. All but one were treated with allogene-
ic PBSCs without immunosuppression, thereby avoiding
the risk of reconditioning.
Potential disadvantages of allogeneic PBSCT include the
theoretical increased risk of GVHD, due to the presence of
approximately 10 to 100 times more T lymphocytes in the
leukapheresis products than in bone marrow (18). Unexpect-
edly, however, the incidence and severity of acute GVHD was
not increased in PBSCT (16, 17). In our study, no patients
developed grade II-IV acute GVHD after reinfusion of donor
cells. The incidence of chronic GVHD after allogeneic PBSCT
is still controversial. A tendency toward an increased incidence
of chronic GVHD has been reported in some studies (29-31),
while other investigators report comparable incidence of chron-
ic GVHD after PBSCT (16, 32, 33). Follow-up duration was
too short to accurately assess the incidence of chronic GVHD
in most studies (16, 32, 33). In addition, most studies com-
pared retrospective control BMT data with the PBSCT fig-
ures. In our study, three of seven (42.9%) patients developed
extensive chronic GVHD. This incidence is similar to that
reported by Anderlini et al. (30) and less than that reported
by Majolino et al. (29) However, it is significantly higher than
that observed in 17 SAA patients who survived for at least
472 I.-J. Chung, J.-J. Lee, M.-R. Park, et al.
100 days and did not show graft failure after BMT in this
study (43% vs. 5.9%; p=0.027). The BMT group received
CsA and short-course MTX, but the PBSC boost group re-
ceived only CsA for GVHD prevention. However, this differ-
ence in GVHD prophylaxis does not seem to be directly asso-
ciated with the difference in the incidence of extensive chron-
ic GVHD. Levine et al. (34) reported that there was no sta-
tistically significant difference in the probability of develop-
ing chronic GVHD between patients who received MTX as
part of GVHD prophylaxis and those who did not receive
MTX. There is no advantage associated with the development
of chronic GVHD in SAA; thus, the development of more
effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of chron-
ic GVHD, such as the addition of steroids or partial T cell
depletion, is to be considered, although chronic GVHD was
not associated with transplant-related mortality in this study.
Hematopoietic recovery after PBSC boost was successful
in the majority of patients. Post-engraftment boost showed
sustained graft function in six of seven patients. All seven
patients, including one who received a third transplant for
recurrent pancytopenia after PBSC boost, survived with a
median follow-up of 3.3 yr (range, 1.0-6.2 yr).
This report suggests that G-CSF-mobilized allogeneic
PBSC rescue is successful in achieving complete, sustained
engraftment after graft failure in patients with SAA. But as
the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD is higher than that
following BMT, more efficacious measures to prevent exten-
sive chronic GVHD should be developed.
