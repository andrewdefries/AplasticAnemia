Abstract
Background: Under the current healthcare system in China, there is no government-sponsored
health insurance program for children. Children from families who move from rural and interior
regions to large urban centres without a valid residency permit might be at higher risk of being
uninsured due to their low socioeconomic status. We conducted a survey in Shanghai to describe
children's health insurance coverage according to their migration status.
Method: Between 2005 and 2006, we conducted an in-person health survey of the adult care-
givers of children aged 7 and under, residing in five districts of Shanghai. We compared uninsurance
rates between temporary and permanent child residents, and investigated factors associated with
child health uninsurance.
Results: Even though cooperative insurance eligibility has been extended to temporary residents
of Shanghai, the uninsurance rate was significantly higher among temporary (65.6%) than permanent
child residents (21.1%, adjusted odds ratio (OR): 5.85, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 4.62–
7.41). For both groups, family income was associated with having child health insurance; children in
lower income families were more likely to be uninsured (OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.40–2.96).
Conclusion: Children must rely on their parents to make the insurance purchase decision, which
is constrained by their income and the perceived benefits of the insurance program. Children from
migrant families are at even higher risk for uninsurance due to their lower socioeconomic status.
Government initiatives specifically targeting temporary residents and providing health insurance
benefits for their children are urgently needed.
Background
In China, the 'hukou' system, a system of residency per-
mits dating back to the 1950s which identified a person as
an area resident according to the household registration
record, formerly imposed strict controls on migration. The
'hukou' system effectively minimized a person's mobility
by tying various opportunities and social benefits (includ-
ing employment, housing, healthcare, and children's edu-
cation) with her/his official place of residence [1]. Starting
in the 1980s, China went through major market reforms
and fast economic growth. Such growth was largely unbal-
anced, not only between urban and rural areas, but also

among different regions. On the one hand, reforms in
urban areas, including development of a contract labour
system, created a large demand for rural migrants. On the
other hand, agricultural market reforms produced a large
surplus labour supply. More importantly, the emerging
private markets for housing and employment opened new
opportunities for social mobility [2]. As a result, it created
a huge new "floating population", i.e., people who
migrated from rural to urban areas, from underdeveloped
to developed regions, and from central and western to
eastern coastal areas. In 2003, China's floating population
reached 140 million, accounting for 10 per cent of the
total population and about 30 per cent of the rural labour
force [3].
Unlike permanent residents, these migrants and their chil-
dren (i.e., temporary residents) do not have residency per-
mits, and are not eligible for various social benefits that
are tied to residency, for example, their children can only
attend designated schools. Thus, their social and eco-
nomic status is similar to those of illegal immigrants [4].
Furthermore, temporary residents may be at increased risk
of poor health because of the physical and psychological
stresses involved in migration, resettlement and adapta-
tion to a new community and a new life. Their health
needs may not be met due to financial barriers in access-
ing the healthcare system. The consequences of these
problems may be particularly pronounced for children.
Concurrent with its economic upheaval, China's health-
care system went through a series of reforms, changing
from the previous centrally-planned and universal health-
care system to a heavily market-based one [5]. Under the
new system, there are strong economic incentives for
healthcare providers to engage in competition, waiting
lists have been largely eliminated, and for those who can
afford to pay, the quality and choice of care have
improved significantly. During this period, China's
national health expenditures increased from 110.2 hun-
dred million Chinese RMB (renminbi) in 1978 to 7590.3
hundred million Chinese RMB in 2004 [6]. Despite such
a dramatic increase in healthcare costs, children are no
longer covered under public insurance.
In the urban areas, prior to healthcare reform, two types
of public health insurance programs (Labor Health Insur-
ance and Government Health Insurance programs) cov-
ered the majority of residents, including dependent
children. After the reform, these programs were replaced
by a new urban employee health insurance program. This
new public insurance program provides insurance cover-
age to all enterprise employees only; their dependent chil-
dren are no longer covered [6]. In the rural areas, all
residents were previously covered by the Cooperative
Medical Scheme (CMS), a form of collective economy pre-
paid health security program. After the reform, the old
CMS literally collapsed. Rural healthcare, for both adults
and children, has reverted primarily to private financing
(self-pay) [7]. In recent years, the Chinese government has
been implementing various forms of new CMS pilot
projects all over the country, aiming to re-establish CMS
in the rural areas and increase insurance coverage among
the rural population [8,9]. This new CMS provides limited
coverage to families who enrol, including their children.
In addition, starting in the early 1980s, private (or com-
mercial) health insurance plans, offered by life insurance
companies, were introduced in both urban and rural
areas. The development of the private health insurance
market in China is still at a very preliminary stage. Accord-
ing to the Third National Health Survey in China, only 5.6
per cent of the population was covered by commercial
health insurance [10].
In summary, under the current healthcare system, chil-
dren in both urban and rural areas, particularly those of
migrant families, have become one of the most vulnerable
populations in China in terms of healthcare access. Unin-
surance among children has long been attracting attention
from health policy makers and researchers in developed
countries such as the US [11]. Existing literature has indi-
cated that children with insurance are more likely to have
a usual source of care [12-14], to have access to preventive
care [15,16], to get the healthcare services they need [17],
to have improved social and emotional development
[18], and to be better equipped to do well in school,
which leads to higher productivity in the future [19,20].
As a result, the State Children's Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP) was designed and implemented largely to
expand health insurance coverage for children in the US
[21,22]. Furthermore, immigrants in the US have been
found to more likely to be uninsured than U.S.-born pop-
ulations and have been identified as a vulnerable popula-
tion [23-26].
Reducing disparities and better protecting vulnerable pop-
ulations has become one of the Chinese government's
biggest challenges. Recognizing the magnitude and conse-
quences of low insurance coverage for children, the gov-
ernment is seeking solutions in not-for-profit cooperative
insurance programs. Shanghai is one of the few cities in
China that offer such a program. Shanghai Children Hos-
pital Care Aid (SCHCA) was established in 1999 under
the joint efforts of the Shanghai Red Cross, Shanghai Edu-
cation Commission, and Shanghai Bureau of Health, and
was intended to offer hospital coverage for children at a
low premium. The SCHCA premium is currently set at 60
Chinese RMB (about 8 US dollars) per year for age 0–5; 50
Chinese RMB per year for age 6–18. (As a reference point,
the average annual household income in Shanghai in
2006 was 20,668 Chinese RMB [27]) In China, one has to

pay a significant deposit at admission in order to be hos-
pitalized. Enrolees of SCHCA, when hospitalized in desig-
nated hospitals, only pay 50 per cent of this deposit. Upon
discharge, 50 per cent of the total medical expense above
the deductible is also covered (depending on the type of
hospital, the deductible ranges from 100 to 300 Chinese
RMB). In addition, SCHCA covers 50 per cent of the fees
for specialist outpatient visits after hospital discharge for
leukemia, hemophilia, aplastic anemia, and cancer, as
well as the cost of renal dialysis prior to transplant, and
the cost of anti-rejection drugs after the surgery. SCHCA
was initially offered only to permanent child residents in
Shanghai. As of September 1st 2004, children who were
born between September 1st, 1998 and August 7th, 2003
to temporary residents are also eligible to enrol [28].
Do disparities exist between permanent and temporary
residents in terms of child health insurance coverage?
How effective is SCHCA in terms of expanding child
health insurance coverage among both permanent and
temporary residents in Shanghai? What are the determi-
nants of families' decisions to purchase child health insur-
ance? In order to shed light on these important questions,
we conducted an in-person survey of the parents or guard-
ians of temporary and permanent child residents (age 7 or
younger) in five districts in Shanghai. Using this unique
child health survey data, we described and compared
uninsurance rates of temporary and permanent child resi-
dents in Shanghai, where both public and private insur-
ance are available. We investigated factors associated with
child health uninsurance and identified subgroups of
temporary child residents who are at high risk of uninsur-
ance.
Method
Study population: The Shanghai Child Residents Health
Survey
We conducted a survey of children aged 7 or younger from
2005 to 2006 in Shanghai. Five out of the 19 districts in
Metropolitan Shanghai were included in the survey:
Baoshan, Hongkou, Zhabei, Minhang and Changning.
These districts were selected because they have the highest
densities of temporary residents in Shanghai. Although
these districts are not randomly selected from all districts
in the Shanghai metropolitan area, they are representative
in the following way: Changning is a high income inner-
city district; Hongkou and Zhabei are lower income inner-
city districts; Baoshan and Minhang are suburban districts
with a large number of temporary residents.
The sample in this survey was randomly selected from
children going for regular checkups at community child
health clinics and those attending day care centres. (It is
far less feasible to reach families, especially temporary res-
idents, who do not bring their children for checkups or
send their children to day care centres.) Within each dis-
trict, both temporary and permanent child residents in the
child health clinics and day care centres were clustered by
seven age groups (age 0–1, 1–2, ...., 6–7) and by sex. Chil-
dren who were younger than three were recruited from
community child health clinics; those who were older
than three were recruited from day care centres. Within
each cluster, a sample of 15 children was collected. Partic-
ipants were randomly selected as people arrived at the
child health clinics or day care centres; parents or guardi-
ans were surveyed until the quota of 15 children was
reached for each cluster. This resulted in about 2,000
households in our sample.
The survey was conducted by teams in each district con-
sisting of two to three pediatricians and children's health-
care nurses who work in the community child health
clinics. Before the survey, all interviewers were trained by
the principal investigator (Jing Zhang) who designed and
tested this survey. Interviewers visited child health clinics
and day care centers to conduct the survey. Ethics
approval for this study was obtained from Shanghai Jiao-
tong University. Interviewers explained the purposes and
confidentiality of the survey, and then invited parents or
guardians of the children to participate in the survey.
Respondents could choose not to participate; their partic-
ipation in the survey was accepted as oral consent. The
survey response rate was over 90 per cent. The complete-
ness of questionnaires was checked by a district survey
manager at the end of every day. If there was missing
information on the survey, individuals would be tele-
phoned and resurveyed if possible. The questionnaires
were then submitted to and reviewed by the principal
investigator.
Dependent Variable: Child Health Insurance
Children in Shanghai may hold three types of health
insurance: SCHCA, CMS, or private insurance. As
described earlier, there is no universal public insurance for
children in China. SCHCA is one of the first few coopera-
tive insurance programs offered to children. It was offered
initially to permanent child residents only and subse-
quently extended to all child residents in Shanghai. For
migrant residents coming from rural areas, a small
number of families hold some form of CMS, which pro-
vides insurance coverage to both adults and children.
Other than these two forms of cooperative public insur-
ance, the third insurance option for children is private
insurance.
Independent Variables
There is a large literature in health economics studying
what are the factors affecting people's decisions of pur-
chasing health insurance. Individual and household
social-economic factors, such as age, sex, education,
BMC Health Services Research 2008, 8:238 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/8/238

employment, income and family structure, are found to
be important determinants of health insurance [29,30].
The actual or perceived health status of an individual, a
predictor of expected healthcare expenditure, is also
found to be associated with the decision to purchase
health insurance [31-33]. Similarly, expected healthcare
expenditure is another predictor of the health insurance
purchase decision [34]. How individuals perceive risk is
also found to be an important factor [35]. Following the
existing literature, we included both individual and
household characteristics as independent variables in our
model.
Child characteristics
The survey collected information on the child's age, sex,
and health status. An ordinal variable was created to indi-
cate whether a child's age was 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, ... or 6–7.
There are three measures of child health status: 1) the
child's overall growth as assessed by the parent (three cat-
egories: "good", "fair" and "poor"); 2) whether the child
had an illness in the previous two weeks for which a doc-
tor was seen; and 3) whether the child was hospitalized
during the past year.
Household Characteristics
We include in all our models household monthly income,
mother's education, mother's occupation, father's educa-
tion, father's occupation, family size, and parents' opin-
ion on health insurance price. For monthly household
income, respondents were asked to choose from the fol-
lowing six categories: < 500 Chinese RMB a month, 500 to
1,000 RMB, 1,000 to 3,000 RMB, 3,000 to 6,000 RMB,
6,000 to 10,000 RMB, and above 10,000 RMB. We
regrouped this variable into three categories: low income
(below 3000 Chinese RMB), middle income (between
3000 and 6000 Chinese RMB, and high income (above
6000 Chinese RMB) (average monthly household income
in Shanghai was around 3000 Chinese RMB in 2003; 1
Chinese RMB = 0.13 U.S. dollars.) The child's family size
included living with parents only, with both parents and
grandparents, a single-parent family, or others. Given that
the per centage of single-parent families is very low in our
sample (less than 1 per cent), we redefined this variable
into two categories: child living with parents only or not.
To shed light on public opinion about health insurance
cost, our survey asked the parents whether they thought
health insurance was "too expensive, acceptable, or don't
care".
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were employed to illustrate the child
and parent characteristics of the study population; the
characteristics included sociodemographic characteristics,
child health status, and family structure. We tested these
characteristics for statistical differences between perma-
nent and migrant residents. Frequencies of variables in the
survey were not weighted because sampling weights were
not available. Finally, a binary logistic model was used to
analyze an individual household's choice between having
no child health insurance and having child health insur-
ance. Stepwise regression was used to select model predic-
tors.
Results
Descriptive results
We excluded 7 duplicate observations and those with
missing data, resulting in a valid sample size of 1,907 chil-
dren. Table 1 presents the characteristics of both children
and parents in our study population. Among the 1907
households in our survey, 960 were temporary residents
and 947 were permanent residents. The mean age of chil-
dren in the survey was 3.4 years.
More permanent than temporary child residents were
assessed by their parents as having good growth (56.2%
versus 47.7%, p < 0.001), were sick during the last two
week (21.2% versus 15.4%, p < 0.001), or were hospital-
ized (3.5% versus 2.7%, p < 0.001). Many more tempo-
rary residents fell into the low income category (53.1%
versus 27.2%, p < 0.001).
For both parents, the education level of temporary resi-
dents was much lower than of permanent residents:
10.2% of the mothers who were temporary residents had
only an elementary school education (versus 0.5%, p <
0.001), and only 11.3% attended college and above (ver-
sus 51.6%, p < 0.001); similar contrasts existed for the
fathers' education. There was also a large difference in
mother's and father's occupation. Among temporary resi-
dents, both mothers and fathers were less likely than their
permanent resident counterparts to be labourers (15.5%
versus 22.3% for mothers; 24.9% versus 29.5% for
fathers; p < 0.001), officials and professionals (7.0% ver-
sus 28.1% for mothers; 12.5% versus 28.9% for fathers; p
< 0.001); more likely to be in sales and trade related busi-
ness (42.1% versus 33.1% for mothers; 60.6% versus
38.6% for fathers; p < 0.001); and more likely to be unem-
ployed (mothers only: 35.4% versus 16.6%; p < 0.001).
Temporary child residents were more likely to be living in
a three-person only family compared with permanent
child residents (66.8% vs. 54.6%, p < 0.001).
Child health insurance coverage
The overall insurance rate in our sample was 56.5%. The
insurance rate was much higher among permanent child
residents, reaching 78.9%, compared with the 34.4%
insurance rate among temporary child residents (see Table
2). Among the permanent child residents who had health
insurance, 56.5% had SCHCA, and 36.8% had private
insurance. Among the temporary residents, 22.4% had

SCHCA, 0.3% had CMS, and 70.3% had private insur-
ance.
Parents' opinions on the cost of health insurance are sum-
marized in Table 3. Among the uninsured population,
there is no significant difference between permanent and
temporary residents in terms of views on the price of
health insurance. Among those who are insured, perma-
nent residents were more likely to find the price of health
insurance acceptable than temporary residents. Among
both the uninsured and insured populations, there is a
significantly higher percentage of temporary residents
who answered that they "don't care". This indicates that
child health insurance is a lower priority for temporary
residents.
Risk adjusted analysis results
Consistent with the descriptive results, after controlling
for child and parent characteristics, temporary child resi-
dents were significantly more likely to be uninsured com-
pared with permanent child residents (odds ratio: 5.85,
95% confidence interval: 4.62–7.41, See Table 4). The
older a child was, the less likely the child was uninsured.
Illness within the last two weeks requiring a doctor's visit
was significantly associated with having insurance. Chil-
dren from the lowest income families were less likely to be
insured. Lower education in both the mother and the
father was found to be significantly associated with child
uninsurance. Children living with parents only were more
likely to be uninsured than those who live with parents
and grandparents. This is likely due to the fact that grand-
parents bring in an additional source of family income
and increase the family's ability to purchase health insur-
ance. Other variables, such as gender, health status meas-
ured by growth, mother and father's occupation, or
opinion about price of health insurance were not found to
be significantly correlated with having child insurance.
We also calculated an adjusted odds ratio for the likeli-
hood of take-up of SCHCA among residents who hold
either SCHCA or private insurance. The result indicates
that compared with permanent residents, temporary resi-
dents are less likely to enrol their children in SCHCA and
more likely to buy private insurance (odds ratio: 0.24,
95% confidence interval: 0.17, 0.33). This is consistent
with the descriptive results presented in Table 2. As stated
earlier, up until 2004, only children who were permanent
residents in Shanghai were eligible to enrol in SCHCA.
The only option for temporary residents was to purchase
private insurance. Since 2004, SCHCA has extended its
coverage to children who are temporary residents. How-
ever, this information has not been delivered effectively to
temporary residents; many temporary residents are still
not aware of this benefit.
To test how robust our results are, we used different model
specifications (results not presented but available upon
request). Interaction terms between being a temporary
child resident and variables such as family income,
mother's and father's education were included in the
models. However, the interaction terms were not statisti-
cally significant and the above main results in Table 4
remained robust.
Discussion
Our study demonstrated that temporary child residents
were more likely to be uninsured than permanent child
residents in Shanghai. Regardless of their resident status,
most of them are not covered under the public health
insurance system, making them one of the largest vulner-
able populations. Despite the low premium and extended
eligibility of SCHCA, the uninsurance rate is still high
among both permanent (21.1%) and temporary child res-
idents (65.6%) in our survey sample. This presents a seri-
ous concern on the effectiveness of cooperative insurance,
such as SCHCA, in eliminating uninsurance among chil-

dren. One likely reason is SCHCA's high coinsurance rate;
even with SCHCA, the child's family still needs to pay a
significant part of the total cost. This is consistent with the
existing literature on immigrant status and health insur-
ance.
For both temporary and permanent residents, child health
status (measured by illness within the last two weeks
requiring a doctor's visit), family income, mother and
father's education level are found to be significantly asso-
ciated with the decision to purchase child health insur-
ance: those with better health status, and those in lower
income or lower education families are more likely to be
uninsured. This is consistent with the existing literature
on determinants of health insurance [36-39].
We also found that even with SCHCA eligibility extended
to temporary residents in Shanghai, temporary child resi-
dents are still significantly more likely to be uninsured
compared with permanent child residents. There are sev-
eral possible barriers to health insurance coverage for tem-
porary residents. The first one is affordability: temporary
residents tend to have lower household incomes than per-
manent residents. The second one is perceived benefit.
Temporary residents may be more uncertain about their
future need for healthcare in the local healthcare system,
and therefore more reluctant to purchase health insur-
ance. The third one is a knowledge issue. With less social
support, temporary residents may be less informed about
the insurance options available. Lastly, temporary resi-
dents tend to be more risk-taking than permanent resi-
dents, and thus may be more likely to think their children
do not need to have health insurance. In addition, we
found that among those who decided to insure their chil-
dren, temporary residents are much less likely than per-
manent residents to choose SCHCA and more likely to
purchase private insurance.
Our results call for stronger government support of child
health insurance programs. The policy implications from
our study are three-fold. First, one of the factors responsi-
ble for low participation in SCHCA among temporary res-
idents is poor outreach. Campaigns to increase temporary
residents' awareness of existing child health insurance
programs and their benefits should be launched. Second,
government initiatives specifically targeting temporary
residents and providing health insurance benefits for their
children are urgently needed. Currently, the Chinese gov-
ernment is starting to establish new basic health insurance
programs for urban residents including their dependent
children. Premiums in these programs are paid jointly by
the government, the parents' employer, and the parents.
Similar basic insurance programs for temporary residents
should also be introduced. Third, there is no law on child
health insurance in China. Government legislation is
needed to protect children's health.
This study has several limitations. Due to difficulties in
reaching temporary residents who are of low socioeco-
nomics status (e.g., construction workers), our survey
over-sampled temporary residents who were relatively
well educated and had higher incomes. Second, our sur-
vey was conducted in the Shanghai metropolitan area,
which is one of the most affluent cities and provides one
of the best job markets for migrants in China. Only fami-
lies of children who went to child health clinics for regular
checkups and/or those who attended child care centers
were sampled. In other words, the actual uninsurance
rates and the gap in child insurance between temporary
and permanent residents in Shanghai could be much
larger than our estimates. Furthermore, these findings
could be even more pronounced in other less developed
regions in China. In addition, measures of child health
status in this study are self-reported and are subject to
reporting error. We were not able to assess whether health
insurance has improved healthcare access and child
health due to lack of data on health services utilization
and health outcomes. Our survey did not incorporate

instruments to measure and compare quality of care
between insured and un-insured children. These limita-
tions in both survey method and content should be
addressed in future survey design to allow us to further
tackle the questions around health insurance, access, uti-
lization, and outcomes among children in China.
Conclusion
Investing in children's health coverage is a cost effective
way to improve population health and social welfare.
Children rely on their parents to make the insurance pur-
chase decision, which is limited by their income and the
perceived benefits of the insurance program. Children
from migrant families are at even larger risk for uninsur-
ance due to their social and economic status. Our findings
will help health policy makers' understanding of the mag-
nitude of health uninsurance in children, and the dispari-
ties in coverage between permanent and temporary child
residents in China. Our study sheds light on how to
reduce such disparities and improve healthcare for vulner-
able children.
