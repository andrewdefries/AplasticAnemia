Background: Fulminant hepatitis and biliary atresia are serious problems and their causes have not been ex-
plained well. We investigated whether or not erythrovirus B19 is a candidate etiologic agent in such liver disease
patients who had undergone liver transplantation.
Methods: Liver tissues from 47 patients consisted of 28 fulminant hepatitis and 19 biliary atresia were examined
to detect B19 genes by PCR and further analyzed their genomic characterization.
Results: B19 DNA was detected by nested PCR in 10 of 28 cases (35.7%) livers in the fulminant hepatitis group
and 7 of 19 (36.8%) livers in the biliary atresia group, respectively (statistically not significant). Importantly,
among the 8 hepatic B19 DNA-positive patients who had paired samples of liver and serum, the serum B19 ge-
nome was detectable in only one case. B19 mRNA was identified in all of 10 fulminant hepatitis cases with he-
patic B19 DNA, but only 1 out of 7 (14.3%) cases in biliary atresia tested. Furthermore, we obtained ten isolates
having the B19 genome with nearly full-length sequences. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis based on the NS1
gene revealed three different clusters: two for isolates from fulminant hepatitis and the other for isolates from
biliary atresia.
Conclusions: Our results presented here suggested that B19 may be an etiologic agent of fulminant hepatitis.
Key words: Erythrovirus B19; erythrovirus B19 genome; fulminant hepatitis; biliary atresia; liver transplantation
1. Introduction
Erythrovirus (formally parvovirus) B19 (B19)
causes a wide range of diseases in humans. B19 is a
currently the only accepted member of the Erythrovi-
rus genus and the only erythrovirus known to be
pathogenic in humans. Several workers reported cases
of children with fulminant or acute hepatitis with
acute B19 infection and suggested that B19 could be
the cause of the hepatitis [1-3]. Their diagnosis was
based on the detection of the serum B19 DNA by PCR
assay. However, the cause of fulminant hepatitis and
biliary atresia in many patients is unexplained and
this is a serious issue, especially in newborns and in-
fants. More than 80% of these cases ultimately require
liver transplantation or die of hepatic failure. B19 has
been proposed as the cause of the fulminant hepatic
failure in patients with or without aplastic anemia, on
the basis of the presence of B19 DNA in liver speci-
mens. However, the mechanism of liver damage by
B19 infection remains conjectural. An immunologi-
cally-mediated mechanism of B19-induced hepatocyte
destruction has been postulated, but not documented.
Thus, there could be an unsuspected cofactor that is
associated with B19 infection and is deleterious to the
liver. To address these important issues, we conducted
a molecular characterization of B19 genomes isolated
from patients with fulminant hepatitis and biliary
atresia.
2. Materials and Methods
Patients: We compared 2 different groups con-
sisted with 47 Japanese patients (aged from newborns
to 66 years old; 24 males and 23 females). Group A
consisted of 28 patients with fulminant hepatitis (14
males and 14 females; 9 infants less than one year old,
8 children 1-10 years old, 3 adolescents 11-20 years old
and 8 adults over 21 years old). On the other hand,
group B consisted of 19 patients with biliary atresia; 7
males and 12 females; 4 infants less than one year old,
10 children 1-10 years old, 4 adolescents 11-20 years
old and one adult over 21 years old). All patients ex-
Int. J. Med. Sci. 2007, 4 106
amined had no evidence of hepatitis virus infections
and diagnosed as non-B, non-C hepatitis. Most of the
patients tested underwent living-donor liver trans-
plantation at Kyoto University Hospital from 1994 to
2000. Majority of patients had history of blood trans-
fusion or blood product infusion in their course of
treatment. The liver tissues and serum samples from
recipients obtained at operation stored at -80°C until
used. Informed consent for participation in this study
was obtained from each individual.
Nucleic acid extraction, PCR and sequencing
analysis: Nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) were extracted
from frozen liver tissues and serum using SepaGene
RV-R Kit (Sanko-Junyaku, Tokyo, Japan). The result-
ing pellet was resuspended in 100 µl RNase-free water,
following the manufacturer’s instruction. B19 DNA
was screened by nested PCR using primers designed
from VP1 region; PV1 (sense, 5’-GCT GTT AAG GAT
GTT ACA GA-3’, nucleotide (nt) 3520-3521) and PV1R
(antisense, 5’-GGA TCC GTA TAA GGG ATT GT-3’,
nt 3882-3901) for the 1st PCR and PV2 (sense, 5’-CAG
GTT ACT GAC AGC ACT AC-3’, nt 3541-3560) and
PV2R (antisense, 5’-TGT TGA CTG CAG CCC TCT
AA-3’, nt 3848-3867) for the 2nd PCR (Yoto et al., 1996).
The sensitivity of this PCR assay allowed detection of
as few as 10 copies of B19 genome. In addition, we
sequenced the B19 isolates consisted of 4561 bp cov-
ering NS1, VP1 and VP2 regions obtained from liver
tissues of patients. For this purpose, three overlapping
PCR products (fragments A to C) were generated; for
fragment A (1944 bp), PV3 (sense, 5'-TTT CCC GCC
TTA TGC AAA TGG GCA G-3', nt 393-417) and PV5R
(antisense, 5’-AGC TCC CAC ATG GCA GCT AC-3’,
nt 2533-2552) for the 1st PCR and PV4 (sense, 5'-TGT
AAC GGT TAA AAT GGG CGG AGC G-3', nt 457-481)
and PV6R (antisense, 5'- CCC CTT ACA CCG TCC
CAC AC-3', nt 2382-2401) for the 2nd PCR; for frag-
ment B (1835 bp), PV5 (sense, 5'-GCA GCA GTG GTG
GTG AAA GC-3', nt 2143-2162) and PV1R for the 1st
PCR and PV6 (sense, 5'-GGC GCC TGG AAC ACT
GAA AC-3', nt 2208-2227) and PV2R for the 2nd PCR;
for fragment C (1297 bp), PV1 and PV3R (sense,
5'-TAC AGT CTG GGT GGT ACT GGT GGG C-3', nt
5010-5034) for the 1st PCR and PV2 and PV4R (an-
tisense, 5'-CTG GTG GGC GTT TAG TTA CGC ATC
C-3', nt 4994-5018). Nucleotide positions are based on
B19-HV isolate (accession No. AF162273). The PCR
was done with AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin Elmer, Nor-
walk, Conn.) and Blend-Taq-Plus DNA polymerase
(TOYOBO Co., Tokyo, Japan). The amplicons were
separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and puri-
fied using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.,
Chatsworth, Calif.). Recovered amplicons were sub-
jected to direct sequencing from both directions using
the ABI PRISMTM Big Dye Terminator Cycle Se-
quencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin Elmer). Se-
quences of amplified DNA were determined using a
sequencer (ABI model 373A; Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, Calif.). Additionally, hepatitis A, B, C and
E genomes were also determined by the nested PCR.
Detection of B19 mRNA: The purified RNA ob-
tained from liver tissues as described above, was di-
gested by RQ I DNase (Promega Co., Madison, Wis.)
to remove any DNA. B19 cDNA was synthesized from
the pretreated RNA by reaction with 100 units of
Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase
(Promega Co.) and PV1R antisense primer. The cDNA
obtained was subjected to nested PCR amplification.
Phylogenetic analysis: Characterization of B19
isolates was examined by the phylogenetic analysis as
described previously [4]. The data were analyzed us-
ing a standard statistical software package (Stat View;
Brain Power Inc., Calabases, CA, U.S.A.).
Statistic analyses: Statistic analyses were per-
formed by the chi-square test. A difference with a P
value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
3. Results
B19 DNA in liver tissues was detected in 10 of 28
(35.7%) patients with fulminant hepatitis and 7 of 19
(36.8%) patients with BA, respectively (statistically not
significant). Except for two infants with fulminant
hepatitis who were HBV DNA-positive, all cases
tested were negative for HAV RNA, HCV RNA and
HEV RNA. Importantly, among the hepatic B19
DNA-positive 8 patients who had paired samples of
liver tissues and serum, the serum B19 sequence was
detectable in only one case (Table 1).
Table 1. Comparison of B19 DNA detection between serum
and liver tissue
To determine the form of viral replication, the
presence of B19 mRNA in the liver tissue was exam-
ined. The results showed that B19 mRNA was present
in all cases with fulminant hepatitis to be hepatic
B19-positive, but only 1 of 7 (14.3%) cases in biliary
atresia tested. Amplification of B19 DNA did not take
place in the absence of reverse transcriptase, indicat-
ing minimal DNA contamination.
In addition to the above-described examinations,
to characterize the B19 genomes, we obtained 14 iso-
lates of the B19 genome (10 isolates with nearly
full-length sequences (4561 bp) that covered the com-
plete genes of NS1, VP1 and VP2 and 4 isolates with
only one short sequence in the NS1). All B19 isolates
showed an overall identity of 98% at the nt level
among each isolate with 4561 bp recovered in this
study and to prototypes of B19 HV (F162273) and B19
Int. J. Med. Sci. 2007, 4 107
Au (M13178), and an identity of 87% to
the B19 V9 isolate (AY083234). Interest-
ingly, phylogenetic analysis based on the
NS1 gene revealed three different clus-
ters: two (genotypes 1 and 3) for isolates
from fulminant hepatitis and the other
(genotype 2) for isolates from biliary
atresia (Fig. 1). Among each genotype,
specific sites of the deduced amino acid
sequence change were identified in the
NS1 gene (Fig. 2). In 7 isolates belonging
to group 2, the amino acid at position 181
and 201 showed methionine and aspartic
acid, respectively. Interestingly, aspartic
acid substitution in 201 localized within
the putative B cell epitope. Furthermore,
in 5 out of 6 isolates belonging to group 3,
the amino acid at position 183 substi-
tuted to alanine.

4. Discussion
The etiology of hepatitis remains obscure in
3-10% of cases in Europe [5] and the United States [6]
and up to 30% of cases in Asia [7, 8]. Particularly, the
cause of fulminant hepatitis in children is unexplained
in up to 50% of cases in our hospital. Once
well-known hepatotropic agents and metabolic, toxic,
and immunological causes have been excluded, an
infectious origin remains a possibility. Opportunistic
infections may be the cause of fulminant hepatitis in
immunocompromised patients.
On the other hand, the concept that biliary atresia
consists of two major types based on the clinical as-
pects has been accepted [9, 10]. One is the fetal, em-
bryonic or prenatal type, and the other is the acquired
or perinatal type. The perinatal type is believed to ac-
count for 70-80% of all biliary atresia. The etiology of
biliary atresia has remained obscure. Two hypotheses
have been put forward. The first is called the ductal
plate malformation theory, which assumes a congeni-
tal anomaly of the intrahepatic bile trees. According to
the other theory, the progressive occlusion of the ex-
trahepatic bile duct is probably triggered by viral in-
fection and worsened by the subsequent immunopa-
thological process. Reovirus, rotavirus [11, 12], cy-
tomegalovirus [13, 14] and others have been proposed
as likely causative viruses, but no clear relation has
been found. To the best of our knowledge, there are
only a few reports [1, 15, 16] on the analysis of viral
infections based on direct detection of viral genomes
from liver tissues.
B19 was discovered serendipitously in the sera of
normal blood bank donors while screening for the
hepatitis B virus. B19, a member of the family Parvo-
viridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, genus Erythrovirus, is
a small single stranded DNA virus. B19 is a patho-
genic virus that is widely distributed in human popu-
lations. This virus is responsible for various clinical
manifestations including erythema infectiosum in
children, polyarthropathy syndrome in adults, tran-
sient aplastic crisis inpatients with chronic anemia,
persistent infections manifesting as chronic anemia in
immunocompromised patients, transplant recipients,
and hydrops fetalis and fetal death by intrauterine
infection. Aplastic anemia, which occurs in 33% of
children and 5% of adult patients who undergo or-
thotopic liver transplantation (OLT) for non-A, non-B,
non-C fulminant hepatitis is pointed out as a compli-
cation with a high rate of mortality [17]. The cause of
aplastic anemia after OLT may include factors such as
posthepatitic aplasia, B19, and drugs. Langnas et al. [1]
reported the possibility of B19 as the cause of non-A-C
fulminant hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. Actu-
ally, B19 may be an etiologic agent for hepati-
tis-associated aplastic anemia, because of the known
tropism of B19 for erythroid precursors [18]. On the
other hand, negative data are also present. Wong et al.
[16] reported no association with fulminant hepatitis
or hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. Lee et al. [19]
reported no evidence for hepatitis E or parvovirus B19
infection in patients with acute liver failure.
To investigate the possibility that B19 infection of
the liver might cause fulminant hepatitis and biliary
atresia, we conducted a study to obtain direct evi-
dence of a viral sequence in the liver from patients
who underwent liver transplantation. In this retro-
spective study of 47 patients with liver diseases of
unknown etiology, B19 DNA was detected in the liver
obtained from 17 patients. We postulated that the vi-
rus might even be detected in liver that is serologically
negative for the virus. In fact, our results showed that
only one case was sero-positive for the B19 sequence
among 8 cases with intrahepatic-B19 DNA. These re-
sults suggest that seronegativity for the B19 sequence
does not exclude the existence of present infection of
B19 within the liver. Similar finding was reported by
Eis-Hubinger et al [20]. They showed B19 DNA is fre-
quently present in livers of anti-B19 seropositive
adults suggesting persistence of B19 in the liver. Our
results also indicate that direct detection of viral ge-
nomes in tissues by a highly sensitive method is as
important as serology. In the present study, we found
a high prevalence of B19 infection not only in fulmi-
nant hepatitis patients, but also in biliary atresia pa-
tients. However, all fulminant hepatitis patients in-
fected with B19 had the replicative form of B19 mRNA.
While, low rate of B19 mRNA detection in biliary
atresia patients who had intra-hepatic B19 DNA sug-
gested silent infection of B19. This suggests that B19
may be a cause of severe hepatic diseases although
this remains to be investigated.
B19 has a genome length of 5.4 kb with hairpin
structures at each extremity. B19 encodes three major
viral proteins: VP1 and NP2, the viral capsid proteins,
and NS1, a nonstructural protein. Both VP1 and VP2
are derived from overlapping reading frames and
share substantial amino acid sequences. NS1 is known
to be implicated in viral replication, the activation of
viral gene transcription, and target cell cytotoxicity
[21-25]. Among the sequence records deposited in the
database, only 16 isolates of B19 have been sequenced
in the full or nearly full-genome so far. Here we re-
ported that the nearly full-length sequence of B19 was
isolated from 10 patients with liver diseases. It is
known that B19 has a genome length of 5.4 kb with
hairpin structures at each extremity; in addition, a
partial deletion and rearrangement of the sequence
exist in the extremity regions. These findings indicate
the difficulty in amplifying the sequences in these re-
gions. In our study, we attempted to amplify each ex-
tremity, but failed. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis
based on the NS1 gene revealed three different clus-
ters: two for isolates from fulminant hepatitis and the
Int. J. Med. Sci. 2007, 4 109
other for isolates from biliary atresia cases. This find-
ing suggests the existence of genotypes. Viral geno-
type has diagnostic and clinical implications, includ-
ing use for assessing responses to anti-viral therapy
and future vaccine development. The possibility that
such variation is involved in the severity of associated
liver disease, and that the difference between symp-
tomatic and asymptomatic infection, may also occur as
well as HBV and HCV. Furthermore, among each
genotype, specific sites of the deduced amino acid se-
quence change were identified in the NS1 gene. Clari-
fication of the relation between the genotypes or vari-
ants of B19 and its pathogenicity in hepatic failure in-
cluding hepatitis and biliary atresia is awaited with
great interest. To solve these important issues, a geo-
graphical study of the B19 genomes and various dis-
eases including liver diseases in different countries is
now planning and we shall report on further investi-
gations in the future.
In conclusion, we found a high prevalence of B19
infection in livers from patients with fulminant hepa-
titis and biliary atresia. Interestingly, all fulminant
hepatitis patients infected with B19 had the replicative
form of B19 mRNA. It is noteworthy that serum B19
DNA was not detected in 7 of 8 cases that were he-
patic B19 DNA-positive. Phylogenetic analysis based
on the NS1 gene revealed three different clusters. Our
results presented here suggested that B19 may serve
as an etiologic agent for severe hepatitis.
Conflict of interest
The authors have declared that no conflict of in-
terest exists.
