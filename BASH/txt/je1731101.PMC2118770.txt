Summary
Recipient-antidonor alloreactivity before HLA genotypically identical bone marrow transplantation
(BMT) between donor-recipient pairs that are negative in the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR),
the cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assay, and the lymphocyte crossmatch was not detectable
in the majority of cases, using recipient peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) collected before
BMT as responder cells and donor PBL as stimulator cells. However, when donor bone marrow
mononuclear cells (BMMNC) instead of PBL were used as stimulator cells, we could detect
donor-specific alloreactivity in 7 of 10 HLA genotypically identical donor-recipient pairs. To
demonstrate that this alloreactivity was minor histocompatibility (mH) antigen specific and not
directed against HLA class I splits or variants, two cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines were
tested in further detail against phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts from pairs of HLA genotypically
identical siblings positive for the HLA class I restriction molecule. Both CTL lines recognized
mH antigens, as illustrated by the differential recognition ofPHA blasts of one ofthe two siblings
from several pairs. The potential role of these mH antigen-specific CTLs in bone marrow graft
rejection was demonstrated by the mH antigen-specific growth inhibition of hematopoietic
progenitor cells from the original bone marrow donor and from HLA class I restriction
molecule-positive individuals who expressed the mH antigens on their PBL and BMMNC. Our
assay can be used in HLA genotypically identical BMT to detect a recipient-antidonor response,
directed against cellularly defined mH antigens expressed on donor HPC, BMMNC, and PBL,
before transplantation.
cute graft-vs .-host disease (aGVHD)t represents one of
the major complications after allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) with unmodified grafts. Removal of
T lymphocytes from the marrow graft has been effectively
used to prevent aGVHD (1, 2). However, T cell depletion
is associated with an increased risk ofgraft failure (3-7), prob-
ably due to reduced immune suppression as a result of
removing immunocompetent donor cells from the graft. This
may lead to immune-mediated graft failure by residual allo-
reactive recipient cells directed against antigenic determinants
expressed on donor cells from the graft, especially in recipients
who are sensitized byprevious blood transfusions (8-15). Graft

failure may also be influenced by several other mechanisms,
such as recipient stromal cell defects (16), viral infections
(16-18), and loss of accessory cell function due to the T cell
depletion procedure (19).
Immune-mediated graft rejection after transplantation of
a marrow graft from an HLAidentical sibling donor appears
to be caused by CTLs of recipient origin (20-22). Minor
histocompatibility (mH) antigens, which are recognized in
the context of HLA class I antigens (23, 24), are the target
structures for these CTLs. Residual immunocompetent T cells
that have survived the conditioning regimen (25-28) may
recognize and lyse donor cells that express mH antigens. Pre-
viously, we have shown that the mH antigens HY and HA-3
are expressed on human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC)
and that these cells are subject to lysis by mH antigen-specific
CTLs (29). The clinical relevance of these findings was illus-

trated in a sensitized recipient who rejected her HLA-identical
marrow graft (25).
The occurrence of graft rejection after HLA genotypically
identical BMT cannot be accurately predicted since no assays
are available to detect recipient-derived immunocompetent
Tlymphocytes reactive with donor cells, before BMT. Reac-
tivity or nonreactivity of the pretransplant MLR does not
correlate with the occurrence of graft rejection after HLA
genotypically identical BMT (30); only in those recipients
who are strongly sensitized to allo-antigens by multiple blood
transfusions can antidonor reactivity be detected (8, 13, 25, 31).
Here, we report a method that can be used to detect allo-
immune reactivity ofrecipient cells against mH antigenic de-
terminants expressed on cells of donors who are negative in
the MLR, the cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) assay, and
the lymphocyte crossmatch before HLA genotypically iden-
tical BMT Using HLA genotypically identical donor bone
marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) as stimulator cells and
recipient PBL collected before BMT as responder cells, we
were able to generate mH antigen-specific CTL lines. These
CTL lines did not only lyse donor PBL but also inhibited
donor HPC growth in an antigen-specific manner. There-
fore, this assay provides a method to study mechanisms respon-
sible for bone marrow graft rejection after HLAidentical BMT
Materials and Methods
Patients. All patients suffered from acute myeloid or lympho-
cytic leukemia and were transplanted in first or second complete
remission with bone marrow from their HLAgenotypically iden-
tical siblings, who are negative in the MLR, the CML assay, and
lymphocyte crossmatch . All patients had received blood products
that were leukocyte depleted to prevent allo-immunization (32).
Collection ofPBL. PBL were isolated from heparinized blood
by Ficoll-Isopaque (1.077 g/cm3) density centrifugation (1,000 g,
20 min, 20°C). The interphase cells were harvested and washed
twice in RPMI 1640 plus 5% FCS (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Is-
land, NY). For cryopreservation, the cells were resuspended at a
concentration of 10' cells/ml in cryopreservation medium con-
sisting of 70% RPMI, 20% FCS, and 10% DMSO, frozen, and
preserved in liquid nitrogen. Immediately before use, the cells were
thawed for 1 min in a 37°C waterbath, diluted in RPMI plus 20%
FCS, and washed twice in the same medium. The cells were then
resuspended in RPMI plus 15% pooled human serum (RPMI plus
15% serum).
Collection ofBone Marrow. Normal human bone marrow was
obtained, after informed consent, from donors for BMTby aspira-
tion from the posterior iliac crests. The marrow suspension was
diluted in RPMI plus 5% FCS and centrifuged over Ficoll-Isopaque.
The interphase BMMNCwere harvested, washed twice in RPMI
plus 5% FCS, diluted at a concentration of 10' cells/ml in
cryopreservation medium, and frozen using a computer-controlled
freezer (Cryoson, Middenbeemster, The Netherlands), as described
(33). Immediately before use, the cells were thawed, washed, and
resuspended in RPMI plus 15% human serum.
PHA Blasts. 10' PBL were cultured in RPMI plus 15% serum
and 0.2% PHAM (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) for 3 d. The
cells were then washed and cultured further in the absence ofPHA
in medium consisting of RPMI plus 15% serum and 40 U rIL

2/ml. After 2-3 d of culture in this medium, cells were used as
targets in a "Cr release assay.
Generation ofRecipient-derived T Lymphocyte Lines Using Donor
PBL as Stimulator Cells. Recipient PBL collected before BMTwere
'used as responder cells at a concentration of 106 cells/ml. They
were stimulated with 2 x 106/ml irradiated (30 Gy) HLA geno-
typically identical donor PBL and cultured in 24-well tissue cul-
ture plates in medium consisting of RPMI plus 15% serum. After
this initial step,,three different culture protocols were used.
First, after 7 d'of culture, medium was replaced by RPMI plus
15% serum and 40 U rIIr2/ml. On day 10, the responder cells
were restimulated with irradiated (50 Gy) EBVtransformed donor
lymphocytes, and this was repeated once weekly, while twiceweekly,
culture medium was replaced by RPMI plus 15% serum and 40
U rIIr2/ml.
Second, effector cells were cloned after 9 d of culture by lim-
iting dilution at seven concentrations ranging from 300 to 0.3
cells/well. The cells in each well were cultured in the presence of
2 x 104 irradiated allogeneic PBL and 104 irradiated EBV
transformed donor lymphocytes in 0.2 ml ofRPMI plus 15% serum,
1% leukoagglutinin (Leuko-A; Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Espoo,
Finland), and 40 U rIlr2/ml. After 8-10 d, growing wells were
split and assayed for cytotoxicity against donor PHAblasts. Alter-
natively, growing wells were split and analyzed for the expression
ofthe CD8 antigen with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FAC-
Scan; Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, Mountain
View, CA) and then assayed for rytotoxicity against donor PHA
blasts. Cells that were selected based on their cytotoxic activity
or CD8 antigen expression were further expanded using irradiated
allogeneic PBL and EBVtransformed donor lymphocytes. Cell sub-
lines were derived from wells plated at concentrations ranging from
300 to 10 cells/well.
Third, responder cells were restimulated with irradiated donor
PBL on day 4 and depleted of CD4' cells on day 8 by comple-
ment-mediated rytotoxicity, as described (34). Briefly, 1-2 x 10'
cells were resuspended in 1 ml RPMI plus 15% serum, and in-
cubated with an equal volume ofa 100-fold dilution ofRIV6 (anti-
CD4 specificity) mAb in RPMI for 30 min at 4°C. Baby rabbit
complement (Pel-Freez Biologicals, Rogers, AR) of prescreened
batches was then added to a final concentration of 50%. The sus-
pension was incubated again for 1 h at 37°C. Finally, cells were
washed three times in RPMI plus 10% FCS, resuspended in RPMI
plus 15% serum at the appropriate cell concentration, and cloned
by limiting dilution. When a sufficient number of effector cells
could be harvested, a "Cr release assay was performed using PHA
blasts and EBVtransformed cells from donor and recipient as target
cells.
Generation ofRecipient-derived TLymphocytes Lines Using Donor
BMMNCas Stimulator Cells. Recipient PBL collected before BMT
were used as responder cells at a concentration of 106 cells/ml.
They were stimulated with 2 x 106/ml irradiated (30 Gy) HLA
genotypically identical donor BMMNCand cultured in 50-ml tissue
culture flasks in RPMI plus 15% serum. On day 7, medium was
replaced by RPMI plus 15% serum and 20% Tcell growth factor
(TCGF; Biotest, Offenbach, FRG). On day 14, responder cells were
restimulated with irradiated donor BMMNCin a responder/stimu-
lator ratio of 1:10, together with RPMI plus 15% serum and 20%
TCGF. On day 21, responder cells were restimulated with irradi-
ated EBVtransformed donor lymphocytes. When enough cells could
be harvested, a "Cr release assay was performed using PHA blasts
and EBVtransformed cells from donor and recipient as target cells.
In some cases, recipient-derived PBL were stimulated with donor-
derived PBL, using this culture protocol.
"Cr Release Assay. Standard "Cr release assays were performed
as described (35). Briefly, target cells consisting of PHA blasts,
EBVtransformed cells, or BMMNC were labeled with 0.1 ml
Na251CR04 (100 /CCi) for 1 h in a 37°C waterbath, washed three
times with HBSS, and then resuspended in RPMI plus 15% serum
at a concentration of 5 x 10" viable cells/ml. 0.1 ml of the effector
cell suspension and 0.1 ml of the target cell suspension were added
to each well of a round-bottomed microtiter plate at E/T ratios
ranging from 40:1 to 10:1. To measure spontaneous release of "Cr,
0.1 ml of the target cell suspension was added to 0.1 ml RPMI
Plus 15% serum without effector cells, while maximum release
was determined by adding 0.1 ml of the target cell suspension to
0.1 ml of a Zaponine solution. The percentage of lysis was deter-
mined as follows: 100x (experimental release cpm - spontaneous
release cpm)/(maximum release cpm - spontaneous release cpm) .
Cell-mediated Lysis ofHPC. 1.25 x 101 BMMNC in 0.2 ml
medium consisting of33% FCS and 66% a-modified Eagle's MEM
(a-MEM; Flow laboratories, Irvine, Scotland) was mixed with CTLs
at E/T cell ratios varying from 4:1 to 0.5:1.
The cell mixture was centrifuged (1,000 g, 15 s) to establish
cell-cell contact between CTLs and BMMNC, and then incubated
for 6-18 h in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5% C02 at 37°C.
After incubation, the cells were resuspended, and 1.05 ml culture
medium was added to a final concentration of 20% FCS, 40%
tx-MEM, 40% of a 2.25% methylcellulose solution in a-MEM,
and 100 U/ml glycosilated recombinant human granulocyte/mac-
rophage (GM) CSF (Sandoz-Schering Plough, Basel, Switzerland).
Subsequently, 1 ml semisolid medium containing 101 BMMNC
was incubated in a fully humidified atmosphere of 5% C02 and
37°C, and cultured for 10 d. The number of CFU-GM colonies,
defined as granulocytic, monocytic of eosinophilic aggregates of
>20 cells, were scored on day 10 under an inverted microscope.

tween CTLs and BMMNC, and to exclude the possibility of
nonspecific inhibition ofHPC growth due to the presence ofcyto-
toxic cells in the semi-solid culture medium, CTLs were added to
BMMNC immediately before plating. CTLs were irradiated (20
Gy) before use to prevent colony formation by these cells.
Calculations andNormal Values. The level of 100% growth was
defined as the number of colonies cultured from 101 untreated
BMMNC. The number of colonies in these cultures was always
within the normal range for our laboratory (CFU-GM: 160 f
101 [mean ± SD]/101 BMMNC plated). In cellular cytotoxicity
assays, the percentages ofsurviving HPC were calculated by dividing
the total number of colonies by the number of colonies in the un-
treated control cultures.
Phenotype ofCTL Lines. The phenotypes of the CTL lines and
clones were analyzed on a FACscan using mAbs against the CD3,
CD4, and CD8 antigens (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry
Systems).
Results
As shown in Table 1, no donor-specific lysis could be de-
tected using donor PBL as stimulator cells and recipient PBL
as responder cells irrespective of the three culture protocols
used; in some cases, cytotoxicity directed against donor EBV
cells or the allogeneic feeder cells was observed. The cell lines
and the cell sublines that were obtained after these culture
protocols consisted of a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ cells.
Most of the cell clones were CD4+ when not enriched for
CD8+ cells before cloning (data not shown). Cloning after
depletion of CD4+ cells resulted in generation of predomi-
nantly CD8+ clones. The proliferative capacity of the cell

after 3 wk of culture.
In contrast to the results obtained with PBL as stimulator
cells, the use ofHLA genotypically identical donor BMMNC
as stimulator cells resulted in a strong specific cytotoxic re-
sponse, i.e., only donor PHA blasts and not recipient PHA
blasts were lysed in 7 of 10 donor-recipient combinations
tested, demonstrating donor-specific allo-reactivity (Fig. 1).

both donor-derived BMMNC and PBL were used separately
as stimulator cells, and cultures were performed under iden-
tical conditions, i.e., addition of TCGF on day 7 and res-
timulation with original stimulator cells on day 14. In two
offour pairs, and antidonor response was only detected after
stimulation with donor BMMNC (pairs 1 and 6), while in
one combination (pair 7), antidonor reactivity was also present
after stimulation with donor-derived PBL. In one combina-
tion (pair 10), no donor-specific cytotoxicity could be gener-
ated., Two other cell lines, derived from recipients 8 and 9,
showed no donor-specific cytotoxicity and had a similar
proliferative capacity as the other cell lines, resulting in >3
x 107 cells after 3 wk of culture. All cell lines tested con-
sisted of a mixture of CD4' and CD8+ cells.
The CTL line from recipient 1 (CTL line 1) recognized
a mH antigen, restricted by HLAA2 or HLA-B44. The mH
antigen specificity was demonstrated by the differential rec-
ognition of one of six HLAA2+ and HLAB44+ HLA
genotypically identical sibling pairs and three of eight HLA
B44+ HLA genotypically identical sibling pairs (Table 2).
Both siblings of two of the HLAA2+ and HLAB44+ pairs
were recognized by CTL line 1, whereas siblings of the re-
maining three pairs were both negative for expression of the
mH antigen. Siblings of one of the five remaining HLA-
B44+ pairs were both positive for mH antigen expression,
whereas the other four sibling pairs were negative. As shown
in Table 2, PHA blasts of both siblings of 29 HLAA2+
HLA genotypically identical sibling pairs were recognized
by the CTL line from recipient 2 (CTL line 2), whereas the

(n = 12) and 31% for the HLA-B44-restricted mH antigen
(n = 16), recognized by CTL line 1. For the HLAA2-
restricted mH antigen (n = 62) and the HLA-B37-restricted
mH antigen (n = 8) recognized by CTL line 2, the frequen-
cies of expression were 97 and 50%, respectively.
To study their potential role in bone marrow graft rejec-
tion, the two mH antigen-specific CTL lines were assayed
for cytotoxicity against HPC and BMMNC collected by aspi-
ration from the posterior iliac crests from several individuals,
either positive or negative for mH antigen expression on PHA
blasts or negative for expression of the relevant HLA class
I restriction molecules (Table 3). Results obtained in "Cr
release assays using PHA blasts and BMMNC as targets cor-
related well with results obtained in the assays for HPC growth
inhibition in most cases (CTL line 1: Table 3 and Fig. 2, A
and B; CTL line 2: Tables 3 and 4) . Individuals expressing
the mH antigen on their PHA blasts and BMMNC also
showed HPC growth inhibition, whereas individuals nega-
tive for mH antigen expression on PHA blasts and BMMNC
or individuals lacking the relevant HLA class I restriction
element showed no HPC growth inhibition. An exception
to these observations was the absence of lysis of BMMNC
from individual B by CTL line 1 (Table 3), whereas PHA
blasts and HPC were lysed.
CTL line 1 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of HPC
growth of the bone marrow donor (Fig. 2 A) and of two
unrelated HLAB44+ individuals expressing the mH antigen
on their PHA blasts (Fig. 2 B). CTL line 2 inhibited HPC
growth ofthe bone marrow donor and of two unrelated HLA-
B37` individuals almost completely even, at the lowest E/T

anti-mH CTL clone (the anti-HA-3-specific CTL clone [23,
29]) and CTL line 1 did not inhibit HPC growth when target
cells did not express the relevant HLA class I restriction mol-
ecule or the mH antigen, respectively, demonstrating that
the presence ofCTLs per se did not induce nonspecific growth
inhibition of HPC.
Before HLA genotypically identical BMT, the detection
of allo-reactivity between donor and recipient has not been
possible because no assay was sufficiently sensitive (30, 36,
37). Only in patients who were strongly sensitized to allo-
antigens by multiple blood transfusions (8, 13, 15, 23, 31)
and in patients who were transplanted with HLA-matched
unrelated donors (38) has it been possible to detect allo-
reactivity between donor and recipient before BMT. The pa-
tients in our study group had received leukocyte-depleted blood
products to prevent allo-immunization (32). Only a small
percentage (9%) of patients transfused with such blood prod-
ucts have been reported to develop allo-antibodies (39). In
the patients studied, allo-antibodies were only present in pa-
tients 4 and 8, as demonstrated by decreased 1-h increments
after platelet transfusions from six random donors. No an-
tidonor immune response could be detected in the patients
studied, using the standard MLR, the CML assay, and the
lymphocyte crossmatch before BMT
In this report, we demonstrate that, using genotypically
identical BMMNC as stimulator cells, it is possible to gener-
ated mH antigen-specific CTL lines from recipient PBL col-
lected before BMT Only once was an antidonor-specific cyto-
toxic response observed after stimulation with donor-derived
PBL, while all other attempts to generate donor-specific cy-
totoxicity using PBL as stimulator cells followed by expan-
sion with donor EBV cells or allogeneic PBL resulted in cyto-
toxic reactivity against EBV or allogenic feeder cells only.
Modification of this protocol, e.g., cloning at an early stage
of the immune response and depletion of CD4+ prolifera-
tive T cells to prevent overgrowth of EBVspecific T lym-
phocytes, was unsuccessful in generating specific CTLs. Be-
cause, until now, all described mH antigen-specific CTLs
are CD8+ and HLA class I restricted (23, 40), depletion of
CD4+ T cells by anti-CD4 mAb and complement could
have resulted in a growth advantage of CD8+ mH an-
tigen-specific CTLs. However, no such effect was observed.
These results are in accordance with reports by others and
our own group showing that it was not possible to isolate
mH antigen-specific CTLs before BMT or kidney transplan-
tation from recipient-derived peripheral blood, using donor
PBL as stimulator cells. Such responses could only be obtained
after in vivo sensitization (23, 41, 42). This is probably due
to better or different antigen presentation in vivo, resulting
in an increased frequency of mH antigen-specific CTLs.
Because the target cells in bone marrow graft rejection are
HPC, we next used BMMNC ofthe HLA genotypically iden-
tical bone marrow donor as stimulator cells and recipient PBL,
collected before BMT as responder cells. Using this protocol,

combinations. In two of four donor-recipient combinations
where either donor BMMNC or PBL were used as stimu-
lator cells under identical culture conditions, donor-spe-
cific cytotoxicity was observed only after stimulation with
BMMNC and not after stimulation with PBL. The absence
of cytotoxicity in the three remaining T cell lines was not
due to an insufficient number of cells because proliferation
was similar to the other seven CTL lines. The cytotoxicity
of the two CTL lines derived from recipients 1 and 2, which
were tested in further detail, proved to be directed against
mH antigens that were not only expressed on cells of bone
marrow donor, but also on cells of many unrelated individ-
uals positive for the HLA class I restriction molecule. This
was shown by the differential recognition of PHA blasts ob-
tained from pairs of HLA genotypically identical siblings by
both CTL lines, demonstrating that the observed cytotox-
icity is mH antigen specific and not directed against splits
or variants of HLA class I molecules. The expression of the
same mH antigen on cells of a large number of unrelated
individuals implicates that these antigens are widely distributed
in the population and are not unique for one individual. As
a consequence, it may be possible to type for a limited number
of frequently occurring mH antigens, which may give
sufficient information about the potential allo-reactivity be-
tween donor and recipient, either in the host-vs.-graft or the
graft-vs.-host direction.
The absence of lysis of "Cr-labeled BMMNC from in-
dividual B, whose PHA blasts are lysed and whose HPC are
specifically growth inhibited by CTL line 1, may be caused
by a lower expression ofthe HLA class I restriction molecule
or of the mH antigen itself on the surface of relatively ma-
ture myeloid precursor cells. Similarly, we previously observed
References
a decreased reactivity of an HLAA1-restricted HYspecific
CTL line with day 4 cluster-forming cells and mature my-
eloid cells from HLAAl + males as compared with PBL and
day 10 CFU-GM (43) . The reactivity of the CTL lines with
PBL and HPC demonstrates the potential role of mH an-
tigen-specific CTLs in bone marrow graft rejection.
No graft rejection was observed in the 10 recipients. The
actual occurrence of graft rejection will depend on the bal-
ance between immunocompetent donor and recipient lym-
phocytes after BMT. Apparently, in these 10 recipients, the
conditioning regimen was effective in abrogating recipient
antidonor alloreactivity. Our observations indicate that the
occurrence ofgraft rejection after BMT is not predominantly
dependent on qualitative antigenic disparity between donor
and recipient but appears to be the result of quantitative re-
sidual antidonor reactivity of the recipient lymphocytes that
survived the conditioning regimen. Therefore, particularly
in BMT with T cell-depleted marrow, intensifying pre-
transplant conditioning regimens or post-transplant im-
munosuppression may decrease the incidence of graft rejec-
tion. Comparison of mH antigen-specific cytotoxic activity
present before and after BMT in patients with full engraft-
ment or graft rejection may provide information about the
relative importance of different mH antigen-specific CTLs
and the necessity of matching for these mH antigens. These
questions are currently under investigation in our laboratory.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that mH antigen-
specific CTL lines can be generated in vitro in a high per-
centage of HLA genotypically identical donor-recipient pairs
using donor BMMNC as stimulator cells and recipient PBL,
collected before BMT, as responder cells. These CTLs are
capable of lysing HPC and may therefore play a role in BM
graft rejection after HLA genotypically identical BMT
