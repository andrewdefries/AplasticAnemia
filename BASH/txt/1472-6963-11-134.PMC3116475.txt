Drug-related admissions and hospital-acquired
adverse drug events in Germany: a longitudinal
analysis from 2003 to 2007 of ICD-10-coded
routine data
Jürgen Stausberg*
and Joerg Hasford
Abstract
Background: Adverse reactions and medication errors are complications of drug use. Spontaneous reporting
systems and pharmacoepidemiological studies incompletely detect the occurrence of these events in daily hospital
care. In this study, the frequency and type of drug-related admissions and hospital-acquired adverse drug events
(ADE) in Germany were assessed using routinely collected hospital data.
Methods: The study was based on aggregated hospital routine data covering the period 2003 to 2007 and
annually recorded as part of the further development of the German Diagnosis-Related Groups. The 505 ICD-10-
codes indicating an ADE were categorized in seven groups according to their certainty. Primary diagnoses were
considered as a proxy for drug-related admissions, and secondary diagnoses as a proxy for hospital-acquired ADE.
Results: Among all hospital admissions, 5% were found to be at least possibly drug-induced and 0.7% very likely
drug-induced. There was a significant increase in the overall rate of drug-related admissions over time (p < 0.038).
Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile infection was the most frequent cause of a drug-related admission. About
4.5% of in-patients had experienced a hospital-acquired ADE. In addition, over the course of the study period, the
overall frequency of hospital-acquired ADEs significantly increased (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: In Germany, more than 5% of hospital episodes are either caused or complicated by an ADE.
Between 2003 and 2007, there was a statistically significant increase in the overall rate and in some of the
subcategories defined by the list of ICD-10-codes suspected to be indicative of an ADE. Before the use of routine
data in pharmacovigilance and patient safety can be fully exploited, a further tailoring of both the ICD and the
available variable set is needed.
Background
Adverse drug events (ADE) occur as a consequence of
medication errors or as adverse drug reactions (ADR).
Studies and systematic reviews have revealed that 5-10%
of all internal-medicine admissions result from ADRs.
Moreover, 5-10% of all in-patients are expected to suffer
from severe ADRs, and ADRs rate among the leading
causes of death in the Western world [1-6]. However,
30-40% of those ADR are considered to be preventable
[3,7]. A report by the US American Institute of Medi-
cine, “To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health Sys-
tem,” together with other, similar international reports,
has had a lasting effect on public awareness with regard
to safe pharmacotherapy and the prevention of medica-
tion errors [8]. In addition, as a result of these publica-
tions, critical-incident reporting systems and
computerized physician-order entry systems combining
patient- and medication-related information were
recommended and subsequently introduced as a key
approach to the reduction of medication errors [9-11].
With respect to ADRs, a variety of monitoring systems
have been developed, the oldest and most common one

being the spontaneous reporting system [12]. In addi-
tion, there have been ad hoc epidemiological studies
such as cohort and case-control studies whose aim was
to elucidate the etiology of adverse events. Furthermore,
the use of databases from health insurances and health
care providers is very common in North America, the
UK and Scandinavian countries where, compared to
Germany, data confidentiality laws are less restrictive
[13-15]. The traditional monitoring systems lack either
in completeness due to an unsystematic approach [16]
or lack in representativity due to a selective study design
(cf. [17,18] as examples for studies in single hospitals).
By contrast, routinely collected reimbursement data pro-
mise both, completeness and representativity, through
the coverage of nearly the whole population [19]. How-
ever, routinely collected reimbursement data have only
rarely been evaluated for their suitability in pharmacov-
igilance and, especially, in the assessment of the ADEs
of in- and out-patients in England and the United States
[20-23]. Nonetheless, as the results of those few studies
were in part encouraging, we decided to analyze the
suitability of such databases in Germany.
In a recent report focusing on data from 2006, we
showed that routinely collected hospital reimbursement
data can be used to identify the frequency and type of
ADE [24]. The present study explores this innovative
approach in a nearly complete longitudinal sample of all
in-patients. Specifically, we used this database to exam-
ine the frequency of drug-related admissions in Ger-
many and of hospital-acquired ADEs during the years
2003 to 2007.
Methods
Definition
An ADE was defined as an injury resulting from a medi-
cal intervention related to a drug and thus included
medication errors and ADRs [25-27]. Since a clear dif-
ferentiation between ADRs and medication errors was
not possible based on the available routine data; both
events were subsumed within the definition of an ADE.
Therefore, we refer to an ADR only if this term was
used in the literature, even though the literature does
not always provide a clear definition of an ADR.
Database
German hospitals are obliged to annually deliver a stan-
dard data set to the Institute for the Hospital Remu-
neration System (InEK). The data consist of information
on all in-patients who are evaluated according to the
system of diagnosis-related groups (DRG); thus, data
from psychiatric and psychotherapeutic departments are
excluded. The InEK uses the collected data for further
development of the German DRG system (G-DRG). The
hospital routine data comprise, among other items,
diagnoses coded by the International Statistical Classifi-
cation of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th
Revision, German Modification (ICD-10-GM) and pro-
cedures coded according to a national classification of
operations and procedures (OPS). The OPS lists only a
few drugs intended for reimbursement; otherwise, medi-
cation as such is excluded.
Cleared and aggregated data are freely published as
Microsoft Access files under http://www.g-drg.de/. The
public data cover only those patients with a normal
length of stay (LOS). In principle, “normal” is defined
for each DRG as ranging between one-third of the LOS
arithmetic mean and the LOS arithmetic mean plus two
standard deviations. One sheet of the database shows
the ICD-10-GM codes together with information on the
frequency as a primary and as a secondary diagnosis for
each of the years 2003 to 2006. For 2007, the InEK pub-
lished this sheet only for a voluntary sample of 10% of
the hospitals delivering additional data from cost-unit
accounting. The variables, definitions, and data-sampling
procedures of the data collections between 2003 and
2006 and during 2007 were identical.
A projection of the results to the total number of in-
patients in Germany for the years 2003 to 2007 is imple-
mented assuming the representativity of both the
patients with a normal LOS and the hospital sample.
The total number of in-patients was drawn from further
information provided by the InEK.
Identification of relevant ICD-10 codes
In the ICD-10-GM, 505 codes indicating a possible ADE
were identified (cf. appendix for a list of the codes) [24].
This list extends previous work [11,28,29]. The identi-
fied codes were classified into seven categories, each
with respect to its validity as an indicator for an ADE
and its definition in the ICD-10. These categories are as
follows:
• Category A.1: A drug-related causation was noted in
the ICD-10, e.g., G44.4 “Drug-induced headache, not
elsewhere classified.”
• Category A.2: A drug- or other substance-related
causation was noted in the ICD-10, e.g., I42.7 “Cardio-
myopathy due to drugs and other external agents.”
• Category B.1: The event was denoted as a drug poi-
soning, thus implying an unphysiological dosage, e.g.,
T36.0 “Poisoning: Penicillins.”
• Category B.2: The event was denoted as poisoning
by or harmful use of drugs or other substances, e.g.,
T50.9 “Poisoning: Other and unspecified drugs, medica-
ments, and biological substances.”
• Category C: A drug related causation was very likely,
e.g., A04.7 “Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile.”
• Category D: A drug-related causation was likely, e.g.,
F52.2 “Failure of genital response.”

• Category E: A drug-related causation was possible, e.
g., J81 “Pulmonary edema.”
Regarding categories A.2 and B.2, other substances or
measures may have caused the adverse event. The cod-
ing of categories C to E lacks an explicit reference to a
medication. The German modification of the ICD-10
offers only a few codes for “Complications of medical
and surgical care” (group Y40-Y84), detailed in the
chapter “External causes of morbidity and mortality.” In
particular, there is no information on specific drugs.
These codes were assigned to categories A2 and C.
Due to repeated changes in the ICD-10-GM, the code
list differs from year to year and the number of codes
has increased from 482 (in 2003) to 505 (in 2009). In
terms of content, the list has remained unaffected. The
exception was in 2003, when the code for drug-induced
agranulocytosis and neutropenia was not available in the
ICD-10. Table 1 shows the number and percentage of
codes for each of the seven categories. Over 70% of the
codes (categories A to C) indicate an ADE as being very
likely.
Drug-related hospital admissions
After thorough examination and analysis, the diagnosis
that directly led to the hospital admission was defined
as the primary diagnosis, according to the German cod-
ing standards [30]. There was exactly one primary diag-
nosis for each hospital episode. An ADE coded as
primary diagnosis was therefore always acquired before
the current episode. For that reason, the results related
to the primary diagnoses served as a proxy for drug-
related hospital admissions.
Hospital-acquired ADE
According to the German coding standards, every dis-
ease other than the one coded as the primary diagnosis
and requiring diagnostic, therapeutic, supportive, nur-
sing, or monitoring efforts has to be coded as a second-
ary diagnosis [30]. This definition therefore includes
comorbidities as well as complications. A definite dis-
tinction between “prior to admission” and “acquired
during hospitalization” was not possible because a
“present on admission” indicator was not available [31].
However, the results related to the secondary diagnoses
were used as a proxy for hospital-acquired ADEs.
Between 2003 and 2006, the number of secondary diag-
noses per case increased from 3.5 to 4.4 (2003: 3.5,
2004: 4.0, 2005: 4.1, 2006: 4.4, and 2007: 4.3). To control
for this increase, the results for hospital-acquired ADEs
were standardized based on the average number of such
events in 2006, as the reference year. It should be noted
that one case can simultaneously be assigned several
codes from one or more of the categories A to E.
Statistics
Data from the years 2003 to 2006 represented three-
quarters of the target population of all in-patients in
Germany, with both absolute and relative frequencies
reported. To identify a trend within the categories, a lin-
ear regression was performed using the nationwide rate
as the dependent variable and the year as the indepen-
dent variable. Statistical significance was assumed at p ≤
0.05. The data were administered with Microsoft Access
2007 and analyzed with Microsoft Excel 2007 and
PASW Statistics 17.0.
Results
About 48 million hospital episodes were included in this
analysis of ADEs. From 2003 to 2006, the InEK sheets
covered between 11,205,770 and 11,978,011 hospital epi-
sodes (Table 2), representing between 72% (2003) and
79% (2006) of all episodes recorded with the G-DRG
system. The 10% sample of hospitals in 2007 consisted
of 1,964,313 episodes (13% of all episodes in 2007). Fig-
ure 1 shows the averages of the annual ADE rates in the
seven categories.
Drug-related hospital admissions
The results from the years 2003 to 2007 for the various
categories are presented in Table 3. Between 0.54% and
0.67% of the episodes were assigned a primary diagnosis
from categories A to C (2003: 0.54%, 2004: 0.62%, 2005:
0.63%, 2006: 0.67%, and 2007: 0.64%). These episodes
were very likely caused by drug-related hospital

admission. The missing code for drug-induced agranulo-
cytosis and neutropenia accounts for the lower rate of
0.54% in 2003. Five percent of the admissions were at
least possibly drug related (categories A-E). Over time,
there was a highly significant rise in category C,
implying an increase in very likely ADEs (p < 0.001).
Likely ADEs (category D, p = 0.029) as well as the over-
all rate (p = 0.038) increased considerably; in contrast to
the slight decrease in drug-induced or other intoxica-
tions (category B.2, p = 0.010). There were no statisti-
cally significant changes in the remaining categories.
Among categories A to C, the ten most frequent
events in 2005 and 2006 were the same, with only a
small change in their ranking (Table 4). In all other
years, these diagnoses ranked among the top 20. The
most frequent drug-related cause for a hospital admis-
sion was enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile infec-
tion, responsible for almost one out of every 1000
episodes.
Hospital-acquired ADE
Between 4.46% (in 2005) and 4.60% (in 2006) of all epi-
sodes included a secondary diagnosis from categories A-
C (Table 5). These diagnosis were very likely drug-
induced with a suspicion for being hospital-acquired.
This result represents an upper estimate because pre-
admission diseases were recorded as well. There was a
statistically significant increase in the number of events
in categories A.1 (p = 0.008), C (p = 0.022), D (p =
0.001), E (p = 0.003), and overall (p < 0.001), and a sta-
tistically significant decrease in categories A.2 (p =
0.018), B.1 (p = 0.054), and B.2 (p = 0.005).
With minor deviations, the ten most frequent events
in categories A-C in 2006 ranked among the top 20
events in other years (Table 6). The unspecific code
T88.7 was the most frequent one from categories A to
C in 2006 but not in 2007. In Table 6, Y57.9 is a supple-
mentary code of the ICD-10-GM and is solely used in
order to classify a disease even more precisely.
Discussion
Drug-related hospital admissions
According to German routine data from 2003 to 2007,
almost 0.7% of all hospital admissions were very likely
drug-related. Reasons for admission coded as a second-
ary diagnosis remained unconsidered. This suggests that
the results represent a lower estimate. From 2003 to
2007, there was a considerable increase in diseases that
were very likely ADEs and which resulted in hospital
admission. The reason for this increase is not known.
The proportion of in-patients 80 years and older
increased continuously between 2003 and 2007. Asso-
ciated with this aging population might be an increased
risk of ADEs due to multimorbidity and subsequent
polymedication. Among all hospital admissions, 5% were
at least possibly drug-related. Hence, a relevant number
of hospital admissions in Germany can be ascribed to
adverse drug reactions and medication errors. The most
common ADEs remained the same over time.

In a review of 25 prospective observational studies, a
5.3% rate of ADR-related admissions was estimated [4].
Waller et al. examined drug-induced hospital admissions
using the Hospital Episodes Statistics database from
England [21]. Their analysis showed that 0.35% of hospi-
tal admissions were coded as ‘drug-induced’. The ICD-
10 codes considered by in that study roughly correspond
to categories A.1 and C of the present work. The rate of
0.35% is in accordance with the range of 0.20 (2003,
categories A.1 and C) to 0.34 (2007, categories A.1 and
C) in Germany. The frequency of recorded ADRs has
increased over time in both England and Germany. Wal-
ler et al., drawing conclusions from the Hospital Epi-
sodes Statistic in England, reported an increase of 40%
between 1996 and 2000 [21], and Patel et al., in another
study carried out in England, calculated an increase of
45% between 1998 and 2005 [32]. In Germany, we
determined an increase of 30% in drug-related admis-
sions between 2004 and 2007 as indicated by a primary
diagnosis assigned to categories A.1 and C.
Hospital-acquired ADE
According to our findings, an ADE as consequence of a
hospital stay can be expected in almost 5% of hospital
episodes. This percentage, however, has to be under-
stood as an approximate upward assessment since there
were no case-related data. At 5%, drug-related ICD
codes represent almost 50% of the estimated 10% of in-
patients in Germany who suffer an adverse event [33].
There has been an overall increase in hospital-
acquired ADEs. A documentation artifact was controlled
for in the presented study by standardizing the average
number of secondary diagnoses in 2006. On the one
hand, the increase in the mean number of diagnoses
between 2003 and 2006 can be explained by improved
completeness of recording complications and comorbid-
ities. On the other hand, there are case-mix changes,
since the population has become older. However, both
decreases in the length of stay and the comorbidity mea-
sure have remained stable over time (Table 2).
The rate of suspected cases in Germany is similar to
the estimate of 5.3% reported by Kongkaew et al. [4]. In
Western Australia, the trend of repeated in-hospital
treatments due to ADR was examined between 1980
and 2003 based on the reimbursement data of patients
60 years of age and older [28]. During the entire study
period, the rate was about 5.9% but the number of
repeat admissions increased. The authors exclusively
used supplementary codes for the identification of an
ADR according to the ICD-9 and ICD-10, such as
Y57.9, and took into account both pre-admission and
in-hospital ADRs [28].
The literature is not always precise in differentiating
between ADEs leading to admission and hospital-
acquired ADEs. For example, a nationwide study from
The Netherlands analyzed primary and secondary diag-
noses together to assess the frequency of ADE-related
hospitalizations [34]. For 2001, the rate was 1.83%. Our
results are similar to those from a retrospective review
of clinical records published by Brennan et al. [35].
However, a meta-analysis of prospective studies yielded
an estimate of 15.1%, which represents a considerably
higher rate of ADR episodes than determined in the
present study [3]. The German Coalition for Patient
Safety suggests an overall estimate of 5-10% for in-hos-
pital adverse events [33]. Most of these events occur in
a surgical context, followed by ADE and systemic fac-
tors. Adverse events in connection with other diagnostic,
therapeutic, or invasive procedures are reportedly less
frequent [36].
Routine data
In a few studies, only routine hospital statistics were
used in the assessment of ADEs. The results are

comparable to ours and it was consistently suggested
that this database can contribute positively to health
monitoring with respect to drug-related patient safety
issues, although the issue of underassessment remains.
A differentiation between adverse drug reactions and
medication errors as well as between comorbidities and
complications is at the moment only partially accom-
plished by the ICD and the variables available in the
data set. The application of routine data to medication
safety and pharmacovigilance would therefore benefit
from a further tailoring of the ICD-10. For example, the
codes of categories A.2 and B.2 should be divided into
those pertaining to drug-related events and those per-
taining to other causes. This should be taken into
account by the WHO in the 11th revision of the ICD.
Furthermore, an enrichment of routine data by integrat-
ing data derived from other electronic sources related to
hospital information systems might additionally enable
an automatic signaling even on the level of the indivi-
dual patient [37]. For example, lab results and sequences
of lab results can deliver important information about
ADEs. Also, the inclusion of a “present on admission”
indicator could differentiate between complications and
comorbidities [31]. However, from our point of view,
this indicator only partially solves the underlying pro-
blem of distinguishing between the two conditions, as it
is closely related to differing notions about comorbidity
[38-40]. For example, an adverse event due to a medica-
tion error occurring in hospital stay A is still hospital-
acquired if the patient is later admitted to hospital stay
B, but then the event is considered “present on admis-
sion.” Thus, for improved patient safety and pharmacov-
igilance, information is needed independently of
administrative events. In the above example, the date
the event was recognized should be recorded by anno-
tating the diagnosis code, thus preserving information
on the course of the disease. Medications are not cur-
rently included in hospital routine data in Germany,
although some codes of the ICD-10-GM cover such
information, for example in group F10-F19 “Mental and
behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use.”
Thus, it might be possible to similarly correlate drugs
and events for specific areas.
Study limitations
The recording of an ADE requires the identification of a
drug as the cause of the symptom or the disease. This
identification may be difficult but it is imperative when
using the specific codes of the ICD-10-GM (categories
A.1, A.2, B.1, and B.2). In addition, differences in ADR-
definitions affect adversely the reliability of ADE signal
systems [41,42]. A contamination of our results due to
the inclusion of other causes (e.g., self-poisoning) in
categories A.2 and B.2 has to be accepted, given the mix
of different causes covered by a single ICD-10-code.
Furthermore, since the list of variables provided by the
InEK is limited, multiple counting of a single case has
to be accepted.
Reliability and validity issues of administrative data
may restrict the generalization of the presented results
[43]. However, the coding quality of diagnoses and pro-
cedures in German hospitals has reached a standard
high enough to allow the use of hospital routine data
for quality management as well as health services
research [44-47]. Revenue protection claims likewise
require a detailed and correct documentation.
The average number of secondary diagnoses per case
increased from 2003 to 2007. To exclude changes in
registration habits, we standardized the rates of hospital-
acquired ADEs according to their average number in
2006.
Although routine data may well be sufficient in terms
of completeness of diagnoses and operative procedures,
their accuracy is not confirmed. For example, in our
study, ADEs present on admission were unintentionally
counted as hospital-acquired if recorded as the second-
ary diagnosis. We expect situations such as this one to
be the exception, however, and they do not invalidate
the results regarding hospital-acquired ADEs.
Conclusions
The results of this study support the innovative
approach of using hospital routine data to obtain
health-related statistics regarding medication safety and
pharmacovigilance. The analyses show an increase in
drug-related admissions and hospital-acquired ADEs in
Germany, in line with studies from other countries. This
increase should be further evaluated in studies based on
detailed data. Routine data provided by hospitals and
physician offices are a reliable and valid platform for
obtaining information on patient safety and are free of
the cost resources incurred by data acquisition. Thus, a
refinement of the ICD is recommended, as it will con-
tinue to improving both the monitoring of patient safety
and pharmacovigilance. Moreover, the data can be used
by Health Department/Ministry politicians, patient orga-
nizations, health insurance institutions, and pharmaceu-
tical companies to evaluating drug safety over time, as a
supplement to established methods such as spontaneous
reporting systems. Restrictions occurring through the
limited information available, such as the absence of
data regarding medication, remain to be addressed.
