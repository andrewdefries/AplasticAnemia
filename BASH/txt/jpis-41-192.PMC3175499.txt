Purpose:  The aim of this study is to compare the gene expression profile in mesenchymal stem cells derived from dental tis-
sues and bone marrow for characterization of dental stem cells.
Methods:  We employed GeneChip analysis to the expression levels of approximately 32,321 kinds of transcripts in 5 samples
of bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) (n=1), periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) (n=2), and dental
pulp stem cells (DPSCs) (n=2). Each cell was sorted by a FACSVantage Sorter using immunocytochemical staining of the early
mesenchymal stem cell surface marker STRO-1 before the microarray analysis.
Results:  We identified 379 up-regulated and 133 down-regulated transcripts in BMSCs, 68 up-regulated and 64 down-regulat-
ed transcripts in PDLSCs, and 218 up-regulated and 231 down-regulated transcripts in DPSCs. In addition, anatomical struc-
ture development and anatomical structure morphogenesis gene ontology (GO) terms were over-represented in all three dif-
ferent mesenchymal stem cells and GO terms related to blood vessels, and neurons were over-represented only in DPSCs.
Conclusions:  This study demonstrated the genome-wide gene expression patterns of STRO-1+
mesenchymal stem cells de-
rived from dental tissues and bone marrow. The differences among the expression profiles of BMSCs, PDLSCs, and DPSCs
were shown, and 999 candidate genes were found to be definitely up- or down-regulated. In addition, GOstat analyses of reg-
ulated gene products provided over-represented GO classes. These data provide a first step for discovering molecules key to
the characteristics of dental stem cells.

INTRODUCTION
Stem cells are undifferentiated cells characterized by the
ability at the single cell level to both self-renew and differen-
tiate to produce mature progeny cells [1,2]. The embryonic
stem cells and the adult stem cells are two major categories
of stem cells. Adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells found
in specialized tissues and organs of adults. Compared to the
embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells that exist in various
organs of the body are easily accessible and less controversial
in ethical terms [3,4].
The presence of adult stem cells in dental tissue has been

formally proven. Seo et al. [5] reported that periodontal liga-
ment stem cells (PDLSCs) expressed the mesenchymal stem-
cell markers STRO-1 and CD146/MUC18. Up to now, 5 differ-
ent human dental stem/progenitor cells have been described
in the literature: dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), stem cells
from exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED),periodontal ligament
stem cells (PDLSCs),stem cells from apical papilla (SCAP),and
dental follicle progenitor cells (DFPCs) [5-11]. These cells are
easily accessible and, in contrast to bone-marrow-derived
mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), are more intimately asso-
ciated with dental tissues [3].
There are plenty of adult stem cells available for possible
cell-based tissue engineering.Traditionally,BMSCs have been
studied for bone regeneration. BMSCs are a population of
multipotent, non-hematopoietic marrow-derived cells that
are easily expanded in culture and differentiate into cells with
an osteogenic phenotype [12,13]. Transplantation of BMSCs
showed enhancement of periodontal tissue regeneration and
bone formation [14,15]. Since dental stem cells were first iden-
tified, these cells have come under the spotlight in dental tis-
sue engineering. Recently, numerous investigators have at-
tempted to use these cells for dental tissue regeneration to
assess their potential in pre-clinical applications [16,17]. Con-
sequently, dental tissues are clinically accessible in routine
clinical practice like tooth extraction, possibly providing a
readily available source of stem cells, and these dental stem
cells may be an ideal source for clinical periodontal regener-
ative therapy [5,16,18].
However, little is known about the characteristics of dental
stem cells. In the case of PDLSCs, the PDL is composed of
heterogeneous cell populations and thus far no highly puri-
fied PDLSCs clone has yet been established from human PDL
tissue [18-20]. The challenge lies in the ability to identify a
dental stem cell-specific marker that allows for the selection
of a pure dental stem cell population [21].
The development of microarray methods for large-scale
analysis of mRNA gene expression makes it possible to search
systematically for key molecules [22,23]. After introduction of
these genome-wide research techniques, there have been
various attempts to describe and compare the gene expres-
sion patterns of more specialized adult stem cells for cell
characterization [24-26].
The aim of this study was to compare the gene expression
profile in mesenchymal stem cells derived from dental tis-
sues and bone marrow for characterization of dental stem
cells. In this study, the gene profiles from two individual
PDLSCs and DPSCs samples were compared with BMSCs as
a control.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Normal human extracted premolars were collected from
one adult man (19 years old) and one adult woman (18 years
old) at the Department of Dentistry, Asan Medical Center.
The subjects were selected according to the following inclu-
sion criteria: A person scheduled for tooth extraction for
orthodontic reasons, general good health, absence of peri-
odontal disease, and being a non smoker. Both of the sub-
jects were thoroughly informed about the use of the extract-
ed teeth and gave written consent for inclusion and genetic
testing in the study. This study was approved by the Institu-
tional Review Board of Asan Medical Center (No. 2010-0233).
Cell culture
The extracted premolars were placed into regular transfer
medium and the PDL and the pulp tissue extracted and pre-
pared as single cell suspensions as previously described [5,6].
Briefly, the PDL was gently separated from the root surface
of the middle third of the extracted teeth.The pulp tissue was
also separated after the tooth surfaces were cleaned and cut
around the cementum-enamel junction by using a sterilized
dental disk to reveal the pulp chamber. The PDL and pulp
tissues obtained were digested in a solution of 3 mg/mL col-
lagenase type I (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 4 mg/mL
dispase (Gibco) for 1 hour at 37°C. Single-cell suspensions
were obtained by passing through a 70 µm stainer (BD Bio-
sciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).
To identify the putative stem cell, single-cell suspensions
(1×104
cells) were seeded into 10 cm culture dishes with al-
pha-modification of Eagle’s medium (Gibco) supplement with
15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), 100 mol/L ascorbic acid
2-phospate (Fluka Chemie GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland), 100
U/mL penicillin (Gibco), and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco)
and incubated at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide. The cells of the
colonies (aggregates of 50 or more cells) were collected and
stored in liquid nitrogen until use.
BMSCs, processed from marrow aspirates of a normal hu-
man adult volunteer (female, 22 years old), were purchased
from LonzaWalkersville Inc. (Walkersville, MD, USA).
In this study, cell passage 2 of the PDLSCs and DPSCs and
passage 4 of the BMSCs were used for purification by a FACS
Vantage cell sorter (FACS Vantage SE, Becton Dickinson, San
Jose, CA, USA) and for further procedures.
Sorting of STRO-1+
cells
The sorting was carried out on a FACSVantage Sorter using
immunocytochemical staining of the early mesenchymal
stem cell surface marker STRO-1 following previously re-
Journal of Periodontal
& Implant ScienceJPISGene expression profile in dental stem cells194
ported methods [27].
Cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-human STRO-1
primary antibody (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA)
in 2% FBS/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hour. After
three washes with 2% FBS/PBS, the cells were incubated with
fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse im-
munoglobulin M secondary antibody (BioFX Laboratories
Inc., Owings Mills, MD, USA) for 30 minutes. Cells were
washed and resuspended in regular growth medium. All the
above procedures were performed in the dark at 4°C.
The expression profiles of STRO-1 on cells were examined
and sorted by the FACSVantage sorter.The sorting gates were
set to sort the strong positive STRO-1 cells and exclude the
weak positive ones. The sorted cells were collected in a tube
containing growth medium. The cells were seeded into 10
cm culture dishes and incubated until they were just sub-
confluent.
RNA isolation
The sorted and expanded cells were stored in RNAlater
(Ambion Diagnostics Inc., Austin, TX, USA) for RNA extrac-
tion and preparation for the gene chip experiments. Total
RNA was isolated applying a mirVana miRNA isolation kit
(Ambion Diagnostics Inc.), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA concentration was quantified with a Nano-
Drop spectrophotometer (NanoDropTechnologies Inc.,Wilm-
ington, DE, USA), and the RNA integrity was evaluated using
Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,
USA).
Microarray analysis
300 ng of total RNA was used for labeling. Probe synthesis
from the total RNA samples, hybridization, detection, and
scanning were performed according to standard protocols
from Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the
Whole Transcript (WT) sense target labeling and control re-
agents kit (Affymetrix, Inc.). Double-stranded cDNA was syn-
thesized with random hexamers tagged with a T7 promoter
sequence.The double-stranded cDNA was subsequently used
as a template second cycle of cDNA synthesis, and random
hexamers were used to prime reverse transcription of the
cRNA from the first cycle to produce single-stranded DNA in
the sense orientation. In order to reproducibly fragment the
single-stranded DNA and improve the robustness of the as-
say, a novel approach was utilized where UTP was incorpo-
rated in the DNA during the second-cycle,first-strand reverse
transcription reaction.This single-stranded DNA sample was
then treated with a combinatoion of Uracil-DNA glycosylase
& apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 that specifically rec-
ognized the unnatural dUTP residues and broke the DNA
strand. DNA was labeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl trans-
ferases with the WT terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix, Inc.).
The labeled cDNA was hybridized to the Human Gene 1.0 ST
array (Affymetrix, Inc.) at 45°C for 17 hours according to the
Affymetrix standard protocol. After hybridization, the arrays
were washed in a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 with a non-
stringent wash buffer at 25°C followed by a stringent wash
buffer at 50°C. After washing, the arrays were stained with a
streptavidin-phycoerythrin complex. After staining, intensi-
ties were determined with a GeneChip scanner 3000 (Affyme-
trix, Inc.), controlled by GCOS Affymetrix software.
Data analysis
We performed three comparisons: BMSCs and PDLSCs,
BMSCs and DPSCs, and PDLSCs and DPSCs. First, we fit a
model that had a mean for each group, and tested whether
the group means were different. The eBayes function in the
R package Limma [28] was used to compute an empirical
Bayes factor, pooling the variances from all the genes to esti-
mate significance. After that, we had a model fit that estimat-
ed the log ratios between the two group samples for each of
the three times. The fit also had an estimate of the Bayes fac-
tor and the log odds of differential expression for each gene.
Estimated P-values using a number of multiple testing cor-
rections were computed using Benjamini-Hochberg correc-
tion [29]. The adjusted P-value’s cutoff is 0.001. We identified
differentially expressed genes in each test. Each differentially
expressed gene was analyzed using DAVID for analysis [30].
RESULTS
Isolation of mesenchymal stem cells using FACS Vantage
Sorter
Isolation of STRO-1+
cells from each heterogeneous popu-
lation was conducted using a FACS sorter machine. 0.96%
and 1.38% STRO-1+
PDLSCs, 0.81% and 2.3% STRO-1+
DPSCs
and 0.73% STRO-1+
BMSCs were successfully isolated using
sorting gates strictly (Fig. 1). There were some differences in
expression of STRO-1 between the patients and among the
cell types.
Gene expression profile
We employed GeneChip analysis to expression levels of ap-
proximately 32,321 kinds of transcripts in 5 samples of BM-
SCs (n=1), PDLSCs (n=2), and DPSCs (n=2). Each sample was
tested in triplicate to reduce technical errors. Altogether, 15
GeneChips were used to examine the gene expression profile
of three different types of mesenchymal stem cells.
Differential expression was stated if a distinct transcript

met the adjusted P-value’s cutoff of 0.001. We identified 999
differentially expressed genes. In BMSCs, we identified 379
up-regulated transcripts, such as IGFBP5, KRT34, and DKK1,
and 133 down-regulated transcripts, such as BEX1, GSTT1,
GREM1, and NES. In PDLSCs, we identified 68 up-regulated
transcripts, such as EBF2, PLXNC1, IL7R, and SATB2, and 64
down-regulated transcripts, such as TLR4, EDN1, and LMCD1.
In DPSCs, we identified 218 up-regulated transcripts, such as
BMP2, NES, COL18A1, EFHD1, and TGFB2, and 231 down-reg-
ulated transcripts, such as KRT34, GALNT5, and PENK. The
most thoroughly up- and down-regulated genes in each cell
types are listed inTables 1-3.
Additionally, heatmap, comparing the 53 genes most differ-
entially expressed in PDLSCs, DPSCs, and BMSCs was shown
(Fig. 2).
Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis
Major over-represented GO classes are listed in Table 4. In
BMSCs, enrichment of gene productions were associated
with the major GO classes of skeletal system, system, ana-
tomical structure, and embryonic skeletal system develop-
ment. In general, anatomical structure development and an-
atomical structure morphogenesis GO terms were over-rep-
resented in all three-different mesenchymal stem cells. In
DPSCs, only GO terms related to blood vessels and neurons
were over-represented.
DISCUSSION
In this study,we compared mesenchymal stem cells derived
from dental tissues and bone marrow by employing genome-

wide gene expression profiling and gene ontology analysis.
The expression profiles of BMSCs, PDLSCs, and DPSCs were
found to differ from those of each others. By GeneChip anal-
ysis, 999 genes were found to be definitely up- or down-reg-
ulated. In addition, GOstat analyses of regulated gene prod-
ucts provided over-represented GO classes. These data pro-
vide a first step for discovering key molecules related to the
characteristics of dental stem cells.
The development of genome wide research techniques en-
ables describing and comparing the gene expression patterns
of different cells. Using these data, we can better understand
the mechanisms governing the display of each cell’s charac-
teristics [25]. Recently, several microarray studies have been
performed to identify new diagnostic markers and to inves-
tigate the origin of, as well as a genes characterizing progres-
sion of, various diseases including cancers [31-34].
In the dental field,a few studies about the characteristics and
differentiation of dental cells were reported using genome-
wide research techniques [24,35,36]. Furthermore, previous
studies about dental stem cells only used heterogeneous
dental stem cells. In this study, we used a FACSVantage Sort-
er for isolation of STRO-1+
mesenchymal stem cells, and we
first attempted to solve the problem of heterogeneity in den-
tal stem cells for microarray studies.
The heterogeneity of the dental stem cell population re-
mains one of the key obstacles to implementing optimal ap-
proaches to cell-based tissue engineering. Because dental

stem cell-specific surface markers have not yet been identi-
fied, general mesenchymal stem cell markers like CD44,
CD90, CD146, and STRO-1 have been used to identify stem
cells from dental tissues [27,37]. Although the cells sorted us-
ing STRO-1 and CD146 markers have been used in some
previous studies, no marker for dental stem cells has been
established. In our study, we used the STRO-1 marker, which
is the most common marker for mesenchymal stem cells.
The subset of marrow cells that expresses the STRO-1 anti-
gen is capable of differentiating into multiple mesenchymal
lineages including hematopoiesis-supportive stromal cells
with a vascular smooth muscle-like phenotype, adipocytes,
osteoblasts, and chondrocytes was reported. Flow cytometry
revealed that 1 to 5% of the PDL cells cultured using previous-
ly described methods [5] were STRO-1+
in human and animal
models and the fluorescence values from the FACS data de-
creased with an increasing number of passages [16,27,37,38].
Comparably, 0.73-2.3% STRO-1+
cells were successfully isolat-
ed in this study by strict screening of strong positive cells.
Shi et al. [24] reported that insulin-like factor binding pro-
tein-7 (IGFBP7) was highly expressed in BMSCs and collagen
type XVIII α1 (COL18A1) was highly expressed in DPSCs. In

the present study, IGFBP5 was strongly up regulated in BM-
SCs and COL18A1 similarly in DPSCs. Representatively, inter-
leukin 7 receptor (IL7R) was highly expressed in PDLSCs and
transforming growth factor (TGFB2), while bone morphoge-
netic protein 2 (BMP2) was in DPSCs.
IL7R has been shown to play a critical role in V(D)J recom-
bination during lymphocyte development. Several diseases
are associated with IL7R including multiple sclerosis, rheu-
matoid arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis [39]. IL7R
gene expression in PDLSCs may be a target molecule to study
of chronic inflammatory disease like periodontitis. BMP2 is
one of osteoinductive BMPs: it have been demonstrated to
potently induce osteoblast differentiation in a variety of cell
types [40]. The increased levels of BMP2 in DPSCs may sug-
gest the possibility of using DPSCs as cell-sources for bone
regeneration in tissue engineering.
Gene ontology is a tool for the systematic analysis of large-
scale gene-expression data. GO analysis is based on the hy-
pothesis that functionally related and differentially expressed
genes should accumulate in the corresponding GO term.
When the data of microarrys show a long list of significant
genes, the soution can be found by pooling of genes into
fuctional classes and GO database provides such a fuctional
classificaton. According to GO analysis, anatomical structure
development and anatomical structure morphogenesis GO
terms were over-represented in all three different mesen-
chymal stem cells. However, GO terms related to blood ves-
sels and neurons was over-represented in DPSCs, uniquely.
These facts clearly show that the characteristic of dental stem
cells is similar to that of BMSCs, and the dental stem cells
also have other specific characteristics. Additional studies
should be carried out to reveal the meaning of major over-
represented GO terms in each cell.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated the genome-wide
gene expression patterns of STRO-1+
mesenchymal stem
cells derived from dental tissues and bone marrow. The dif-
ference of the expression profile of BMSCs, PDLSCs and DP-
SCs were showed and 999 candidate genes were found to be
definite up- or down-regulated. A validation study of candi-
date gene expression is required using additional samples
and additional analytical studies should be carried out to ful-
ly explore the functional role of the differentially expressed
genes identified using microarray analysis. The study of the
differences according to the presence of specific stem cell
markers is also needed. Prospectively, the gene expression
information of dental stem cells might provide significant
insights into the development of dental tissues and the cel-
lular differentiation processes. Dental stem cells could also
be practicable tools for dental tissue engineering.
