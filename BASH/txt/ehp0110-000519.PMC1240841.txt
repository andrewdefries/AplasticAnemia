Thousands of Iranian soldiers were exposed
to mustard gas during the Iraq-Iran war
from 1983 to 1989 (1). Mustard gas, also
known as sulfur mustard (SM), is an alkylat-
ing agent with mutagenic effects (2).
Mustard gas became recognized as the first
of a new class of toxins known as “blistering
agents.” Skin contact, which could occur via
airborne concentrations that penetrate easily
through most clothing, led to damage rang-
ing from a sunburnlike scald to bullous
necrosis. Eye contact with SM caused severe
corneal injury, and inhalation induced acute
tracheobronchitis with massive epithelial
sloughing (3).
Previous studies have shown that the risk
of lung cancer increases after long-term, low-
level exposure to mustard gas (4). There
have been no reports of chronic myelocytic
leukemia (CML) following SM exposure or
of a conﬁrmed relationship between alkylat-
ing agents and CML (5). According to data
from one of the military health centers, two
cases of CML have been reported in 2 con-
secutive years in soldiers who had a history
of mustard gas exposure during the war. We
therefore undertook this study to seek a rela-
tionship between SM exposure and the
development of CML.
Materials and Methods
Among 2,500 chemical warfare victims in
Isfahan province, Iran, we studied 665 war
victims exposed to SM during the Iraq–Iran
war. SM poisoning was documented in this
population by military health services within
a few hours of injury. Military specialists
documented the type of chemical agent and
reported to health center services within a
few hours of attacks.
Inclusion criteria. All included cases had
documented SM exposure. These victims all
developed blisters to areas of their bodies
within a few hours of exposure, they had
transient decreased vision lasting several
days, and they had respiratory symptoms
such as chronic bronchitis for several years.
Exclusion criteria. We excluded patients
with fever, active infectious disease, or a his-
tory of hormone use [i.e., adrenocorti-
cotropic hormone (ACTH) or adrenal
17-OH-corticosteroids]. We completed a
demographic questionnaire for each patient.
Complete blood count (CBC), peripheral
blood smear, and bone marrow smears were
performed and studied by a hematologist.
Cytochemical staining of peripheral blood
smears for leukocyte alkaline phosphatase
(LAP) tests was performed using the Kaplow
method (6). Smears were studied immedi-
ately after staining, and 100 neutrophil gran-
ules were examined. To score neutrophils on
a blood smear, 100 consecutive band neu-
trophils and polymorphonuclear leukocytes
were counted and rated by intensity from 0
to 4+, deriving a ﬁnal LAP score of 0–200.
We considered scores > 20 normal and < 20
abnormal; abnormal results were studied
with complementary tests. To examine the
value of LAP activity, we referred single cells
to one of three groups: negative (0 score),
weakly positive (+1, +2 score), and strongly
positive (+3, +4 score). We performed cyto-
genetic studies on bone marrow aspiration
samples of low–LAP-score cases after stan-
dard culture in cases with LAP activity < 20.
Cytogenetic readers did not know anything
about the cases or their data. We measured
serum zinc by an atomic absorption method
and performed statistical analysis using the
Student’s t-test to compare means.
Control group. We selected healthy men
of the same age from a premarriage counsel-
ing center to use as controls. We performed
only the CBC test in this group.
Results
The mean ages (± SD) were 34 ± 3 years for
the patients and 34 ± 1.2 for the control
group. The average time lapse from injury
was 12 ± 2 years. Table 1 indicates the means
of the blood indices of the two groups, along
with the statistical results. The mean LAP
score of the patients was 59.9 ± 18.2. Nine
cases had LAP scores < 20, and two cases had
a score of 0 and were reported as CML cases;
the other data for these two cases are shown
as cases 1 and 2 in Tables 2 and 3. The
CBCs with differentiation, Philadelphia
chromosome, and serum zinc level for these
patients are listed in Table 2. In case 1, the
Philadelphia chromosome was positive with
typical laboratory manifestations of CML,
the LAP score was 0, peripheral blood smears
had high white blood cell counts and a shift
to the left compatible with CML. Case 2 also
showed cellular morphology of peripheral
blood smears and bone marrow typical of
CML and low serum zinc but was negative
for the Philadelphia chromosome. The cyto-
genetic ﬁndings of these two cases and others
with low LAP scores are shown in Table 3.
From among the nine cases affected by SM,
we found seven cases (77%) of karyotypic
clones that were diploid and two cases (23%)
that were pseudodiploid, including one with

Articles
Chemical agents such as mustard gas (or sulfur mustard), which has alkylating characteristics,
were used against Iranian combatants in the Iraq–Iran war. Previous studies have not shown a
strong link between these chemical agents and the development of chronic myelocytic leukemia
(CML). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the increased risk of CML development in
Iranian soldiers exposed to mustard gas during the war. Based on a descriptive study of 2,500
cases with documented exposure to various chemical warfare agents, 665 patients had docu-
mented exposure to mustard gas. We screened the latter using the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase
(LAP) test and performed further cytochemical studies on cases with positive results. From
among the 665 cases with documented exposure to mustard gas, 9 cases had LAP scores < 20; 2
of these 9 cases had CML and a score of zero (0.3%). We detected cytogenetic abnormalities in 7
patients with low LAP scores and atypical lymphocytes of 5–11% in 40 patients. The risk ratio of
CML developing in victims exposed to mustard gas (cutaneous or respiratory) may be higher in
comparison with the normal population, although confounding factors (e.g., the possibility of
exposure to combined chemical agents, excluding patients who did not manifest blisters) limited
our results. Because the increased development of CML in young patients with a documented his-
tory of exposure to mustard gas cannot be disregarded, further studies are needed. Key words:

the classic Philadelphia chromosome. In all
of nine cases, the other minor clones (Table
3) accompanied the major clonal abnormali-
ties. Three of these had hyperdiploid clones.
Discussion and Conclusion
Acute complications of SM on the
hematopoietic system have been reported
repeatedly during the Iraq–Iran war (7–9).
Aplastic anemia resulting in death, as well as
reversible patterns, has also been docu-
mented (8,10). We have found no published
data documenting CML development after
exposure to SM. In the cases in our study,
SM exposure was documented because of
blisters on the skin and long-term respiratory
disorders, symptoms caused by no other
chemical warfare agent. In our study group,
blood indices revealed signiﬁcant differences
with the control group because of the large
sample, but this was not meaningful clini-
cally. Although victims with severe respira-
tory exposure to SM do not survive, victims
do survive when exposure is not excessive.
Patients with fever, active infectious disease,
or a history of drug use (i.e., ACTH, adrenal
17-OH-corticosteroids) were excluded from
this study because these factors have been
shown to affect the LAP test (11).
CML is a disease of the elderly, and its
peak incidence is usually in the ﬁfth and sixth
decades of life. The annual incidence of CML
is about 1 per 100,000, and it appears to be
constant worldwide. From among 2,500 cases
with documented exposure to various chemi-
cal warfare agents, 665 patients had docu-
mented exposure to mustard gas. We found
two cases with CML in 2 consecutive years.
Although we could not ascertain whether
combined chemical gases were used along
with SM in the study group, we veriﬁed expo-
sure to this gas in all cases by the aforemen-
tioned inclusion criteria. In our study, we
chose the control group from among the nor-
mal population and not from war veterans
because low-dose exposure without signiﬁcant
symptoms may have been present among
these soldiers. If we accept only the case with
positive Philadelphia chromosome as a CML
case, then this may be a sporadic case with no
relation to mustard gas exposure. However, if
we consider it as an outcome of SM, then the
occurrence rate is 1 case per 2,500, and this
prevalence is 400 times greater than that in
the normal population. These ﬁndings com-
pelled us to evaluate all of SM-exposed vic-
tims for leukemia in a well-designed study
that should be completed by 2004.
LAP scoring is a method that is widely
used in diagnostic hematology. This method
establishes a discriminating factor between
CML and other conditions with leukemoid
reactions (12,13). LAP is consistently reduced
in persons with CML, paroxysmal nocturnal

hemoglobinuria, and hypophosphatasia, and
can be used to diagnose these disorders. Low
levels of LAP have also been reported in
thrombotic thrombocytic purpura, aplastic
anemia, and sickle cell disease. We ruled out
these conditions in seven cases without
CML by clinical and laboratory review of
the ﬁndings. Although it is not obvious why
LAP scores decreased, this decrease may be
related to the presence of other cytogenetic
abnormalities that are present in these
patients, and follow-up studies should deter-
mine that. Previous studies have shown that
the LAP test is a ﬁrst-line test for CML and
generally precedes a diagnostic algorithm
that also includes bone marrow biopsy, cyto-
genetic analysis, and molecular diagnostics
(14). Although bcr/abl would have helped to
definitively confirm CML in our cases, we
did not ﬁnd a laboratory expert in this analy-
sis in Iran at the time of our study. The
Philadelphia translocation results in the
fusion of the bcr and abl genes in a head-to-
tail fashion. The bcr gene loses a 3´ section,
which is replaced by a 3´ abl sequence from
chromosome 9.
This study also shows that the LAP test
can be used as a screening test for detection
of CML in high-risk patients. Previous
reports have shown that ionizing irradiation
(15) and occupational exposure to nonioniz-
ing radiation through electrical work are
linked particularly to CML (16). Benzene
exposure is also acknowledged to increase
the risk of myeloid leukemia (17) and case
reports have linked CML with ingestion of
cytotoxic drugs (18). Because of failure to
follow up thousands of World War II veter-
ans (in Australia, the United States, and
Canada) exposed to SM, there is no report
regarding CML development. To our
knowledge, this is the first case report that
links inhalation of SM, an alkylating agent,
with the development of CML. Our ﬁndings
indicate that the incidence of CML among
war veterans is significantly greater than in
the general population.
