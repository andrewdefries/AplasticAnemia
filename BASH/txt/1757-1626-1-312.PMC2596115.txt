Abstract
Introduction: Antiepileptic drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome is a rare side effect of some
of the first line anticonvulsive drugs such as carbamazepine and other aromatic agents. We are the
first to mention a rare case of gastrointestinal, skin and cardiac findings related to carbamazepine
administration, which is very uncommon and needs to be reported.
Case presentation: We report on a 62-year-old Caucasian woman with carbamazepine
associated hypersensitivity syndrome, who developed diarrhea, fever, skin lesions, pericardial
effusion and pathology on electrocardiogram with terminal negative T waves in I, II, aVL, V5 and V6,.
After withdrawal of carbamazepine and administration of methylprednisolone, all initial symptoms
improved, white blood cell count normalized, pericardial effusion resolved and pathologic
electrocardiogram findings resolved.
Conclusion: Anticonvulsive drug hypersensitivity syndromes can present with a wide spectrum of
unspecific symptoms, which the prescribing clinician should be aware of.
Introduction
Antiepileptic drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome
(AEDHS) is a rare side effect of some of the first line anti-
convulsive drugs such as carbamazepine (CBZ) and other
aromatic agents. Typically AEDHS presents with skin
lesions, fever and lymphadenopathy; in more severe cases
also internal organs may be involved [1-6].
CBZ is administered for the treatment of simple and com-
plex epileptic seizures, trigeminal neuralgia and alcohol
withdrawal syndrome. The drug has anticonvulsive and
anticholinergic properties by reducing excessive nerve sig-
nals in the brain and restoring the normal balance of
nerve activity. Side effects include diarrhea and colitis,
aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis as well as other rare
conditions such as cardiotoxicity [7,8].
Due to this broad spectrum of side effects, differentiation
from AEDHS may be difficult, but CBZ has been linked to
AEDHS affecting the liver, lungs and kidneys [1-6,9]. We

report on a patient with CBZ associated AEDHS who
developed diarrhea, fever, skin lesions and pathology on
electrocardiogram.
Case presentation
A 62-year-old Caucasian woman, 5.4 ft and 165 lbs, with
no history of drug use was admitted to a neurological
emergency unit after a first epileptic seizure event report-
ing of monthly recurrent ill temper. She reported past
cholecystectomy 2001, positive family history for prostate
cancer (father) and Alzheimer's disease (mother). The
patient had two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, no
smoking history and alcohol consumption occasionally.
No medication separate to this case. Neurological workup
included EEG, CT of the brain, MRT but no intracranial
pathology could be demonstrated. Blood and CSF chem-
istry were unremarkable and serum as well as CSF tested
negative for bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic pathogens,
Thus it was suspected that the patient suffered from epi-
lepsia and abdominal pain was thought to represent an
epigastric aura. Treatment with CBZ at a dose of 200 mg
twice daily was started.
Ten days after introduction of CBZ the patient developed
a reddish maculo-papulous rash with pruritus affecting
her entire body except the face and legs; simultaneously,
she developed fever and watery diarrhea. CBZ was
decreased to 200 mg once daily, antihistaminic and anti-
pyretic drugs were started, which resulted in an improve-
ment of symptoms (temperature normalized, skin lesions
disappeared and diarrhea improved). The plasma CBZ
level was 3.0 mg/L (therapeutic range 4 to 12 mg/L).
Twenty days later the patient's condition dramatically
worsened. The exanthema reappeared and became gener-
alized, she developed again watery diarrhea and her tem-
perature rose to 39 degrees centigrade. She was admitted
to hospital and CBZ was replaced with valproic acid
(VPA). Laboratory findings showed a normal white blood
cell count with relative eosinophilia (8% of total leuko-
cytes) and elevated transaminases (AST of 45 U/L, ALT of
53 U/L, γGT of 65 U/L). C-reactive protein (CRP) level was
2.2 mg/dL. Serum creatinine was elevated to 1.3 mg/dl
and serum potassium level was increased at 5.5 mmol/L.
Chest x-ray and abdomen ultrasound were unremarkable,
but the electrocardiogram (ECG) showed terminal nega-
tive T waves in I, II, aVL, V5 and V6 (Fig. 1) with normaliz-
ing tendency after strain. An ischemic cardiac event was
excluded by normal myocardial scintigraphy and negative
angina history and normal troponine T and creatinine
kinase (including myocardial specific CK). Transesopha-
geal echocardiography showed no signs of myocardial
hypertrophy, a good ventricular function but a small peri-
cardial effusion. Stool cultures were negative for enteric
pathogens and no occult blood could be detected.
Following withdrawal of CBZ and application of corticos-
teroids (i.v. methylprednisolone at a dose of 16 mg daily
for one weeks) and antihistamines, the patients condition
rapidly improved, diarrhea stopped, she defeveresced and
the ECG normalized (Fig. 2).
Discussion

including rash, fever, diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes
ten days after initiation of CBZ therapy. Following tempo-
rary improvement after lowering the dose symptoms

worsened again and the patient required hospitalisation.
She had no history of drug related side effects, gastrointes-
tinal, dermatological or cardiac disorders and no apparent
acute infection making AEDHS a plausible diagnosis. The
changes in the ECG and the pericardial effusion have not
been associated with AEDHS, but we believe that either
CBZ or metabolites were directly causing these complica-
tions. Alternatively, it could be the secondary effect of
hepatic and renal involvement of AEDHS. Terminal nega-
tive T waves and pericardial effusion are unspecific symp-
toms and may be triggered by various causes. There was
no evidence for ischemia in our patient and after applica-
tion of steroids and withdrawal of CBZ these pathologies
normalized. Therefore, we believe that the cardiac pathol-
ogy was a rare manifestation of AEDHS. Of note, other
ECG changes have been previously observed after expo-
sure to CBZ and included sinus bradycardia, atrioventricu-
lar blocks and myocarditis [10]. In contrast to a previous
study from Serbia, where arrhythmia was observed in the
course of acute CBZ poisoning [11], CBZ levels were
within normal range throughout the treatment course in
our case. Therefore, we assume a rare manifestation of
AEDHS rather than cardiotoxicity in our patient. AEDHS
can present with a wide spectrum of symptoms such as
skin lesions, fever, lymphadenopathy in combination
with pathologic laboratory findings such as leucocytosis/
leucopenia and elevated liver enzymes. It has been
described after exposure to aromatic drugs such as CBZ,
phenytoin and Phenobarbital [1-6]. Onset of AEDHS may
develop one week to three months after CBZ administra-
tion [3], the term "drug rash with eosinophilia and sys-
temic symptoms" (DRESS) has been previously used
[3,12,13]. The exact mechanism of AEDHS remains to be
determined but is thought to be associated with enzy-
matic deficiency or abnormality in the metabolism of
anticonvulsants, reactivation of herpes-type viruses, and
ethnic predisposition with certain human leukocyte anti-
gen subtypes [14]. Internal organ involvement affecting
liver, lungs, lymphatic system and kidneys may lead to
misinterpretation of the symptoms [1-6]. CBZ is well
known to cause neutropenia and pancytopenia. Up to 1–
2 cases per year per 100.000 subjects may develop agran-
ulocytosis as the worst complication [15]. Individuals
with "slow liver metabolism" may be at increased risk to
develop "drug induced hypersensitivity syndrome" due to
the production of toxic metabolites in the liver even after
CBZ has been completely cleared; CBZ has also been
linked to acute liver failure. Enterocolitis may be caused
by various antiepileptic drugs [7,8]. Diagnosis of enteric
manifestation of AEDHS is based on a close temporal rela-
tionship between drug exposure and development of
diarrhea as well as improvement after withdrawal of the
causing drug like in our case. The role of glucocorticoids
in the treatment of AEDHS has been controversially dis-
cussed [3]. Glucocorticoids decrease the levels of IL-5,
which is one of the major growth factors for eosinophilic
granulocytes (especially in eosinophilic conditions). In
our patient, methylprednisolone was used, which resulted
in an improvement in all initial symptoms and normali-
zation of the previously elevated white blood cell count.
Most importantly the pericardial effusion resolved and
pathologic ECG findings (terminal negative T waves in I,
II, aVL, V5 and V6,) normalized.
