Abstract Emerging clinical data indicate that transfu-
sion-dependent patients with bone marrow-failure
syndromes (BMFS) are at risk of the consequences of iron
overload, including progressive damage to hepatic, endo-
crine, and cardiac organs. Despite the availability of
deferoxamine (DFO) in Korea since 1998, data from
patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia,
and other BMFS show signiﬁcant iron overload and dam-
age to the heart and liver. The recent introduction of
deferasirox, a once-daily, oral iron chelator, may improve
the availability of iron chelation therapy to iron-overloaded
patients, and improve compliance in patients who may
otherwise ﬁnd adherence to the DFO regimen difﬁcult.

1 Introduction
Bone-marrow-failure syndromes (BMFS) are a group of
hematopoietic stem cell disorders that can involve the
erythroid, myeloid, and/or megakaryocytic cell lines. These
conditions can arise from a genetic condition, or result
spontaneously from disease or damage to the hematopoi-
etic stem cells. The inherited BMFS include aplastic
anemia (AA), Fanconi’s anemia, dyskeratosis congenita,
and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), along with other
disorders. AA is also the most common cause of acquired
bone marrow failure [1]. In most cases of myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS) the cause is unknown, although some
cases can be linked to hematopoietic injury resulting from
previous exposure to genotoxic factors such as chemo-
therapy, radiation, and pesticides [2].
The incidence of AA is higher in Asian countries than it
is in Western countries; in Europe and the US, the age-
adjusted incidence is 2.2 per million per year, compared
with 11.0 per million per year in Japan and Korea [3].
According to a recent epidemiological survey, the inci-
dence of AA in Korean children is 4.5 per million per year,
with 4.1% occurring as congenital AA [4]. A recent ret-
rospective analysis of 50 Korean patients with MDS
showed that the most common MDS subtype was refrac-
tory anemia (RA; in 36% of patients), while the incidence
of the other subgroups were 24% for RA with excess blasts
(RAEB), 24% for RAEB in transformation, 12% for
RA with ringed sideroblasts and 2% for chronic myelo-
monocytic leukemia. The median survival of the low-,
intermediate-1-, intermediate-2-, and high-risk patients (by
international prognostic scoring system criteria) was 67.2,
27.1, 10.3, and 6.0 months, respectively [5]. The median
age of patients with MDS in Korea was reported in two
further retrospective analyses of 149 and 227 patients as 53
and 57 years, respectively [6, 7]. This is younger than the
median age of diagnosis in Western patients, measured in
the MDS Registry in Du¨sseldorf as 72 years [8].
Patients with BMFS can suffer symptomatic anemia,
which causes patients to present with fatigue, and can
adversely affect their health-related quality of life (QoL),
and cytopenia, which can be life-threatening. These symp-
toms can be managed with red blood cell (RBC)
transfusions by increasing patients’ hemoglobin levels and
thus improving their QoL. Although providing essential

supportive therapy, regular RBC transfusions can, however,
lead to iron overload. Humans have no active mechanism
for the excretion of excess iron, so patients transfused with
10–20 lifetime transfusions (20–40 RBC units; in Korea,
one RBC unit is 400 mL) can suffer the consequences of
iron overload [9], such as hypertransaminasemia and cir-
rhosis of the liver, dilated cardiomyopathy, and progressive
dysfunction of the endocrine glands [10–12].
This paper will review data highlighting the need to
monitor and treat iron-overloaded patients with AA and
MDS in Korea, the impact of iron overload on patients
receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT),
and the current clinical practices related to the treatment of
iron overload.
2 Iron overload in patients with AA and MDS
The prevalence of iron overload and organ damage in
Korean patients with AA or MDS who have a history of
RBC transfusions ([20 units) has been surveyed by the
Korean Iron Overload Study Group [13]. By February
2007, data had been collected from a cross-sectional survey
in 1,128 adult patients treated at seven university hospitals
in Korea (Table 1).
These data show that a substantial proportion (n = 331)
of patients with AA or MDS in this Korean study suffered
from iron overload (serum ferritin [1,000 ng/mL), and all
of the patients analyzed who were treated with iron che-
lation therapy with deferoxamine (DFO; DesferalÒ
) had
organ damage. In these patients, iron chelation treatment
had not been actively administered until complications
related to iron overload had appeared. Among the 331
patients who were diagnosed with iron overload, 97 also
had organ dysfunction. Table 2 summarizes the clinical
characteristics of these patients, showing that they were
heavily transfused, with a high iron burden (high serum
ferritin level) and had long duration of disease [13].
This study by the Korean Iron Overload Study Group
also showed that there was a correlation between serum
ferritin and number of transfusions, duration of transfusion
therapy and duration of transfusion dependence (Fig. 1).
In Japan, a large study retrospectively investigating data
from 292 patients with MDS and AA found that of 75
deaths, 97% were in patients who had serum ferritin levels
[1,000 ng/mL [14]. Another Japanese study in 13 patients
with AA also highlighted the dangers of iron overload in
transfusion-dependent patients. The patients who had
impaired cardiac pump function died of congestive heart
failure within 1 year of detecting abnormal ﬁndings in their
stress-velocity relation. These patients may have beneﬁted
from iron chelation therapy to reduce their myocardial iron
burden [15].
The effect of iron overload on the survival of patients
with MDS has also been studied in a retrospective analysis
of 467 patients in Italy. These data indicate that transfusion-
dependent patients had a decreased overall survival com-
pared with those who were not dependent on transfusions

(P \ 0.001; Fig. 2), and that development of iron overload
decreased overall survival (P = 0.003) [11]. This study also
demonstrated that the negative effect of iron overload on
overall survival was more prominent in patients with a good
prognosis (median survival [100 months) than in those
with a poor prognosis (median survival of approximately
50 months) [16].
3 Iron overload in patients undergoing HSCT
Patients receiving HSCT for hematologic malignancy or
BMFS commonly develop iron overload following inten-
sive supportive transfusion therapy, required following
conditioning [17]. Some patients may also have received
transfusions as supportive therapy for their BMFS prior to
the transplantation procedure. Studies outside of Korea
emerging over the last few decades have shown a signiﬁ-
cant effect of pre-transplant iron overload on survival of
sub-groups of patients with BMFS and acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) undergoing HSCT [18–20]. A case study
in a 29-year-old male Japanese patient with AA undergoing
bone marrow transplantation suggested that this patient
developed accelerated tissue damage due to iron overload
following allogeneic HSCT. The patient received 28 L of
blood prior to transplantation and 8 L after, and developed
iron overload demonstrated by large iron deposits in his
liver and stomach biopsies. The authors concluded that the
patient developed diabetes mellitus as a result of the sec-
ondary iron overload, and that there is a possibility that
tissue damage due to the iron deposits may have been
accelerated because of the HSCT [21].
In a retrospective analysis of 47 Korean children with
severe AA receiving HSCT grafts from human leukocyte
antigen-matched siblings, 30 patients had received \20
transfused RBC units, and 17 patients C20 units. Although
progressive rejections were observed in the patients who
had received C20 transfusions, there was no correlation
between transfusion volume and the incidence of graft-
versus-host disease or survival in these patients. While
these results suggest that multiple transfusions may not be
a risk factor for rejection or poor outcome, further pro-
spective investigation is needed in larger populations [22].
A US study examining the degree of hepatic iron
overload in ten patients who died 50–100 days after
receiving HSCT for various hematologic malignancies
found strong correlations between bone marrow iron con-
tent and hepatic iron index 50–100 days post transplant;

the hepatic iron index was in the range seen in patients with
hereditary hemochromatosis. The authors concluded that
an evaluation of tissue iron stores should be included in the
routine assessment of all patients after HSCT and that
effective phlebotomy or iron chelation therapy should be
offered to patients with signiﬁcant iron overload [17].
4 Assessment and treatment of iron-overloaded
patients with BMFS
Monitoring body iron levels is essential for identifying
patients who are iron overloaded and who may be potential
candidates for iron chelation therapy. Once treatment has
been initiated, iron levels should continue to be regularly
monitored to assess efﬁcacy of iron chelation therapy to
maintain iron burden below critical levels. Monitoring of
iron levels is also useful to adjust the dose of the iron
chelator to achieve the goal of therapy, whether this is
maintenance or reduction of iron burden.
4.1 Assessment of iron overload
In order to adequately manage iron overload, it is important
that body iron levels are assessed on an ongoing basis.
There are a range of techniques available to assess iron
levels, including measurement of serum ferritin levels,
liver iron concentration (LIC) by biopsy, and the use of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure hepatic and
cardiac iron concentrations [23, 24]. Serum ferritin is the
least costly and most convenient and practical of these, and
is commonly used in Korea. Levels should be monitored
regularly in patients with BMFS who are chronically
transfused. Serum ferritin levels \1,000 ng/mL are known
to be associated with a very low incidence of iron-induced
complications, while patients whose levels are [1,000 ng/
mL can suffer from cardiac, hepatic, and endocrine com-
plications of iron overload [14, 25]. LIC is a good predictor
of total body iron, and can be measured by direct bio-
chemical measurement using a needle biopsy; however, it
can lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, and
hemobilia in patients with MDS [26]. MRI indirectly
measures iron content using parameters known as T2* or
R2*, which are related to the concentration of paramag-
netic iron in the organ [26]. A Korean multicenter study on
the use of MRI to monitor patients with iron overload is
currently ongoing.
4.2 Practical use of DFO in iron-overloaded patients
To prevent the life-threatening clinical consequences of
iron overload, iron chelation therapy should be initiated in
chronically transfused patients when serum ferritin levels
reach [1,000 ng/mL [14, 27]. From 1998 until recently,
DFO was the only iron chelator available in Korea. In many
parts of the world, including Korea, DFO is administered as
an intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) infusion over 8–
24 h per day, 5–7 days/week. In Korea, some patients
receive a concomitant DFO injection during their RBC
transfusions. In Japan, it is common practice to administer
DFO fortnightly rather than nightly, and in some patients as
a bolus IV injection. Moreover, most patients in Japan
receive treatment on an outpatient basis, and infusion
pumps for DFO therapy are not reimbursed [14].
Although published data on the use of iron chelation
therapy are mostly from patients with thalassemia, data in
patients with BMFS are emerging. Recent reports from
Europe and Canada have shown a survival advantage in
transfusion-dependent patients with MDS who were ade-
quately chelated compared with those who were not [28,
29]. Other studies have found that DFO may reduce the
transfusion requirement of patients with MDS [30, 31],
while another study in 11 patients with MDS demonstrated
an improvement in erythropoietic output and a reduction in
transfusion requirement following DFO treatment [32]. A
third study in 12 multiply transfused patients with various
BMFS demonstrated induction of urinary iron excretion
and reduction in serum ferritin, liver enzyme and liver iron
levels [33]. A further study in six of the same patients with
elevated myocardial iron showed normalization of myo-
cardial iron, as estimated by MRI R2* measurements after
6–18 months of treatment with DFO [34].
In Korea, chelation therapy is not widely used for the
treatment of patients with iron overload. DFO is usually
prescribed only to patients with overt secondary hemo-
chromatosis, and is not routinely used for the prevention of
hemochromatosis. The cross-sectional survey conducted by
the Korean iron overload study group showed that only
18% of iron-overloaded patients in Korea received iron
chelation therapy [13]. Furthermore, iron-overloaded
patients with AA are more commonly administered iron
chelation therapy than those with MDS. The reluctance to
administer iron chelation therapy to patients with MDS in
Korea may stem from the advanced age of these patients,
and because some patients with poor prognosis may not
survive long enough to develop iron overload or to gain
beneﬁt from iron chelation therapy. Considerations with
administering DFO include the difﬁculty in obtaining the
required infusion pumps and the need for hospitalization.
Furthermore, DFO infusions can also have a negative
impact on patients’ QoL, as the infusions can be trouble-
some, time-consuming and painful for patients. This can be
particularly problematic in older patients as bruising may
occur at the infusion site due to decreased platelet counts or
platelet dysfunction [35].

The most common adverse events (AEs) reported fol-
lowing DFO administration are site soreness/rash, allergic
reaction to medication, breathing problems, nausea, tin-
nitus and joint or muscle pain, headache, hives, nausea,
fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain [36, 37]. In countries
where DFO is administered as an IV or SC infusion, some
of these issues can be addressed to some extent to help
increase compliance. For example, the injection site of the
therapy can be varied to decrease the likelihood of local
skin reactions, butterﬂy needles can be used, and patients
should be properly trained to ensure that SC, rather than
intradermal, infusions are achieved; patients should also
be educated about the most common AEs that might be
expected [38]. Speciﬁc AEs in patients with BMFS treated
with DFO have been noted. Four cases of development of
mucormycosis were reported in Japanese patients with AA
treated with DFO, indicating that DFO may be a risk
factor for mucormycosis in these patients [39]. Further-
more, a case of ocular toxicity was reported in an 8-year-
old patient with AA being treated with DFO in Germany
for transfusional iron overload. The ocular toxicity
improved following discontinuation of DFO for 3 months
[40].
4.3 Clinical evaluation of deferasirox
Advances in the understanding of the dangers of iron
overload and the availability of alternative iron chelation
therapies for the management of iron overload may initiate
a change in the treatment strategy for iron-overloaded
patients with BMFS in Korea. Deferasirox (ExjadeÒ
;
ICL670) is a once-daily, oral iron chelator that was laun-
ched in Korea in April 2007 for the treatment of
transfusional iron overload in pediatric and adult patients
[41], and is also approved in the USA, Europe, and many
countries worldwide.
During its clinical evaluation around the world, defer-
asirox was studied in more than 450 patients with MDS and
other BMFS [35]. Baseline data from these trials indicated
a high iron burden in transfusion-dependent patients with
MDS, DBA, AA, and Fanconi’s anemia, suggesting that,
despite the prior availability of DFO, these patients had
signiﬁcantly high levels of iron overload [35, 42, 43]. The
Catholic University of Korea took part in a 1-year, multi-
center study that enrolled patients aged C2 years with a
range of transfusion-dependent anemias, including MDS.
This study demonstrated that patients had a high baseline
serum ferritin of 2,755 ng/mL and LIC of 9.4 mg Fe/g dry
weight, indicating signiﬁcant iron burden. For the patients
who had previously been chelated, this indicates that their
treatment regimen was not providing adequate manage-
ment of their iron burden, and data clearly indicate a need
for chelation therapy in those who were chelation-naı¨ve.
One of the deferasirox core 1-year registration studies in
the US included 47 regularly transfused patients with MDS
and 30 with DBA, assigned to deferasirox dose groups
according to their baseline LIC. This study demonstrated
dose-dependent iron excretion in patients with MDS and
DBA dosed with deferasirox at 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg/day
(Fig. 3), and a statistically signiﬁcant mean decrease in
LIC of 9.9 mg Fe/g dw (±5.5; P \ 0.001) in patients
receiving 20 or 30 mg/kg/day. The study showed no evi-
dence of differences in the toxicity or tolerability between
the patients with MDS and other patients in this trial [35].
In another 3-year prospective deferasirox study in the
US enrolling 176 patients with MDS, deferasirox decreased
serum ferritin levels from a baseline of 3,398 ± 3,088 to
3,065 ± 1,743, 2,775 ± 1,355, 2,759 ± 1,562, and
2,603 ± 1,336 ng/mL at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, respec-
tively. There was also a sustained suppression of mean
labile plasma iron to the normal range after 3 months of
treatment, and a hematological improvement in ﬁve (6%)
of the patients, as deﬁned by International Working Group
criteria: three patients showed an erythroid response (one
major; two minor); two major platelet responses and one
major neutrophil response [44].
All these trials have shown that deferasirox is generally
well tolerated with a deﬁned safety proﬁle in patients with
MDS, as well as other anemias. The most common treat-
ment-related AEs included transient, mild-to-moderate
gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rash. No progressive
increases in serum creatinine were noted [45]. Treatment
with deferasirox should be initiated in patients who have
received more than 20 units of RBCs and have a serum
ferritin level [1,000 ng/mL. The recommended initial
daily dose of deferasirox is 20 mg/kg body weight, which

can be increased or decreased according to transfusional
iron intake, severity of iron overload and the therapeutic
goal of the patient, whether to maintain or decrease iron
burden [46]. Dose may be adjusted in response to rising
serum ferritin levels or emerging AEs. Dose should be
increase to 30 mg/kg when there is a 25% increase in
serum ferritin levels at two consecutive examinations. In
the case of AEs, dose should be reduced by 10 mg/kg if
there is a rise in serum creatinine of [50% from baseline,
especially in patients who are receiving concomitant
cyclosporine A. Dose should similarly be reduced in
patients who experience dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, epi-
gastric pain, and diarrhea.
The most common AEs noted from deferasirox admin-
istration are mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal disturbances
(Table 3). Diarrhea can be treated with loperamide in the
ﬁrst instance; if it is not controlled, dose should be reduced
by half. If diarrhea continues to persist, the medication
should be taken before bedtime rather than in the morning.
After the diarrhea has resolved, the patients may be re-
challenged at a lower dose of deferasirox, gradually
escalated to a full dose. Mild-to-moderate rash often
resolves spontaneously, and deferasirox may be continued
without dose adjustment. Severe skin rash can be treated by
discontinuing deferasirox and initiating prednisolone. After
the rash has resolved, the patients can be rechallenged with
a half dose deferasirox, with or without low-dose pred-
nisolone, and gradually escalated to a full dose. AEs in
pediatric patients should be managed in the same way as
adult patients. In patients undergoing treatment with
immunosuppressive therapies, deferasirox can be admin-
istered concomitantly alongside cyclosporine A. In those
with iron overload who are candidates for HSCT, defer-
asirox can be administered prior to HSCT to reduce the
patients’ iron burden.
5 Conclusions
Available guidelines from various countries for the treat-
ment of patients with MDS recommend the use of iron
chelation therapy to treat the subset of iron-overloaded
patients with good prognosis who may beneﬁt from therapy
[27, 47–50]. Despite emerging data indicating that trans-
fusion-dependent patients with BMFS, including those
receiving HSCT, are at risk of developing iron overload, as
well as the associated clinical consequences, DFO is not
routinely used for the treatment of secondary hemochro-
matosis in Korea. As the negative impact of iron overload
on the outcome of transplant recipients is understood,
intensive treatment of iron overload with deferasirox prior
to HSCT may improve survival in patients with AA or
MDS.
Deferasirox, a once-daily, oral iron chelator, has
recently been introduced in Korea. Worldwide clinical
trials in patients with BMFS have demonstrated its efﬁcacy
and tolerability in treating these patients. It is hoped that
the availability of this convenient, once-daily, oral therapy
in Korea will allow a larger number of patients to gain
beneﬁt from iron chelation therapy, and improve compli-
ance in patients who might otherwise ﬁnd the DFO
regimen difﬁcult to adhere to.
