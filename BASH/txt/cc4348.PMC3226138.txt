Objective To examine the effects of short-term cyclic stretch on
apoptosis in alveolar type II cells (A549). To study in vitro the
direct influence of alveolar type II cells on mechanical stretch.
Methods A549 were treated with different doses of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 0 ng/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml,
1000 ng/ml, and then A549 were lengthened 5%, 15%, 30% using
a FLEXCELL tension unit 4000, a vacuum-driven device that applies
strain to cells, which were cultured in six-well plates coated with
collagen-I, and 12 cycles/min for 4 hours. Apoptosis was measured
using the flow cytometry method that measures annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI) staining. The morphological changes of
apoptotic cells were observed by transmission electron microscope.
Results Apoptosis could be induced in alveolar type II cells (A549)
by mechanical stretch. The percentage of annexin V + PI cells
increased after being treated with cyclic stretch for 4 hours by 5%,
15%, 30% in all groups. The morphological features of apoptotic
cells demonstrated by transmission electron microscope were as
follows: shrinkage of the cell, chromatin condensation and
aggregation under the nuclear membrane as a crescent or lump,
membrane-encapsulated nuclear fragment or cell organ formed by
invagination of the cell membrane, and apoptotic body formation
followed by vacuolization.
Conclusion Apoptosis induced by mechanical stretch and LPS is
dose dependent. Mechanical stretch aggravates apoptosis
especially in cells treated with LPS. Annexin V and PI double
staining is a specific, sensitive, and quantitative method for
analyzing apoptotic cells. It is also helpful to clarify the protective
mechanism of low-volume ventilation in ARDS.

Introduction Although extrapulmonary ALI/ARDS is a common
clinical entity, most animal models used to study this disease are
induced by direct lung injuries. Our intention was therefore to
investigate whether a condition resembling ALI/ARDS develops
during the course of a fecal peritonitis in pigs; in that case
experimental peritonitis would also prove as a clinically relevant
ARDS model.
Methods In 10 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and
instrumented pigs fecal peritonitis was induced by inoculating
autologue feces pellets suspended in saline. Mechanical ventilation
was set with VT = 8 ml/kg, FiO2 to reach a SaO2 target of >90%,
PEEP = 10 cmH2O if PaO2/FiO2 > 300 and 12 cmH2O if
PaO2/FiO2 < 300, and respiratory rate to obtain a PaCO2 of
35–45 mmHg. Before as well as 12 and 24 hours after peritonitis
induction we measured the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, the total compliance
of the respiratory system (C), calculated as VT/(Pplateau – PEEP)
and inspiratory airway resistance (Ri) calculated as (Pmax – Pplateau) /
mean inspiratory flow. Data are mean [range].
Results For data see Table 1. During the course of the 24-hour
study period, six of 10 animals developed gas exchange
deteriorations consistent with the ARDS definition; two further
animals fulfilled the gas exchange referred to as ALI. Impairment in
lung mechanics over time is reflected by the decreasing C values.

Conclusions We conclude that an ALI/ARDS-like state is
developed by most pigs during fecal peritonitis and that this
peritonitis model may therefore serve as an extrapulmonary ARDS
model. However, this condition develops after a prolonged period
of approximately 12–18 hours, and the severity of the condition in
single animals may be less predictable when compared with ARDS
models induced by direct lung injury. Furthermore, it should be
emphasized that pulmonary function in pigs is markedly different
from humans in as much as no collateral ventilation exists in this
species [1], and that pulmonary blood flow regulation is far more
susceptible to hypoxia in pigs when compared with other species
including humans [2]. Lung function data derived from pig models
should therefore always be interpreted cautiously if clinically
relevant conclusions have to be drawn.

Introduction Tight blood glucose (BG) control has been shown to
decrease morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients [1] but is
difficult to achieve using standard insulin infusion protocols. We
evaluated glucose control, using a software model predictive
control (MPC) insulin administration algorithm, in a prospective
randomized controlled multicenter comparison with standard care in
three European hospitals (Royal Brompton Hospital [RBH], Medical
University Graz [MUG], Charles University Hospital [CUP]).
Methods Sixty ventilated patients (20 in each center) admitted to
intensive care following elective cardiac surgery, with an arterial BG
> 6.7 mmol/l within 4 hours of admission, were randomized to BG
control by the standard insulin protocol of the participating ICU or
MPC advised insulin infusion. All patients had BG measured hourly.
Standard care (n = 30) involved insulin infusion in two centers
(RBH, CUP) and insulin boluses in the third (MUG). The MPC
algorithm was derived from software developed for closed loop
glucose control in ambulatory diabetic patients [2]. MPC, installed
on a bedside computer, requires input of patient chronic insulin
requirements, weight, carbohydrate intake and BG concentration.
Insulin infusion rate advice for the next hour is displayed, targeted to
maintain BG at 4.4–6.1 mmol/l. The study was continued for at
least 24 hours with a maximum duration of 48 hours.
Results The percentage of glucose measurements in the target
range were significantly greater in the MPC group over the first
24 hours compared with standard care: 52% (17–92) vs 19%
(0–71), (median [min–max]), P < 0.01. Two hypoglycemic events
(BG < 3 mmol/l) occurred in patients receiving standard care.
Conclusion The MPC algorithm was safe and effective in
controlling postoperative hyperglycaemia in this patient group.

Introduction In the frame of protective lung ventilation, alveolar
biomechanics become more and more the focus of scientific
interest. New microscopic techniques and experimental setups
enabled a view of the alveoli dynamically changing their geometry
under mechanical ventilation [1]. Although of fascinating image
quality the alveoli are observed at an open chest wall under a glass
plate representing an artificial situation. To circumvent this
restriction we developed a method of intravital endoscopy and
tested it on an animal rat model.
Methods In cooperation with Schoelly GmbH (Denzlingen,
Germany) we developed an endoscope with an outer tube diameter
of 2.7 mm (including the optical fiber). To prevent the alveoli under
observation from mechanical deformation due to the tip of the
endoscope we developed a flushing catheter that continuously
produces a thin fluid film between the endoscope tip and the alveoli
being in the optical focus. The endoscope tube can be introduced
by minimally invasive thoracotomy, thus enabling microscopic
videos of the alveolar dynamics. The thorax remains intact.
Results Figure 1 shows a tissue area after lavage of 0.8 mm
diameter. This region is displayed at different time points during a
breath. Four snapshots were taken in inspiration (upper row) and
four in expiration (lower row). In the middle of the figure the
corresponding P–V loop (left) and the intratidal dynamic
compliance (right) are shown.
Conclusion This new minimal invasive method of intravital
endoscopy enables microscopic observations of the mechanical
alveolar dynamics in situ. The concurrent observation of respiratory
mechanics and alveolar dynamics provides a promising tool to
correlate global measurements with local alveolar properties.

Influence of the blood on the time course of pancreatitis-
induced lung injury evaluated in isolated blood-perfused
rat lungs

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P5 (doi:10.1186/cc4352)
We evaluated the time course of pancreatitis-induced lung injury
using an isolated blood-perfused rat lung preparation with lungs
harvested 2, 6 or 18 hours after pancreatitis induced by injecting
taurocholic acid into the pancreatic duct. This allowed us to
separate and to determine the specific role of pancreatic blood vs
normal blood on the expression of injury evidenced during isolated
lung reperfusion. After 6 hours of pancreatitis (but not after 2 or
18 hours despite similar elevated serum amylase concentrations
and persisting evidence of systemic inflammation) lung reperfusion

with autologous blood or with homologous blood collected from
normal rats revealed lung endothelial cell injury manifested by the
formation of progressive lung oedema (~1 g/hour) accompanied
by alterations in dynamic and static lung mechanics resulting in a
final increased wet-to-dry lung weight ratio (7.5 ± 0.6; P < 0.01 vs
control or time-matched sham-operated animals). In contrast,
reperfusing normal lungs with pancreatic blood collected from rats
6 hours after taurocholate injection did not produce any alterations
in lung weight and dynamic or static lung mechanics compared
with normal control lungs. However, pancreatic blood collected
2 hours after taurocholate injection produced a moderate alteration
in lung function but without significant increase in the wet-to-dry
lung weight ratio (5.4 ± 0.5). Our results indicate that in this acute
rat pancreatitis model lung injury occurred early, between 2 and
6 hours, and was completely reversible despite persistent elevated
amylase concentration and systemic inflammation. Isolated lung
reperfusion with normal homologous blood did not modify the
expression of the pancreatic in-vivo-induced lung injury. Further-
more, pancreatic blood collected early (after 2 hours, but not after
6 hours) and used as perfusate for normal isolated lungs produced
mild lung oedema and a moderate increase in dynamic lung
compliance, suggesting that its potential toxic effects on the lungs
were completely neutralized after 6 hours of pancreatitis.

Rats surviving after high tidal volume ventilation show
marked and reversible pulmonary and systemic changes

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P6 (doi:10.1186/cc4353)
Rationale High tidal volume (VT) ventilation (HTVV) induces
pulmonary inflammation. The time course of pulmonary and
systemic HTVV-induced vascular dysfunction is unknown. We
tested whether rats receiving HTVV survive the insult, and we
describe the time-course of the HTVV-induced vascular changes.
Methods Normal anesthetized Sprague–Dawley rats were
tracheostomized and ventilated for 1 hour with either VT = 9 ml/kg +
PEEP 5 cmH2O, or VT = 35 ml/kg + ZEEP. After the HTVV period, the
tracheostomy was closed, and rats were sent back to their cages
breathing room air. Other rats were sacrificed at this point in time (t =
1 hour). Rats surviving the acute period of HTVV were again intubated,
monitored and then sacrificed at different points in time (24 hours,
72 hours, 168 hours). We measured the mean arterial pressure, aortic
blood flow (QAo), arterial blood gases, and total protein, AST, ALT,
IL-6, and VEGF serum and BAL fluid concentrations. Aortic segments
and pulmonary micro vessels were mounted in myographs, and
responses to acetylcholine in norepinehrine-precontracted rings were
tested. Histological lung changes were studied.
Results All lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage after HTVV at 1
and 24 hours, but histology was completely normal at t = 72 hours.
HTVV induced hypotension, decreased QAo, hypoxemia,
increased protein, AST, ALT, IL-6, and VEGF BAL fluid/serum
concentration ratio. Acetylcholine and norephineprine-induced
responses were impaired after HTVV in aortic rings. Moreover
acetylcholine-induced responses in pulmonary microvessels were
impaired. All these biochemical and vascular function changes
normalized at t = 168 hours.
Conclusions About half the rats receiving for a short period of time
ventilation using very high VT survive. HTVV induces in a reversible
fashion pulmonary and systemic inflammation and vascular
dysfunction.

Introduction The individualization of lung protective ventilation
strategies (e.g. recruitment maneuvers [RM] and PEEP titration to
keep the lungs open) requires careful bedside observations. Many
parameters must be monitored, which calls for computer aid. A
fuzzy-logic ventilation expert system has been tested regarding its

ability to automatically conduct RMs based on the open lung
concept (OLC).
Methods Three pigs received lavages to induce ARDS and
baseline ventilation of 8 ml/kg Vt, RR = 25, I:E = 1:1 and FiO2 = 1.0.
The block diagram of the ventilation setup is depicted in Fig. 1a. It
is capable of conducting automatic RMs while continuously
recording pulmonary parameters. Fuzzy controllers handle the four
phases of OLC-RM. They were fed with medical knowledge from
experienced physicians. An electrical impedance tomograph (EIT)
provided images of the ventilation distribution and CT scans were
made. During phase 1 of RM, the controller increased the PEEP
level (PCV, Pdelta = 8 cmH2O) until the lung was supposed to be
open according to online PaO2 measurements (Paratrend 7). In the
closing phase 2, PEEP was automatically titrated until PaO2
started to decrease. After re-opening, steady-state ventilation
(phase 4) was established at a PEEP = 2 cmH2O above the
closing pressure.
Results The pulmonary parameters of one pig during an RM cycle
can be seen in Fig. 1b. After 20 min, PaO2, Vt and compliance Crs
(= Pdelta/Vt) were significantly increased in all animals and PaCO2
reduced to normal values. Phases 1–3 of the RM process lasted
approximately 5 min, partially due to the dynamic latency (15 s) of
the PaO2 measurement system. An optimization of the fuzzy
controller and additional sensors will shorten the execution time
and reduce the heart’s pressure load. Figure 1c shows the CT and
EIT images before and after RM. Atelectases are removed and
ventilation is increased, more evenly distributed and shifted from
ventral to dorsal regions.
Conclusion Automatic RM with a sustained improvement of PaO2
and Crs could be achieved. The EIT showed a high potential to
visualize and assess RM with a high temporal resolution.

Introduction Assessment of regional alveolar recruitment and
derecruitment during protective respiratory therapy in lung failure is
necessary to predict the process of ventilatory therapy and to avoid
pulmonary complications. Different studies showed that clinical
management of ARDS can successfully be controlled by CT scan
analysis [1]. Information about regional distribution of ventilation
can also be assessed by the bedside method of electrical
impedance tomography (EIT) [2]. To correlate the assessment of
pulmonary recruitment with EIT and CT scans as a reference
technique during a PEEP trial, we designed an experimental study
with porcine saline-lavage-induced lung injury.
Methods In six pigs (25–34 kg), acute lung injury was induced by
repetitive lung-lavage. After stabilisation of the lung injury model
(> 1 hour) a stepwise PEEP trial with 2 min at each pressure ramp
was performed (10 up to 30 mbar and 30 down to 5 mbar) with an
electrically controllable ventilator (Servo 300; Siemens-Elema).
During the PEEP trial, the animals were ventilated with pressure-
controlled ventilation (delta 8 mbar), respiratory rate (RR) 25,
I:E 1:1 and FiO2 1.0. Ventilatory, hemodynamic and gas exchange
parameters were continuously recorded during the stepwise PEEP
trial. EIT measurements were realized at a juxtadiaphragmatic
thoracic level. Simultaneously, a CT scanner was triggered to
obtain reference images of the same slice for each PEEP level at
the end of each pressure ramp. Three ROI in nondependent,
middle and dependent lung areas were defined to compare the EIT
data with the reference data of the CT slices. The correlation
between the changes in air content between both methods was
determined. To compare the amount of pulmonary recruitment/
derecruitment at each PEEP level expressed by CT (Hounsfield
units) measurement and relative impedance changes, the effect
size (ES) [3] was calculated. ES levels were defined: small: <0.2,
medium: 0.2–0.5, high: >0.8.
Results The measured tidal volumes and PaO2 clearly showed a
nonlinear lung hysteresis and recruitment of nonaerated lung areas
at the descending part of the pressure ramp (Fig. 1). The highest
but not significant correlation between EIT measurements and
X-ray attenuation (HU) was found in the dependent lung areas. The
effect of PEEP on pulmonary recruitment/derecruitment was very
high at lower pressure levels. The display of pulmonary recruitment
in the EIT in comparison with CT scans at the ascending part of the
pressure ramp showed a higher ES. ES values were reduced in
EIT, if the tidal volume was reduced (Table 1).

Introduction The computed tomography (CT) scan can be used to
measure the lung weight–volume and to determine the degree of
inflation (not aerated, poorly aerated, well aerated, over aerated
tissue). Nowadays to accurately study the lung, a whole thoracic CT
scan must be performed, thus exposing the patient to a large dose of
ionizing radiation. A possible solution could be to acquire only three
CT lung sections instead of scanning the whole lung. We previously
showed that in ALI/ARDS patients three lung sections are able to
accurately estimate the lung inflation similar to the whole CT scan.
Objective To evaluate whether three lung sections gives
comparable data to the whole lung CT analysis in patients with
unilateral pneumonia.
Materials and methods Thirty-two patients with unilateral
pneumonia were studied (mean age 64.2 ± 20.4 years, 18 males,
BMI 25.4 ± 2.8 kg/m2, PaO2/FiO2 261.1 ± 102.8, SAPS-II
35.3 ± 16.8, 14 mechanically ventilated). Each patient underwent
a whole lung spiral CT scan. The lung regions of interest were
manually delineated on each CT slice, using dedicated software
(MALUNA; University of Mannheim, Germany). The three CT lung
sections were selected at the level of the aortic arch, carina and at
the mid right atrium (representing the lung apex, hilum and base).
Lung quantitative analysis was performed with specific software
(SOFT-E-FILM; University of Milan). The agreement between the
two methods was evaluated using Bland–Altman analysis
considering each compartment of lung inflation (expressed as the
percentage of the total weight).
Results For the nonaerated tissue the mean of the difference ± 2SD
was 0.015 ± 0.096, poorly aerated was 0.011 ± 0.056, well
aerated – 0.025 ± 0.084 and over aerated – 0.001 ± 0.014.
Conclusions Our data show that a lung CT scan of only three
sections can provide comparable information on the distribution of
lung inflation as a whole lung CT scan.

Objective Computed tomography (CT) is used in the diagnostic
management of polytraumatized patients. Multiple trauma and
pulmonary contusion are typical triggers of post-traumatic acute
lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
[1]. Therefore, an early predictor of post-traumatic ALI/ARDS
would be valuable. In this study we tested whether the mass of
nonaerated lung tissue (Mnon) in admission CT could predict post-
traumatic ALI/ARDS.
Methods The Mnon of 54 polytraumatized patients with pulmonary
contusion was analyzed as previously described [2]. We studied
the association of Mnon with physiologic variables and injury
descriptors such as PaO2/FiO2 ratio, injury severity score (ISS)
and thoracic trauma severity score (TTSS) [3] recorded on
admission. To evaluate Mnon as a predictor of ALI/ARDS we used
a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve.
Results Patients developing post-traumatic ALI/ARDS had
significantly larger Mnon and significantly higher ISS and TTSS
values. Literature data suggest a higher incidence of ALI/ARDS
with a contusioned lung volume >20% [4]. Our results, however,
indicate a higher risk of ALI/ARDS already with a Mnon of around
10%. The Mnon predicting ALI/ARDS with the highest sensitivity
(81%) and specificity (87%) was 9.8%. The area under the ROC
curve was 0.89 (confidence interval 0.79–0.99).
Conclusion The mass of nonaerated lung tissue on admission CT
can help to predict the development of ALI/ARDS. It may thereby
help to implement appropriate therapeutic options such as lung
protective ventilation. The clinical use of our technique, however, is
limited by the time-consuming CT analysis.

Introduction Recruitment plays a major role in defining the sigmoid
shape of the static pressure–volume (PV) curve in ARDS. The
injured lung is at risk of atelectasis due to surfactant dysfunction
and due to increased superimposed pressure caused by increased
lung weight. In normal lungs, however, alveoli are much more stable
than in the injured lung. Therefore, it is not clear to what extent
recruitment defines the shape of the PV curve in normal lungs. We
hypothesized that resolving atelectasis using a recruitment
maneuver leads to typical changes in the shape of the PV curve.
Methods After induction of anesthesia and oral intubation, six
sheep were mechanically ventilated in a prone position. Data
acquisition was performed using an Evita4Lab measurement
system (Draeger Medical, Lübeck, Germany). The protocol
consisted of a low flow inflation maneuver (LF1), followed by a
recruitment maneuver (RM) and a second low flow inflation (LF2).
Before LF1 and between interventions, animals were ventilated at
ZEEP for 5 min. The shape of the static PV curves during LF1 and
LF2 and the shape of the dynamic PV curves during ventilation at
ZEEP were analyzed.
Results During LF1 a sudden incline (INC) in the static PV curve
was observed in all animals. Due to the incline, the curves were not
compatible with the sigmoid approximation according to Venegas
Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/10/S1
S6
and colleagues. The sudden incline had disappeared in LF2 (Fig. 1).
The shape of the dynamic PV curves and dynamic compliance
were changed by LF1. Afterwards dynamic compliance remained
unchanged irrespective of 5-min ZEEP and of the RM (Fig. 2).
Conclusion In normal sheep lungs, recruitment does influence the
shape of the static PV curve. Other than in ARDS, the presence of
recruitment does not generate a sigmoid PV curve. The changes in
dynamic compliance after a RM were preserved for at least 5 min,
indicating a long-lasting effect. The effects of recruitment on the
shape of the PV curve might serve as diagnostic tool to
differentiate normal patients from patients at risk of lung injury.

Introduction The clinical use of respiratory mechanics is limited
due to complicated measurement methods and restricted bedside
availability of the achievable information. For observational and
interventional studies in the ICUs of the university clinics of
Freiburg we developed a laptop-based tool, which provides online
information about the mechanical state of the patient’s respiratory
system on a breath by breath basis.
Methods We developed a program in LabView (National
Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) on a laptop that is able to read the
internal data of a ventilator (Evita 4; Dräger Medical, Lübeck,
Germany) in real time. A serial connection is established using the
MEDIBUS protocol. Pressure, flow and volume provided by the
ventilator are read into the laptop at 125 Hz, analyzed and
visualized. The signal analysis provides dynamic compliance and
resistance in dependence of alveolar pressure [1,2]. Statistics and
trends are displayed on request of the user.
Active manipulations of the settings of the ventilator are possible
and were used for animal experiments. With appropriate
maneuvers (by controlling the volume/time or pressure/time curve)
it is possible to derive mechanical properties of the respiratory
system separated according to inspiration and expiration.
Results In an animal (n = 6) and an observational patient (n = 30)
study at University Hospital Freiburg the system was evaluated.

experiment performed on healthy anesthetized sheep. Trends are

visualized by overlaying older data in different colors with actual
data. The physician gets immediate feedback on whether changes
of ventilator settings show the expected effects.
Conclusion Online monitoring of respiratory mechanics provides
additional information about changes in the state of a patient’s
respiratory system. Thus the physician is enabled to evaluate the
therapeutic strategy online and to base the settings of the
ventilator on current trends observed in the data.

Introduction ARDS is a difficult to treat disease and is associated
with a high mortality. For lung protective ventilation strategies the
interaction of ventilator settings and respiratory mechanics is
essential. In the past the static PV curve was used to determine
ventilator settings in ARDS patients. Atelectasis was assumed to
occur at pressures below the lower inflection point (LIP). This
study was performed to investigate the influence of ventilatory
patterns with different tidal volumes (Vt) on the shape of the static
PV curve.
Methods After induction of anesthesia and tracheotomy, 14
surfactant-depleted piglets were ventilated at ZEEP with three
different Vt (8, 12, 16 ml/kg) in a randomised order. For data
acquisition a BICORE CP100 monitor (Bicore Monitoring
Systems, Irvine, CA, USA) was used. The protocol consisted of a
static maneuver at the end of each ventilator setting. In addition a
baseline measurement (12 ml/kg) was performed before saline
lavage. At the end of each setting a recruitment maneuver was
performed before Vt change. After determining the LIPs their
corresponding pressure values were compared using ANOVA and
the Fisher PLSD post-hoc test.
Results Figure 1 shows the pressure belonging to the LIP
(mean ± SD) prelavage and postlavage with different Vt. In healthy
lungs the LIP is located at lower pressures than after surfactant
depletion. Postlavage the pressure at LIP increases significantly
with increasing Vt.
Conclusion The analysis of static respiratory mechanics shows
interdependence between the ventilator settings prior to the static
maneuver and the LIP. This could be interpreted as an effect of
volume history on the relative position of the LIP. As we observed
this effect despite standardisation of the maneuver itself the value
of the current interpretation of static measurements has to be
questioned.

Introduction Vibration response imaging (VRI) is a novel
technology that measures vibration energy generated from airflow
to create a real-time structural and functional image of the
respiration process. Since this new imaging technique can be
performed quickly and non-invasively at the bedside, it offers
potential as a real time noninvasive method of adjusting ventilatory
therapy.
Case A 75-year-old male patient was admitted to the ICU with
acute lung injury due to acute pancreatitis and was mechanically
ventilated with a PEEP setting of 5 mmHg and FiO2 1.0. VRI
recordings were obtained before and after a recruitment maneuver
(40 cmH2O PEEP for 40 s) and increasing PEEP to 10 cmH2O.
Images were taken during 20-s periods of respiration and
respiratory cycles for analysis selected based on predefined
selection rules. Mechanical ventilator settings were the same
before and after recruitment. The total areas were measured by
using the Image-J program (Table 1). Arterial blood gases were
obtained immediately before and after recruitment and in close
proximity (within 1 min) of VRI (Table 2). Statistical analysis was
performed using a t test. Figures 1 and 2 show representative
images before and after recruitment and PEEP elevation.
Discussion This case demonstrates a significant increase in the
geographical area of vibration response images at peak inspiration
after recruitment maneuver and a PEEP increase in early ARDS.
This increase in VRI area correlates with improvement in oxygenation.
Conclusion Increased spatial distribution of ventilation following
effective recruitment has previously been demonstrated using
computerized tomography. VRI may provide a rapid bedside

Aim The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of
respiratory system inertance (Irs) on the linearity of respiratory
mechanics during mechanical ventilation (MV) under conventional
frequencies.
Methods Airway pressure (Pao), flow (V′) and volume (V) were
recorded from 11 ARDS patients under MV at 10 and 20 c/min.
Data were analyzed according to: Pao = EEP + Ers.V + Rrs.V′ and
Pao = EEP + Ers.V + Rrs.V′ + Irs.V′′, where Ers and Rrs are the
respiratory system elastance and resistance, and EEP is the end-
expiratory pressure. The fitness of data to models was evaluated by
the standard error of the regressions (RMSD). Comparisons
between all coefficients were done at 10 and at 20 c/min with the
aid of the Wilcoxon rank test (P < 0.05).
Results and conclusions The mean values ± SD of all coefficients
are presented in Table 1. Irs did not differ significantly between 10
and 20 c/min. The use of the inertive term results in a significantly
higher Ers, lower Rrs and lower RMSD (P < 0.001) at both
frequencies, but these differences are clinically irrelevant. We
conclude that Irs is not negligible during MV in ARDS. Respiratory
pathophysiology and the ventilator characteristics may contribute
to the important role of Irs during MV.

Is PEEP detrimental to splanchnic perfusion in
mechanically ventilated patients?

Objective Disturbances in splanchnic perfusion leads to
insufficiency of the gut mucosal barrier. As a consequence it
causes bacterial translocation that might be a trigger to septic
shock and multiorgan failure. The present study was designed to
assess whether mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory
pressure (PEEP) is a factor disturbing cardiac output and
splanchnic perfusion. Gastric intramucosal PCO2 (PiCO2) and pH
(pHi) are currently used as indices of the accuracy of splanchnic
perfusion and as end points to guide therapeutic intervention. The
definition of the ideal PEEP does not include improvement in
oxygen delivery and its accessibility in the splanchnic region.
Design A prospective study.
Setting Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care of
Medical Postgraduate Education Center, Warsaw, Poland.
Patients Twenty adult ICU patients after laparotomy (hemicolec-
tomy, colectomy) (group A) and five nonsurgical ICU patients
(group B). All of them did not have serious respiratory and
circulatory abnormalities, and did not need adrenergic or any
circulatory support. All were mechanically ventilated under sedation
with PEEP 0, PEEP 5, PEEP 10, PEEP 15. Each patient ventilated
with PEEP 0 was a control for himself/herself. Each ventilation
setting period lasted 1 hour. All the measurements were performed
twice during that time.
Measurements and results PiCO2–PaCO2, pH–pHi, CI, CVP,
ITBVI, EVLWI were measured using gastric tonometry and the
PiCCO method (pulse contour cardiac output) after each change
of PEEP value. No differences in pH–pHi and PiCO2–PaCO2 were
observed between groups A and B. PEEP does not compromise
gastric mucosal perfusion, as assessed by tonometry. Even the
patient’s age was not essential. A decrease in cardiac output did
not result in necessity of adrenergic support. Only in one case

there was a need to use it for more than 1 hour after setting PEEP
10. Mean values of CI were higher in group A compared with
nonoperated group B. CI depends on the age and PEEP level.
CVP was increased by PEEP in both groups, but ITBVI was almost
untouched, the right ventricle preload did not decrease, and
EVLWI was slightly lowered under PEEP 15. IAP did not exceed
10 mmHg in any case.
Conclusions PEEP up to 15 cmH2O is well tolerated by the
majority of ICU patients. The results of the present study indicate
that incremental increases in PEEP do not impact on splanchnic
perfusion as assessed by gastric tonometry in patients with
adequate fluid loading. In some cases a necessity for adrenergic
support might appear. Facing the fact of nonaffecting splanchnic
perfusion, we cannot recommend any PEEP value as ideal for
perfusing that region. More studies are needed in this area,
particularly in patients receiving adrenergic support.

Separate determination of inspiratory and expiratory
dynamic lung mechanics using expiratory flow control

Introduction During mechanical ventilation, the volume-dependent
mechanical behaviour of the respiratory system may differ between
inspiration and expiration due to expiratory collapse of small airways
and due to repeated intratidal recruitment. Up to now, no method is
available for separate determination of inspiratory and expiratory
resistance (R) and compliance (C) during mechanical ventilation.
We hypothesized that the control of the expiratory flow rate
(expiratory flow control [EFC]) allows a discrete analysis of R and C.
Methods Different flow profiles were applied in two mechanical
lung models. These profiles included standard ventilator and EFC
modes. The volume dependency of dynamic respiratory mechanics
was calculated using the SLICE method [1]. The algorithm was
extended for a separate analysis of the inspiration and expiration
phase. We validated the efficacy of EFC in six sheep using a
modified standard ventilator (Evita 4; Draeger Medical, Lübeck,
Germany) with EFC in the pressure-control mode.
Results It is mainly the passive expiration with the linear
dependency of flow, volume and pressure that inhibits the separate
inspiratory and expiratory analysis of respiratory mechanics.
Figure 1 shows the effect of EFC on the breathing pattern in a
healthy animal. At early expiration with EFC, flow is drastically
reduced as compared with passive expiration (grey line). With EFC
(solid line), the change in flow is independent of the change in
volume, allowing the determination of R and C. Figure 2 displays
the analysis of compliance in a lung model (C = 24) during
constant flow ventilation without EFC. Without EFC, expiratory
compliance is indeterminable (solid line). With EFC (Fig. 3)
excellent agreement of inspiratory and expiratory compliance with
the reference compliance was found. In six healthy sheep
compliance determined during EFC was computed in inspiration
and expiration. Dependent on the extent of EFC, we found a high
agreement of inspiratory and expiratory compliances compared
with mixed (inspiratory and expiratory) data.
Conclusion The control of expiratory flow allows the application of
volume-dependent multiple linear regression analysis during
inspiration respectively expiration alone. With EFC, the separate
mechanical analysis reveals accurate results in well-controlled
mechanical lung models and in experimental animals.

The course of the oxygenation index before kinetic therapy
or prone ventilation is decisive for the prognosis of acute
respiratory failure

Introduction In acute respiratory failure (ARF), in particular acute
lung injury (ALI) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an
intervention in the form of rotational therapy (RT) or the prone
position (PP) may improve oxygenation by recruiting alveoli
situated in dorsal-dependent regions and by alteration of the
ventilation/perfusion ratio. The efficacy of this interventions can be
demonstrated among other parameters by the course of the
oxygenation index. The aim of our study is to analyze the
prognostic value of the course of the oxygenation index before and
after such an intervention.
Methods We studied 112 mechanically ventilated patients (mean
age 63 ± 15.6 [SE] years) with an ARF (ARDS n = 69; ALI n = 43)

at a surgical ICU in a university hospital using the American–
European consensus definition in a clinical follow-up design, who
received supportive therapy either with RT (n = 52; Rotorest®) or
using PP (n = 60; 135° left/right-side position for at least 6 hours
in each position). The physicians on duty had the freedom of
choice to use one or other method guided by their clinical
experience and judgement. Data collection included, apart from
baseline characteristics, individual PAO2/FiO2 of patients in the
course 64 hours before and 120 hours after intervention. The
individual PAO2/FiO2 before and after intervention was compared
with linear regression analysis for each group (linear regression
procedure and t test, SPSS®).
Results The mean PAO2/FiO2 decreased within 64 hours until the
intervention from 230 ± 91 to 178 ± 59 mmHg in all patients
(mean ± SE). Patients who died (n = 64) showed a more rapid
deterioration of PAO2/FiO2 during conventional ventilation in the
supine position in the interval of 64 hours prior to intervention in
the form of RT or PP (slope of regression straight line: RT –5.14;
PP –7.14) in comparison with patients who survived their acute
respiratory failure (slope RT –3.43; PP –0.57) within the scope of
the critical illness (P < 0.05). Nearly all patients showed a more or
less marked improvement of PAO2/FiO2 during the first 5 days
after intervention (PAO2/FiO2 after 120 hours: RT group
184 ± 77.28; PP group 213 ± 75 mmHg; y [all patients] =
3.9045*X + 234.61], but there was no significant difference in the
linear regression analysis between survivors (slope of regression
straight line: RT 0.28; PP 2.48) and nonsurvivors (RT 0.61;
PP 2.03) during 120 hours after the intervention.
Conclusion The course of PAO2/FiO2 seems to be more decisive
for the prognosis of patients with an evolving ARF than the course
after supportive interventions such as RT or PP. In patients with a
rapid deterioration of PAO2/FiO2 we should be aware that this may
indicate an unfavourable prognosis in the sequel. Supportive
measures such as RT or PP, which aim to treat the ventilation/
perfusion heterogenity, both seem to work, and therefore should
be used in the early phase of ARF to reduce aggravation of lung
injury and complications of mechanical ventilation.

respiratory distress syndrome

Background In the past few years there has been a resurgence of
interest in high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), as part of
the search for lung-protective ventilation in acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). The prone position has been used
increasingly as a simple and safe method to improve oxygenation in
conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV), but only occasionally
as adjunctive therapy in HFOV.
Objective To evaluate safety and results when using both HFOV
and the prone position in adult patients in the early phase of severe
ARDS as integrated therapy for alternative lung-protective ventilation.
Methods Adult patients diagnosed with ARDS resulting from a
pulmonary cause (ARDSp) and from an extrapulmonary cause
(ARDSe) receiving mechanical ventilation for less than 72 hours,
when it is not possible for a conventional lung-protective strategy
of low tidal volumes (≤ 6 ml/kg PBW) and limited inspiratory
plateau pressures (≤ 30cmH2O), requiring FiO2 ≥ 0.6 to keep
PaO2 ≥ 60 mmHg or SpO2 ≥ 90% with moderate–high levels of
PEEP in CMV and the prone position. Data are presented as the
mean ± SD.
Results We included in the study seven consecutive critically ill
patients with early ARDS, four men and three women (five
ARDSp/two ARDSe), aged 46.3 ± 20 years. APACHE-II score:
28.1 ± 4.8. LIS: 3.7 ± 0.2. OI: 35.6 ± 18.1. PaO2/FiO2: 88.6 ±
39.2. Patients were ventilated in the prone position and CMV with
FiO2: 0.84 ± 0.2. Tidal volume: 6 ± 0.3 ml/kg PBW. Plateau
pressure: 34.3 ± 2.1 cmH2O. Mean airway pressure: 25.9 ± 3.8
and PEEP: 17.1 ± 3.6 cmH2O.
The patients were switched to HFOV in the prone position as
alternative lung-protective ventilation. It was possible to apply
higher mean airway pressures than in CMV and the prone position,
to achieve significant and sustained improvements in gas exchange
(PaO2/FiO2) and reductions in FiO2 requirements in the first 24
hours of HFOV without hemodynamic instability or barotrauma.
Patients were turned back to the supine position in HFOV (mean
time in prone position: 3.1 ± 1.5 days) before transition to CMV
(mean time in HFOV: 5.6 ± 3.2 days).
Two patients died in the first 2 days after being switched to HFOV,
due to fulminant sepsis in Gram-negative bacteraemia and to
massive alveolar haemorrhage in lupus, respectively. The other five
patients were discharged alive from the ICU without ventilatory
support. They are alive 3 months after diagnosis and treatment of
ARDS.
Conclusions It is possible to use lung-protective ventilation using
HFOV and the prone position as adjunctive therapy, with good
outcomes in adult patients in the early phase of severe ARDS
without significant complications. In our experience, it would be
interesting to evaluate in future studies whether HFOV and the
prone position is a better approach to lung protective ventilation
than CMV for the most severe ARDS adult patients.

Objective To evaluate the efficacy of high-frequency oscillatory
ventilation (HFOV) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
in adult patients.
Setting A 30-bed medical and surgical ICU of a tertiary care
hospital.
Design A prospective clinical study over a period of 12 months.
Methods ARDS patients receiving mechanical ventilation as per
the ARDSnet protocol and requiring positive end expiratory
pressure (PEEP) ≥ 12 cmH2O and FiO2 ≥ 0.7 to maintain oxygen
saturation ≥88% were considered for HFOV. Initial settings of
HFOV were selected based upon the mean airway pressure
(MAP), PO2/FiO2 ratio, PCO2 and oxygenation index (OI) (OI =
MAP × FiO2 × 100 / PO2). Predetermined protocols for HFOV
adjustments and weaning from HFOV were implemented.
Continuous hemodynamic, plethysmographic monitoring was
performed. Arterial blood gas parameters were documented at 1, 6
and 24 hours after initiation of HFOV.
Results A total of 18 patients were ventilated with HFOV for 80.82 ±
58.70 hours. Baseline characteristics before initiation of HFOV
were: APACHE II score 21.11 ± 4.65, hours of conventional
ventilation 61.83 ± 52.77, PEEP of 14.16 ± 3.7 cmH2O, plateau
pressure (Pplat) of 29.44 ± 4.93 cm, FiO2 of 0.89 ± 0.11 and
average ≥ 3 organs failure. There was an improvement in
oxygenation status at 6 and 24 hours. The PO2/FiO2 ratio

S11
increased from a baseline of 97.47 ± 27.92 to 181.26 ± 110.37
and 256.41 ± 130.85 at 6 and 24 hours, respectively. The OI
reduced from a baseline of 26 ± 10.98 to 23.59 ± 16.98 and
15.95 ± 12.38 at 6 and 24 hours, respectively. Out of 18 patients
13 were ‘Responders’ — i.e. showed progressive and sustained
improvement in oxygenation and were successfully weaned to ‘T’
piece oxygen (≥12 hours without any ventilatory assistance). The
remaining five were ‘Non Responders’ and did not show sustained
improvement in oxygenation and died of resistant hypoxia.
Subgroup analysis The Responder (n = 13) and Non Responder
(n = 5) groups were similar in Pre HFOV baseline characteristics
such as age, APACHE II score, number of organs failed, Pplat,
PO2/FiO2 ratio and OI. The PO2/FiO2 ratios at 6 hours were
208.81 ± 110.96 vs 109.61 ± 77.41 (P = 0.04) in Responders
and Non Responders, respectively. PO2/FiO2 ratios at 24 hours
were 290.78 ± 117.43 vs 167.05 ± 132.58 (P = 0.03) in
Responders and Non Responders, respectively. The reduction in
OI in the Responder group at 6 and 24 hours was significant as
compared with Non Responders: 17.27 ± 8.37 vs 40.01 ± 23.42
at 6 hours (P = 0.003) and 11.17 ± 4.28 vs 28.36 ±18.16 at 24
hours (P = 0.002). One patient developed pneumothorax and one
patient had endotracheal tube displacement while on HFOV.
Conclusion HFOV is effective in adult patients with severe ARDS
failing conventional ventilation. Progressive and sustained improve-
ment in the PO2/FiO2 ratio and the reduction in the OI at 6 and 24
hours are strongly associated with successful response to HFOV.

Introduction High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)
theoretically provides the ideal mode of ventilation for patients with
acute lung injury. By avoiding repeated recruitment and de-
recruitment of lung units it has the potential to reduce ventilator-
associated lung injury. In the vast majority of centres, however, it is
still only used as rescue therapy for patients failing conventional
ventilation (CV). In our 29-bed university hospital ITU we maintain a
registry of patients receiving HFOV, and the first 25 entries are
presented here.
Patients Patient demographics are presented in Table 1. Changes
in gas exchange are presented in Table 2. Complications
attributable to HFOV were CVS instability (4/25); pneumothorax
(3/25) and ETT blockage (2/25). Two out of 25 patients died on
HFOV; 5/25 died on CV post-HFOV and 18/25 were discharged
alive from the ICU.
Conclusion HFOV is currently perceived as a rescue therapy in
adult patients unresponsive to CV. Our experience of using HFOV
in acute lung injury shows that it is an effective method of
ventilation in refractory respiratory failure and is also a safe and
practical alternative to CV when used early in acute lung injury.

Superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) is a special
form of combined high-frequency jet ventilation described in other
studies as an effective respiratory therapy of acute lung injury (ALI)
patients. We compared this technique with conventional
mechanical ventilation in oleic-acid-induced ALI piglets over a
study period of 5 hours. After ALI induction, 18 pigs were randomly
assigned to three groups. A SHFJV group with a high-frequency
(500 bpm) and a low-frequency (15–20 bpm) jet stream and a
PEEP of 10 cmH2O; a CPPV group (continuous positive pressure
ventilation) presenting VT = 10 ml/kg, I:E = 1:1, PEEP = 10 cmH2O;
and a IPPV group (control group; intermittent positive pressure
ventilation) VT = 10 ml/kg, I:E = 1:1, zero PEEP. SHFJV animals
showed an earlier and more efficient improvement in oxygenation
compared with group B (90 vs 180 min; PaO2 70.5 ± 11.3 vs
41.2 ± 7.9 kPa) despite lower mean airway pressures applied
(16 ± 1.4 vs 22 ± 1.8 mbar). CO2 elimination was also more
effective (6.0 ± 1.4 vs 8.2 ± 1.6) although peak airway pressures
were the lowest (30 ± 3.8 vs 45 ± 4.6 mmHg). SHFJV may
therefore be useful in ALI management.

Introduction High-frequency ventilation (HFV) is a concept of
mechanical ventilation that is mainly used in therapy of infants. The
resistance of the small neonatal endotracheal tubes (ETT) causes a
noticeable difference between airway pressure (proximal end of the
ETT) and tracheal pressure (distal end of the ETT). The aim of this
laboratory study was to evaluate the pressure drop across the ETT

during HFV and to investigate whether tracheal pressure can be
calculated from airway pressure using conventional methods.
Methods A physical model of an infant’s respiratory system was
connected with one of two differently sized ETTs (ID 3 mm or
4 mm; Blue Line, Portex Ltd., Hythe, Kent, UK) with the positioning
of the tip inside the trachea of the model. The ETT was bent along
a test fixture to approximate the in-situ curvature of an ETT
simulating the nasal route of intubation. An infant HF-ventilator
Sensormedics 3100A (SensorMedics Corp., Yorba Linda, CA,
USA) was used to ventilate the model with an I/E ratio of 1:2. We
varied mean airway pressure from 8 to 16 mbar (in steps of
2 mbar), the set airway pressure amplitude from 10 to 50 mbar (in
steps of 10 mbar) and the frequency to 5 Hz, 10 Hz and 15 Hz,
respectively. We analyzed the pressure drop across neonatal ETTs
in a physical model setup during different conditions of HFV.
Results We found that depending on the ventilator’s settings the
relative loss of mean pressure amplitude caused by the ETT
ranged from 23.8% up to 51.2% during the positive flow phase
and from 3.3% up to 24.7% during the negative flow phase.
Additional to the well-described flow dependency of ETT
resistance we found an increase of resistance caused by the HFV.
Due to this effect, calculation of the ETT’s pressure drop using the
Rohrer or Blasius-Itos approach underestimated the true pressure
drop significantly.
Conclusion We conclude that an increased pressure drop during
HFV caused by the ETT must be considered to be dependent on
the size of the ETT, the ventilation frequency and the flow rate, the
latter implicating a dependency on the ventilator’s performance in
flow delivery. For the patient’s respiratory system only that part of
delivered energy that is transferred to the patient’s lung is of
relevance. This means that decisions for setting parameters of HFV
must be made from the view of tracheal pressure. For an adequate
noninvasive monitoring of tracheal pressure during HFV, new
methods for calculation of the pressure drop across the ETT
appear crucial.

acute respiratory failure

Oncology, University of Sheffield, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P25 (doi:10.1186/cc4372)
Introduction Acute respiratory failure and ARDS remains an
important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients admitted to
the ICU. Several trials were conducted to improve the survival in
patients with respiratory failure. The efficacy and safety of the use
of surfactant in improving the outcomes of patients with ARDS was
recently evaluated in several trials.
Objective This review is primarily aimed at assessing the efficacy
of surfactant in improving the survival of adult patients with acute
severe respiratory failure.
Search strategy The following databases were searched for
reports of trials: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 4), MEDLINE
(1966–November 2005), and EMBASE (1980–November 2005).
In addition, bibliographies of review articles and potentially
included studies were also searched.
Selection criteria Prospective randomized controlled trials
comparing surfactant treatment with the standard care (or placebo
and standard care) in managing adult patients with acute
respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation
were included.
Data collection and analysis Data regarding clinical outcomes
including the survival at 28 days, the duration of mechanical
ventilation, the duration of ICU and hospital stay, and adverse
effects. The data on the methodological quality (allocation
concealment, intention to treat analysis and Jadad score) of the
trials were collected a using a standardized data extraction form.
Wherever the data were adequate, the outcomes of interest were
quantitatively pooled using a random effects model.
Main results Out of the 16 potentially eligible studies, five trials
randomising a total of 1315 patients were included in the analysis.
Three of these trials were pilot trials conducted to assess the
safety (and efficacy) of surfactant. The other two were large trials
conducted to evaluate the efficacy of surfactant. The pooled data
on mortality suggested no significant effect of surfactant in
reducing the mortality (odds ratio = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.81–1.26:
P = 0.9). The data on other outcomes such as the duration of
ventilation, ICU and hospital stay, and adverse events were not
suitable for performing a meta analysis. The two large trials have
both shown an increased incidence of adverse effects in patients
where surfactant was used.
Conclusion The use of surfactant is not associated with an
improvement in survival in adult patients with severe respiratory failure.

experience in a medical ICU

Introduction Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a
technology that provides gas exchange and supports cardiac
function in patients with ARDS or cardiac failure. We report on the
experience with ECMO in our medical ICU, a tertiary centre.
Patients ECMO was started in 20 patients (14 males/six females)
failing conservative treatment with life-threatening respiratory (13
patients), cardiac (two patients) or combined failure (five patients).
Bypass surgery was performed bedside. For respiratory failure, veno-
venous (v/v) access was used; for cardiac failure, veno-arterial (v/a)
access was preferred. The mean age was 45.3 years. Nine apparently
immunocompetent patients presented with community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP). Two of these later appeared immunocompromised
and had opportunistic infections. Eight other immunocompromised
patients received ECMO. The remaining three patients had ARDS
due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock and nosocomial pneumonia.
Results The average APACHE II score was 24.5 and SOFA score
was 11.5. The Murray score before the start of ECMO averaged
3.2. The mean duration of ventilation was 32.5 hours and the
average PaO2/FIO2 was 53.8 mmHg. In 13 patients the bypass
was initially v/v, in seven patients v/a. In one patient v/v access was
changed to v/a as cardiac failure developed. In another patient the
v/a bypass was switched to v/v for insufficient oxygenation of the
upper body. The mean duration of ECMO was 6.4 days (range
0.5–18), and mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 13.1
days (range 0.5–36). Overall survival was 50%. All patients that
survived weaning from ECMO were also discharged and are still
alive with a mean follow up of 804 days. Seven out of nine patients
with CAP survived. Only 3/10 immunocompromised patients
survived. All three are still alive after 2, 23 and 34 months. Ten out
of 20 patients died. Twelve technical complications occurred, two
of which were fatal (massive bleeding).
Discussion and conclusion ECMO is a potentially life-saving
technology. Our overall survival was 50%. Unfavourable factors
such as low pH and low pO2/FIO2 do not exclude a successful

S13
ECMO intervention as our two patients with the lowest pH (6.89
and 6.95) survived, as did four out of seven patients with
PaO2 / FIO2 < 40 mmHg. Predictive factors therefore cannot be
used as exclusion criteria. Patients who develop intractable acute
respiratory insufficiency due to CAP without underlying disease
seem to benefit most from ECMO. Most series of ECMO reported
in the literature exclude immunocompromised patients. We confirm
that these patients stand a poor prognosis (survival of 30%).
However, long-term and good functional survival appears to be
possible in selected patients. v/a bypass seems to carry a higher
risk for major and potentially fatal technical complications. v/a
bypass is only indicated if cardiac support is required. Increasing
experience from the ECMO team probably reduces the incidence
of technical complications.

Introduction In spite of the advances in pre-neonatal and neonatal
intensive care including the use of antenatal steroids, foetal
surgery, nitric oxide (NO), surfactant, high-frequency oscillation
(HFOV), liquid ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(ECMO), the mortality of patients with congenital diagrammatic
hernia (CDH) remains high. The use of ECMO is generally
reserved for patients who cannot be managed by other treatments
such as HFOV, NO and surfactant. The aim of this study was to
identify factors that could predict the outcome in patients with
CDH requiring ECMO.
Methods This study is a retrospective review of case records,
microfilms and our database between September 1991 and
December 2004. All patients with CDH managed in our unit using
ECMO were included. ‘Pre ECMO’ variables such as gestational age,
sex of the patient, birth weight, age at the time of ECMO cannulation,
acid–base status and blood gasses and ventilator settings before
commencing ECMO, and variables during the ECMO course such as
the mode of ECMO (VA vs VV), use of NO, surfactant, liquid
ventilation, vaso-active agents, timing of repair of CDH, use of blood
products, and complications (mechanical and patient related) on
ECMO were analysed to identify predictors of outcome.
Results A total of 52 patients were managed using ECMO in our
unit during the study period. All these patients were referred to our
unit following the failure of maximal conventional treatment. The
mean gestational age at birth was 38.9 (SD 2.74) weeks and the
birth weight was 2.92 (SD 0.44) kg. The APGARS scores were
4.35 (SD 2.9) at 1 min and 5.93 (SD 2.9) at 5 min of birth. The
mean age at the time of referral for ECMO was 2 (SD 3.1) days.
The mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 49.7 (SD 49.8). The overall survival
to hospital discharge was 58%. The mode of ECMO was
venovenous in 27 patients and venoarterial in 25 patients. On
univariate analysis, the mean duration of ECMO (181 ± 120 vs
317 ± 156 hours; P = 0.001), use of NO (6 vs 10; P = 0.049) and
renal complications (4 vs 14; P < 0.001) were significantly
different between the survivors and nonsurvivors. The pre ECMO
variables were comparable between the survivors and non-
survivors. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the variables
included in the analysis revealed the duration of ECMO and renal
complications developing on ECMO to be independently
associated with mortality.
Conclusion Prolonged duration of ECMO and renal complications
on ECMO were independently associated with mortality. None of
the pre ECMO variables could be identified as predictors of
mortality in patients with CDH requiring ECMO.

Introduction Nowadays it is not clear whether the level of
hypoxemia is related to the outcome. It has been shown that the
pulmonary dead space fraction is an independent risk factor for
death in the early phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome [1].
Objective We aimed to study possible respiratory predictors for
mortality in mechanically ventilated patients.
Materials and methods Consecutive patients invasively
mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours were enrolled. At
ICU admission blood gas exchange and the ventilatory setting
were recorded.
Results Sixty-eight patients (45 males, mean age 59.6 ± 15.5 years,
weight 71.6 ± 14.1 kg) were enrolled at one ICU from October
2004 to October 2005. Thirty-seven patients presented acute lung
injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome during their intensive
care stay.
The overall intensive care mortality was 23% (16 patients). The blood
gas analysis showed a mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 207 ± 120 mmHg,
PaCO2 of 37 ± 10 mmHg and pH of 7.34 ± 0.13 with the following
ventilatory setting: PEEP 8.1 ± 4.6 cmH2O, respiratory rate
17.8 ± 5.2 bpm, tidal volume 662 ± 145 ml and minute ventilation
9.1 ± 2.0 l/min. Among the respiratory variables considered only the
PaCO2 was associated with an increased intensive care mortality
(OR 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.021–1.152).
Conclusion The increase in PaCO2, reflecting a higher degree of
pulmonary impairment, was associated with intensive care
mortality.

Introduction In clinical conditions when the mechanical properties
of each lung of a patient differ very much, it is necessary to
ventilate them separately. The connection of each lung with one
respirator, by means of a double-lumen endotracheal tube, enables
its physical separation and control of its ventilation. Generally,
therefore, two synchronized respirators are required to perform

differential ventilation of lungs. It is also possible to use one respirator
with a feedback-controlled variable pneumatic valve to divide the total
ventilation volume from a respirator between two lungs.
Materials and methods A prototype of a flow divider based on
stabilization of tidal volume measurement, according to adjust-
ments made by an anesthesiologist, was designed. This feedback-
controlled circuit can precisely keep the tidal volume division on a
constant value, irrespective of lung mechanics (alveolar/chest
compliance, airway resistance) and ventilatory parameter (frequency,
total tidal volume and selective PEEP) changes. In order to assess
the solution that was realized, one respirator with a feedback
control of tidal volume division was tested using a physical model
of the adult respiratory system and in clinical conditions, during
thoracic surgery.
Results The physical model of respiratory system consisted of two
parallel circuits of artificial lung. The model study has proved that
maximal errors of tidal volume division are less than 10% in a wide
range of division ratio and PEEP value, which is acceptable in
clinical practice. Differential ventilation was applied to 10 patients
undergoing thoracic surgery. Measurement of each lung parameter
showed the stable tidal volume division (error < 10%) in all patients.
Conclusion Clinical data show that the proposed system fulfils the
same function as two synchronized ventilators, with independent
adjustment of volume and PEEP to each lung.

Open lung ventilation does not increase right ventricular
afterload in cardiac surgery patients

Open lung ventilation (OLV) consists of recruitment maneuvers,
followed by low tidal volume and elevated positive end-expiratory
pressure (PEEP). Elevated PEEP is associated with an increased
right ventricular (RV) afterload. We investigated the effect of OLV
on RV afterload during inspiration and expiration in patients after
cardiac surgery using Doppler echocardiography.
In 28 patients scheduled for cardiac surgery, two ventilation
strategies were applied in a randomized cross-over design. During
OLV, recruitment maneuvers were applied until PaO2/FiO2 > 375 Torr
was achieved (reflecting an open lung) and were maintained by the
use of sufficient levels of PEEP. The tidal volume was 4–6 ml/kg.
During conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) the ventilation
was with a low tidal volume (6–8 ml/kg) with 5 cmH2O PEEP,
without recruitment maneuvers. The acceleration time (Acmean) of
the pulmonary artery was measured with transesophageal
echocardiography in a long-axis view of the pulmonary artery
during end-inspiration and end-expiration.
The total PEEP in the OLV group was 14 ± 4 compared with 5 ±
1 cmH2O in the CMV group. During expiration, the Acmean of both
ventilation strategies was comparable. Inspiration caused a
significant decrease of Acmean compared with expiration during
CMV (Table 1). Surprisingly, this did not occur during OLV.
We conclude that despite the use of ‘relatively’ high PEEP, OLV
with low tidal volume does not increase RV afterload during
inspiration and expiration.

Introduction The present study examines the possibility of non-
interventional detection of expiratory flow limitation (EFL) during
experimental mechanical ventilation (MV), with the aid of nonlinear
regression analysis.
Methods Eight New-Zealand rabbits under MV were included in
the study. EFL was induced by the application of negative
expiratory pressure (–5 to –10 hPa) and recognised by the
negative expiratory pressure technique. The airway pressure (Paw)
and flow (V′) were recorded and treated offline with the aid of the
nonlinear model Pao = EEP + E1.V + E2.V2 + k1.V′ + k2.V′.|V′| +
k3.V.V′, which accounts for volume dependence of elastance and
flow and volume dependence of resistance. The timed signal of
resistive pressure (Pres) was reconstructed after subtraction of
elastic nonlinear pressure from the whole pressure.
Results and conclusions The Pres signal presents two different
configurations that permit one to separate between EFL and non-
EFL. More specifically, in cases without EFL Pres is similar to the
flow signal, while in cases with EFL expiratory Pres presents a
minimum, which corresponds to the point of EFL installation. We
conclude that the present technique, which combines
computational and graphical parts, offers the possibility of EFL
recognition and quantification at least during mechanical ventilation.

Introduction Vibration response imaging (VRI) is a novel
technology that utilizes sophisticated software and surface skin
sensors placed on the back to record, analyze and display
vibrations as a non-invasive measure of lung ventilation.
Hypothesis Compared with assist volume control ventilation
(AVC), pressure support ventilation (PSV) will result in a greater
spatial distribution of lung airflow.
Methods We performed serial VRI during maintenance AVC and
immediately following initiation of a spontaneous breathing trial
using low-level PSV in 26 mechanically ventilated patients.
Recordings were performed over 12–20 s periods of respiration.
Respiratory cycles free of noise or motion artifacts were chosen for
analysis, and images at mid-inspiration were analyzed. Areas of
images were calculated digitally using the program ImageJ. The
areas of right and left lung measured at mid-inspiration were

summed, and compared, AVC vs PSV. Statistical analysis was
performed using a t test and the t distribution.
Results The tidal volume (VT) was 534.8 ± 69.4 ml for AVC and
decreased to 407.6 ± 152.1 ml for PSV (P = 0.00015). The mean
areas of both lungs were 68.75 ± 11.06 and 71.57 ± 10.50 (mean
in kilopixels ± SD) in the AVC and PSV images, respectively
(P = 0.00985). There was a mean increase of 4.73 ± 9.09% in the
areas of the lungs during PSV compared with AVC (P = 0.039).
Conclusions Despite a lower VT, PSV (compared with ACV)
produced a greater spatial distribution of lung airflow. Possible
mechanisms of this PSV-associated increase are the increase in
patient-generated negative intrapleural pressure during inspiration
and better synchronization of patient-negative pressure with
positive pressure from the ventilator. VRI allows a non-invasive
quantitation of airflow distribution during different modes of
mechanical ventilation.

Objective In patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) the use of spontaneous
breathing modes in mechanical ventilation can be beneficial.
Nevertheless the opportunity to combine different forms of
assisted ventilation is not sufficiently investigated. We evaluated
the effects of the combination of different modes of spontaneous
ventilation on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in patients
with ALI or ARDS.
Design A prospective, interventional study.
Setting ICU of a university hospital.
Patients Seven patients who were ventilated mechanically for at
least 24 hours due to acute respiratory insufficiency.
Methods Each patient was ventilated using one of four ventilation
modes for a time period of 45 min, followed by a 15-min
equilibration period. All four respiratory settings were applied in
randomly assigned order in every patient. A: biphasic positive
airway pressure (BIPAP); B: BIPAP in combination with pressure
support (BIPAP + PSV); C: BIPAP in combination with automatic
tube compensation (BIPAP + ATC); D: pressure support
ventilation in combination with ATC (PSV + ATC). In every
ventilator setting all patients had spontaneous breathing efforts in
at least 30% based upon minute ventilation (VE). The settings
were adjusted to achieve a tidal volume (VT) of 6–8 ml/kg body
weight. Hemodynamic data were obtained every 15 min and at the
end of each period blood gas analyses were obtained. The primary
endpoints were the patient’s work of breathing obtained by the
Bicore CP-100 pulmonary monitor (Bicore, Irvine, CA, USA).
Results The mean tidal volume was 6.51 ± 0.36 ml/kg body
weight. In combination with automatic tube compensation,
inspiratory pressure support obtained the highest work of
breathing in all tested modes (A: 0.80 ± 0.15 J/l vs B: 0.86 ±
0.17 J/l vs C: 0.96 ± 0.19 J/l vs D: 1.47 ± 0.22 J/l). Hemodynamic
parameters and indices of pulmonary gas exchange did not differ
between the tested modes.
Conclusions Our results show that PSV in combination with ATC
obtained the highest work of breathing. A possible reason is that
PSV assists every single breath and acts more like controlled
ventilation than an assisting mode. The combination of different
modes of spontaneous breathing has no benefit on the work of
breathing the patient had to obtain when BIPAP is used as the
primary ventilator mode.

Introduction Vibration response imaging (VRI) measures the
vibration response energy generated from airflow to create a
radiation-free, dynamic, real-time, structural and functional image of
the respiration process. The characteristics of VRI in mechanically
ventilated patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) has not been previously studied.
Hypotheses This was an observational study to compare the VRI
of mechanically ventilated (MV) patients with no known pulmonary
disease with those with COPD.
Methods Five consecutive MV patients with COPD were
compared with five consecutive MV patients with no known
pulmonary disease. Using custom-designed software the vibration
signals were fitted to a mathematical function and a gray level
frame was constructed. At peak inspiration and expiration, spatial
areas of the images were captured and the total area of the image
calculated using Image J Software.

Results In patients with normal lungs, the spatial distribution of the
maximal signal expiratory vibration response image was lower than
the maximal signal during inspiration. The mean decrease in area
was 8103 pixels + 20,606 (P = 0.01) (Table 1). In patients with
COPD the spatial distribution of the maximal signal expiratory
vibration response image during expiration was higher than the
maximal signal inspiratory image. The mean increase in area was
19,214 pixels + 6552 (P = 0.03) (Table 2).
Discussion The increase in the image area during the expiratory
phase in COPD patients may reflect increased airflow resistance
causing increased vibration energy. Air trapping and auto-PEEP
are other possible mechanisms accounting for the expiratory
increase in image area.
Conclusion VRI provides real-time non-invasive lung imaging of
airflow in the mechanically ventilated patient. Mechanically
ventilated COPD patients demonstrate a dramatically different VRI
pattern than normal MV patients. VRI may provide important
diagnostic information in COPD patients.

pattern and work of breathing during pressure support
ventilation: a laboratory and simulation study

Introduction The influence of the resistance of endotracheal tubes
(ETT) on the additional work of breathing (WOB) has been
extensively evaluated. However, not only the ETT resistance
causes additional WOB, but also the connecting tubes and
swivels (CT+S) that are placed between the Y-piece and ETT. This
study was performed to test the hypothesis that CT+S significantly
increase the resistance of the breathing circuit with the
consequence of increased WOB during PSV.
Methods Four different types of CT+S (Rüsch, Medisil, Medisize,
Mallinckrodt) were ventilated using a sinusoidal flow pattern, and
the flow-dependent pressure drop across the CT+S was recorded.
Flow dependency of the pressure drop was determined by fitting
Rohrer’s equation (∆P = K1*V′ + K2*V′2). The resulting
coefficients K1 and K2 were used in a mathematical simulation of
PSV ventilation to calculate the influence of CT+S on breathing
pattern, minute ventilation (VE) and WOB in simulated normal,
obstructive and restrictive patients.
Results The resistance of the different models of CT+S widely
varied. The CT+S type used in our ICU had a resistance of 3.1
mbar/l/s (at 1 l/s), comparable with a #9 ETT. Dependent on the
patient’s disease and muscle strength (Pmus) and on the
ventilatory demand, the use of CT+S reduced minute ventilation by
up to 13% (Fig. 1). If the additional WOB is accomplished by the
patient, he/she has to increase the Pmus by up to 45% (Fig. 2). If
the pressure support is increased instead, an additional pressure
of up to 37% has to be applied (Fig. 3). In some simulated patients
with pulmonary obstructive disease, this additional pressure
support caused missed efforts and additional dynamic
hyperinflation. Interestingly, in simulated pulmonary restriction, a
paradox effect of the additional resistance on tidal volume during
PSV was observed: the reduction of peak inspiratory flow led to a
delayed cycling of inspiration. As the cycling criterion during PSV
(flow drop to 25% of peak inspiratory flow) results in a very short
inspiratory time in these patients, a delayed cycling led to an
increased inspiratory time and hence to an increased tidal volume.
Conclusions The resistance of CT+S adds significant load to the
respiratory system. CT+S consisting of low resistive parts should
therefore be preferred. In restrictive patients, PSV without variable
cycling may be an inappropriate mode.

Background Patients undergoing emergency or elective spinal
surgery often require mechanical ventilation for prolonged periods
because of their inability to protect their airways, persistence of
excessive secretions, and inadequacy of spontaneous ventilation.
Tracheostomy plays an integral role in the airway management of
such patients; however, its timing still remains subject to
considerable practice variation
Study design A retrospective review of all spinal surgery
admissions to the ICU and high dependency unit (HDU) from the
National Spinal Injuries Unit (NSIU) at the Mater Misericordiae
University Hospital over a 4-year period (n = 152).
Objective To assess the intensive care requirements of a tertiary
referral centre specializing in acute spinal cord injury and diseases
of the spine, and to identify risk factors associated with respiratory
compromise in the spinal surgery patient.
Methods A retrospective review of all spinal surgery admissions
from the NSIU to the ICU and HDU at the Mater Misericordiae
University Hospital between 1 January 2002 and 30 September

2005 (n = 152). The Hospital Inpatient Enquiry System, NSIU and
ICU databases were used to identify our study cohort. The medical
records, ICU records and the computerized hospital inpatient
system were utilized to gather all relevant data. Parameters
evaluated included demographics, vertebral level, APACHE II
score, forced vital capacity, tracheostomy placement, pneumonia,
premorbid pulmonary disease, smoking history, evidence of direct
thoracic/lung trauma, operative intervention, associated appendicular
trauma, and pre-existing medical comorbidities.
Results There were 152 spinal admissions to the ICU between
1 January 2002 and 30 September 2005. The average length of
stay was 6.6 days (range 1–35 days). Ninety-eight patients were
subsequently admitted to the HDU for further intensive
management. The average stay for the HDU admissions was 6.5
days (range 1–58 days). Tracheostomies were performed in 36 of
these 152 patients (24%). The percentage of high cervical spinal
cord injuries was 35% (54/153). We found a significant correlation
between high cervical spinal cord injury and respiratory
compromise warranting tracheostomy placement, with a relative
risk ratio of >1.0.
Conclusion Several risk factors were identified corresponding to
frequent tracheostomy placement in patients undergoing major
spinal surgery. Early tracheostomy may be considered in patients
with multiple risk factors to reduce the duration of stay in the ICU
and facilitate the weaning of ventilatory support.

Effect of inspiration rise time on work of breathing and
patient comfort during pressure support ventilation

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P38 (doi:10.1186/cc4385)
Introduction Pressure support ventilation is widely used in patients
in the ICU. Matching the patient’s respiratory needs with adequate
ventilator settings is necessary to ensure a low work of breathing
(WOB) and maximal patient comfort. The inspiratory rise time (IRT)
determines the time to reach the selected airway pressure. A short
IRT results in a high peak inspiratory flow and a short time to reach
that peak, but is also associated with the development of turbulent
flow, resulting in increased WOB. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effects of different IRT settings on WOB and patient
comfort during pressure support ventilation.
Methods We performed a prospective, single-blind cohort study in
patients on pressure support ventilation. Ten healthy adult patients
admitted to the ICU after elective facial or neck surgery were
included. All patients were ventilated in the pressure support mode
using a Servo 300 ventilator (Siemens, Elema, Solna, Sweden),
with a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, a
pressure support level of 12 cmH2O above PEEP and an
inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.40. Patients were awake and
cooperative (Ramsay 2). WOB was measured with an esophageal
balloon and a miniature flowmeter (Bicore system). Breathing
comfort was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging
from 1 to 10. WOB and patient comfort was measured (in random
order) at 0, 5, and 10% IRT. For statistical analysis, two-way
analysis of variance was used. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results An interim analysis was performed after four of a total of
10 patients. The WOB increased from 0.25 ± 0.11 J/l at 0% IRT to
0.48 ± 0.01 J/l at 5% IRT and 0.59 ± 0.21 J/l at 10% IRT (values
expressed as mean ± SD). At the same time the patients comfort
as analysed by the VAS decreased from 5.5 (4.0–7.75) at 0% IRT
to 4.5 (3.0–6.5) at 5% IRT and 2.0 (1.0–3.75) at 10% IRT (values
expressed as median [IQR]). Analysis of all patient data with a
complete statistical analysis will be available soon.
Conclusions With increasing IRT the WOB increases and patient
comfort decreases. In this category of patients we therefore
suggest using the shortest IRT (0%).

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P39 (doi:10.1186/cc4386)
Introduction During pressure support ventilation (PSV) the
ventilator cycles from inspiration to expiration when the inspiratory
flow reaches a given percentage of the peak inspiratory flow
‘expiratory trigger’ (ET). On the most recent available ventilators it
is possible to modify the percentage of the ET.
Objective We evaluated in a group of COPD patients during PSV
the change of ET (high 40% and low 5% of the peak inspiratory
flow, respectively) in terms of the pattern of breathing and
inspiratory effort (pressure time product [PTP]).
Materials and methods Nine COPD patients were studied during
respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 295 ± 108, PEEP 6.2 ± 1.7 cmH2O,
mean age 70 ± 2 years, and BMI 25.4 ± 4.3). PSV was set at
5 cmH2O without PEEP while the oxygen fraction remained
constant during the study. Airway, esophageal, gastric pressures
and airflow were measured.
Results See Table 1.

Objective During mechanical ventilatory support the use of
spontaneous breathing modes can be beneficial. Nevertheless the
opportunity to combine different forms of assisted ventilation is not
sufficiently investigated. We evaluated the effects of the
combination of different modes of spontaneous ventilation on
global end-diastolic volume and cardiac output in patients after
elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
Design A prospective, interventional study.
Setting ICU of a university hospital.
Patients Eight postoperative patients who underwent elective
coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

S18
Methods After admission to the ICU each patient was ventilated
using one of three ventilation modes for a time period of 30 min,
followed by a 15-min equilibration period. All three respiratory
settings were applied in randomly assigned order in every patient.
A: biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP); B: BIPAP in
combination with pressure support ventilation (BIPAP + PSV);
C: pressure support ventilation (PSV). In every ventilator setting, all
patients had spontaneous breathing efforts in at least 30% based
upon minute ventilation (VE). The settings were adjusted to achieve
a tidal volume (VT) of 6–8 ml/kg body weight. At the end of each
30-min period bolus thermodilution-derived cardiac output was
obtained from thermodilution curves detected in the femoral artery.
Three intermittent consecutive boli consisting of 10 ml ice-cold
saline were randomly injected over the ventilatory cycle. The
primary endpoints were the global end-diastolic volume and the
cardiac output obtained by the PICCO monitor (Pulsion Medical
AG, Munich, Germany).
Results The mean tidal volume (VT) was 7.81 ± 0.31 ml/kg body
weight. The mean airway pressure was A: 8.80 ± 1.36 mbar vs
B: 8.72 ± 0.90 mbar vs C: 8.33 ± 1.73 mbar (P = not significant).
No differences were found for GEDV (P = 0.99), stroke volume
(P = 0.23) and cardiac output (P = 0.35). Respiratory parameters
and indices of pulmonary gas exchange did not differ between the
tested modes.
Conclusions The combination of different modes of spontaneous
breathing has no different effects on hemodynamic parameters of
patients after elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery when
the mean airway pressure did not change.

Streamlining the weaning process within a UK critical care
network
D Field
NHS, Surrey, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P41 (doi:10.1186/cc4388)
Current UK practice demonstrates that weaning from mechanical
ventilation (MV) is an ad-hoc process, where weaning is not valued
and there is a paucity of research related to weaning compared
with North America and other European countries. Evidence exists
outside the United Kingdom that proactive approaches to weaning
yield benefits to service and coordination form a dedicated,
experienced practitioner within a systematic framework generates
positive outcomes.
The Surrey Wide Critical Care Network (SWCCN) comprises four
district general hospitals with a total of 30 level-3 critical care beds.
A weaning audit was undertaken by the SWCCN Nurse
Consultant across all four ICUs over a 3-month period in 2003.
The audit demonstrated that the process of weaning was often
inconsistent and at times haphazard, especially in relation to those
patients who have difficulty in weaning from MV. This often led to
an unnecessary increase in ICU length of stay (LOS). The audit
also established that patients weaning from MV can be identified
into three groups: (1) those patients who will wean from MV within
24–72 hours; (2) those patients who will wean from MV within
3–21 days; and (3) those patients who will have a prolonged stay
in ICU and a complex weaning process greater than 21 days.
In order to streamline and coordinate the whole weaning process
and effectively manage the three groups of weaning patients
across the SWCCN, a systematic evidence-based framework with
three distinct pathways was developed and implemented within in
all four ICUs by the Network Nurse Consultant (Fig. 1).
Following 1 year of implementation the framework was audited and
demonstrated the following:
• The process of weaning all three patient groups within all four
ICUs was much more systematic and consistent.
• A reduction in ITU LOS in patient groups 1 and 2.
• Quicker identification and placement onto the rehabilitation
pathway of those patients who would require a prolonged ITU
stay and have complex weaning problems. Their management
and care was much more coordinated.
• Symbiosis of ventilation care bundle and weaning framework.
• Identification for the need of a specialist regional weaning
unit.

support and T-tube induces ventricular arrhythmia in
cardiac patients

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P42 (doi:10.1186/cc4389)
Introduction Weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV) can be
associated with cardiac arrhythmias. Few studies are found
comparing their occurrence during weaning with pressure support
ventilation (PSV) and T-tube (TT) in patients with and without heart
disease.
Objective To evaluate the occurrence of arrhythmias in these
groups of patients during PSV and TT.
Methods Patients without (group 1) and with (group 2) heart
disease, under mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours, were
observed during 30 min of PSV or TT, in a random order. Variables
analyzed were: age, APACHE score, length of stay in the ICU
(LOS), and cardiorespiratory variables including respiratory rate,
rapid shallow breathing index (f/VT), maximum inspiratory (PImax)
and expiratory (PEmax) pressure. A continuous ECG was recorded
by the Holter method. For statistical analyses, repeated-measures
ANOVA or ANOVA on ranks was used.
Results Twenty-two patients were studied, 13 in group 1 and nine
in group 2. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 showed: no
differences in APACHE score (23 ± 4; 23 ± 8, not significant),
PImax (32 ± 19; 28 ± 12 cmH2O, not significant) and PEmax
(24 ± 10; 20 ± 7 cmH2O, not significant); f/VT was greater in
cardiac patients during TT (PSV: 48 ± 25 versus 41 ± 18;
TT: 42 ± 18 versus 57 ± 20, ANOVA, P < 0.05), as well as the

respiratory rate (PSV: 21 ± 6 versus 20 ± 5; TT: 22 ± 6 versus
25 ± 6, ANOVA, P < 0.05). The occurrence of ventricular
arrhythmias (median and interquartile ranges), respectively, in PSV
and TT in group 1 were 1 (0–13) vs 1 (0–5.5) and in group 2 were
3 (0.5–87) vs 21 (4–61) (ANOVA, P < 0.05).
Conclusions During weaning from MV, cardiac patients showed a
higher respiratory rate and higher f/VT during TT when compared
with PSV, as well as a greater occurrence of ventricular
arrhythmias in both methods when compared with noncardiac
patients.

Introduction Non-invasive mechanical ventilation with positive
pressure (NPPV) has been investigated in several acute respiratory
failure situations. There are some doubts considering its benefits
during weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).
Objective To evaluate the use of NPPV in patients with difficult wean-
ing characterized by failure in a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).
Methods All patients under IMV for more than 48 hours from June
2003 to February 2005 were submitted to a SBT. Those that failed
during the first 30 min of a T-piece trial, and without contra-
indications to NPPV, were randomized back to IMV (conventional
treatment) or changed to NPPV. Contraindications to NPPV
included patients with facial trauma or cranial surgery, recent
gastric or esophagic surgery, tracheostomy, respiratory secretion
excess, agitation and noncooperative behaviour that were excluded
from the experiment. Inclusion in the experiment was authorized by
signed informed consent. Previous to subjecting the patient to SBT
we collected a sample of arterial blood gases and we measured
the maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax). During spontaneous
ventilation in the T piece, in the 1st and 30th min measurements of
tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation (Ve), respiratory rate (f), rapid
shallow breathing index (f/VT), heart rate and peripheral oxygen
saturation were taken. After randomization to IMV or NPPV,
patients were followed clinically and evaluated concerning the time
of ventilation, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU and in the ward,
complications and the mortality rate.
Results Out of 156 patients, 65 (42%) failed in the T-piece trial, of
which 28 were submitted to NPPV and 37 were maintained under
IMV. The average ages of the NPPV and IMV groups were
67.6 ± 15.5 and 59.7 ± 17.6 years, respectively. Chronic pulmonary
disease aggravation, heart diseases and postoperative respiratory
failure were the most frequent causes of IMV use. Ventilation time
previous to SBT was 7.3 ± 4.1 days for both groups. Cardiac and
respiratory parameters were similar for both groups, either at 1 or
30 min of SBT as well as during their follow-up. The percentage of
complications in the NPPV group was lower than in IMV (28.6% vs
75.7%), with lower incidence of pneumonia and tracheostomy.
Death occurred in 29% in the NPPV and 22% in the IMV group
(not significant). LOS in the ICU was similar for both groups
(10.3 ± 9.4 for NPPV vs 11.8 ± 9.1 days for IMV) and LOS in the
ward was lower for the NPPV group (9.6 ± 12.7 vs 15.0 ± 18.6
days, not significant).
Conclusions NPPV can be used as a good ventilation procedure
for patients with difficulties during weaning from mechanical
ventilation. It is related to a lower incidence of ventilation-
associated pneumonia and a lower need for tracheostomy.

Introduction Physiologic changes occurring during transition from
mechanical ventilation (MV) to spontaneous ventilation can
overload the cardiorespiratory system and cause difficulties in the
weaning process. There are few reports studying myocardial
function during weaning from MV.
Objective To evaluate cardiorespiratory parameters and cardiac
function during weaning from MV.
Methods Patients under MV for more than 48 hours and prone to
weaning were observed during 30 min of pressure support ventilation
(PSV) and T-tube, in a random order, and with a rest period of at least
30 min between methods. Variables analyzed were: age, APACHE
score, underlying disease, period of MV, length of stay (LOS) in ICU
and hospital, basal ventilatory parameters, cardiorespiratory
parameters in the first and 30th min, ECG, echocardiogram and
blood gas analysis in the 30th minute in both methods.
Echocardiographic parameters, obtained at the end of expiration with
the patient in a position offering the best window, included:
measurements of heart cavities; ejection fraction; acceleration of the
E wave of mitral inflow (MI); deceleration of the E wave of MI; duration
of the A wave of MI; isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT); mitral E/A ratio
and myocardial performance index (MPI). Values obtained during PSV
and T-tube were compared using a t test.
Results Sixteen patients (mean age 53 ± 20 years and APACHE
score 17 ± 6) have been analyzed up to now. The majority of
patients had neurologic diseases. The period of MV was 25 ± 25
days and the LOS in the ICU was 35 ± 35 days. Twelve patients
were extubated and four failed during the T-tube trial. Comparisons
between PSV and T-tube showed similar results concerning
cardiorespiratory parameters as well as echocardiographic
measurements. The difference between patients that failed and
those successfully extubated was a lower level of PaO2 as well as
a higher value of rapid shallow ventilation index during T-tube.
Conclusions In our preliminary results in this group of patients
under weaning from mechanical ventilation, echocardiographic
assessment of cardiac function showed no differences when
comparing PSV with T-tube.

Background The extubation time after cardiac surgery and its
impact on outcome have been extensively studied recently. Many
studies reported that early extubation (within 8 hours) appears to
be safe without an increased incidence of morbidity. Some
intraoperative and preoperative factors may have an important
influence in predicting early extubation and determining strategies
to optimize postoperative therapy.

Objective To investigate predictors of early extubation.
Design A prospective cohort study.
Setting A 19-bed medico-surgical ICU in a private hospital.
Patients All 104 patients admitted after cardiac surgery.
Measurements and results One hundred and four cardiac
surgical patients were admitted to our ICU from March to
November 2005; 63 (60.6%) were male; 85 (81.7%) were
submitted to coronary artery bypass grafts, 17 (16.3%) to valvular
replacement and 23 (2%) to combined surgery. The mean
extubation time was 8.9 ± 21.96 hours. Patients were divided into
two groups: early extubation (EE — within 4 hours) (n = 56
[53.8%]) and late extubation (LE — after 4 hours) (n = 48 [46.2%]).
Mean extubation times for EE and LE were 2.52 ± 1.49 hours and
16.52 ± 30.7 hours (P < 0.001), respectively. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis showed that the use of peridural anesthesia
was the best independent predictor of early extubation (OR =
9.37, 95% CI 2.19–40.17). The presence of acute coronary
syndrome and the Ontario score were also independent predictors
of early extubation (OR 7.17 with 95% CI 1.99–25.77 and OR
0.648 with 95% CI 0.5–0.84, respectively). The Ontario score had
an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.731 (95% CI
0.635–0.826), with the best cutoff value of ≤5 points.
Conclusions In this cohort, use of peridural anesthesia was the best
predictor of early extubation after cardiac surgery. The presence of
acute coronary syndrome and a low Ontario score also were
independent predictors of successful early extubation. This conclusion
raises the hypothesis that patients with an elevated Ontario score
could benefit from peridural anesthesia to be extubated earlier.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P46 (doi:10.1186/cc4393)
Background Weaning may represent 40% of the time spent by
patients on mechanical ventilation (MV). A stable cardiovascular
system and minimum dose of vasopressor medication is required
to withdraw from MV in current guidelines. We found no evidence
to support this practice, and this can lead to an unnecessary
prolonged time of MV.
Objective To evaluate whether the use of norepinephrine (NE)
interferes with weaning success (WS) in septic patients.
Design A prospective observational clinical study.
Methods All patients were on MV for more then 48 hours. Patients
able to be weaned according to the institutional protocol were
submitted to a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) during 30 min
and followed for 48 hours after extubation. All patients had blood
gas analyses, hemodynamic (heart rate [HR], mean arterial
pressure [MAP]) and ventilatory parameters (respiratory rate, tidal
volume, f/Vt, maximal inspiratory pressure [MIP]) recorded. The
outcome was a return to MV within 48 hours after extubation. Data
are expressed as mean ± SD and were compared by two-way
t test and chi-squared; P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results Sixty-three septic shock patients were included from
January to September 2004. Mean age was 59.6 ± 17.6 years and
APACHE II score was 20.3 ± 6.5. The reintubation rate was 19%
and mortality was 15.9% overall. Clinical, hemodynamic and
ventilatory variables were not related to weaning outcome.
During acute illness, the maximal NE dose was 0.52 ± 0.29 and
0.12 ± 0.10 µg/kg/min at SBT. Neither the maximal NE dose
during septic shock nor the NE dose during SBT were different
between weaning failure (WF) and weaning success (WS)
patients (Table 1).
Conclusion NE use was not a contraindication to weaning and
extubation from MV in patients recovering from septic shock.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P47 (doi:10.1186/cc4394)
Objective To determine outcome predictors of non-invasive positive
pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in patients with hypoxaemic acute
respiratory failure (HARF).
Design Retrospective analysis.
Method One hundred patients with HARF treated with NIPPV in a
30-bed tertiary care hospital were analysed. A successful outcome
of NIPPV was avoiding endotracheal intubation, and failure was
considered if intubation was needed. We classified the patients into
three etiological subgroups: (1) acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema
(ACPE), (2) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary
to sepsis, and (3) miscellaneous group including pulmonary
embolism, bronchial asthma exacerbation, postoperative respiratory
failure, status post-extubation, etc. We compared various patient
variables and parameters among successful and failure groups.
Results The overall success rate of NIPPV was 56% in avoiding
intubation. The success rate in the ACPE, sepsis-related ARDS
and miscellaneous subgroups were 71.79%, 29.26% and 80%,
respectively. Logistic regression analysis exhibited duration of
NIPPV (OR 4.137, P = 0.02), number of organ failures besides the
respiratory system (negative coefficient –1.4193) and post-NIPPV
PO2/FiO2 ratio (P = 0.0342) as significant predictors of outcome
of NIPPV. In subgroup analysis of ACPE, left ventricular ejection
fraction >30% was a predictor of successful outcome. In subgroup
analysis of sepsis-related ARDS, a lower PO2/FiO2 ratio and a
higher number of organ failures were associated with unfavourable
outcome (P = 0.02 and P = 0.0184).
Conclusion In HARF, ACPE as a cause of ARF, shorter duration of
NIPPV, higher post-NIPPV PO2/FiO2 ratio and fewer organ failures

were associated with a favourable outcome of NIPPV. In subgroup
analysis of ACPE, left ventricular ejection fraction >30% was a
predictor of successful outcome of NIPPV. In subgroup analysis of
sepsis-related ARDS, a lower PO2/FiO2 ratio and higher number of
organ failures were associated with poorer outcome.

Introduction Mechanical ventilation results in an increased risk of
pulmonary complications in the newborns treated for respiratory
failure in NICUs.
Aim This abstract reports on our 2-year experience with the
application programme of the infant flow (IF) method in infants (in
67 neonatal centres in Poland between 1 August 2003 and
30 April 2005).
Methods We reviewed collected data of 1321 newborns
(male/female 799/522; range of gestational age 22–45 weeks;
birth weight 480–4950 g).The indications for treatment were
categorized into three classes: RDS, weaning and other.
Results The IF method enabled us to avoid intubation in these
groups in 77.8%, 61.2% and 77.9%, respectively. The lowest rate
of complications compared with the two other groups was in the
RDS group (Table 1). Low gestational age was associated with a
statistically significantly lower rate of successes than higher
gestational age: 62.7 and 83%. A similar effect was seen while
comparing success rates of newborns by weight: 60.7 and 82.4%.
The incidence of pneumothorax was 1.1%. Among extrapulmonary
complications PDA occurred in 12.8%; ROP 11.9%; IVH 7.4%;
PVL 3.6% of infants. Occurrence of local complications was
infrequent, as shown in Table 2.
Conclusions The results strongly suggest that the IF method is
effective and clinically valuable. Some typical problems consistent
with the ‘learning curve’ phenomenon were observed during the
study.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P49 (doi:10.1186/cc4396)
Background In the ICU non-invasive ventilation (NIV) allows one to
reduce the complications related to endotracheal intubation and
mechanical ventilation (e.g. increased infections), and it could
improve the outcome of patients in certain clinical conditions.
Actually only few trials support the use of NIV in trauma patients
and its use is limited in this clinical setting.
Methods We performed a retrospective evaluation of 29 patients
with major trauma admitted to our ICU over a 2-year period from
January 2004 to December 2005 (ISS 25.97 ± 10.29, SAPS II
25.31 ± 9.38). All patients had thoracic trauma, and four patients
had associated head trauma. Twenty-four patients have been
treated with CPAP delivered by helmet, two patients were
ventilated with PSV by face mask, two with PSV by TotalFace
Mask®, and one with both PSV by TotalFace Mask® and CPAP by
helmet. The indications for NIV have been: in 21 cases traumatic
pulmonary contusion, in four cases atelectasis, in three cases
pneumonia and in one case reduction in chest wall compliance. In
18 patients NIV has been employed for weaning from invasive
mechanical ventilation, and in the other 11 patients NIV was the
first mode of ventilatory assistance. We evaluated the ability of NIV
to improve oxygenation (P/F ratio).
Results Patients have been treated with NIV for 4.41 ± 2.33 days.
Twenty-five patients (86.2%) significantly improved oxygenation
after NIV (Table 1) (t test; P < 0.001) and were discharged from
the ICU. Four patients failed the NIV and were intubated (in two
patients NIV had been used for weaning): in this subgroup of
patients two died of septic shock from pneumonia. In the subgroup
of intubated patients the duration of mechanical ventilation was
7.17 ± 5.02 days and the length of stay in the ICU was 14 ± 5
days. Mortality in the NIV group was 13.8%.
Table 1 (abstract P49)
ISS 25.97 ± 10.29
SAPS II 25. 31 ± 9.38
P/F before NIV 200.6 ± 50.9
P/F after NIV 284.4 ± 88.5
Conclusions NIV has proved to ensure adequate oxygenation and
to be successful in respiratory assistance of patients with thoracic
trauma. It could be considered a valid alternative to endotracheal
intubation in trauma patients requiring ventilatory support. Further
investigations are needed to evaluate the incidence on outcome
and to define indications.

Aim To assess in vitro the usefulness of three paediatric uncuffed
endotracheal tubes of various shapes: a standard (one-diameter)
tube, a Cole tube and the newly designed cone tube, use of which
is not associated with an increased risk of periglottic trauma.
Methods The flow (0–30 lpm) resistance (RETT) was measured
across the length of each tube and repeated for similar tubes of
internal diameters 3, 3.5 and 4 mm. The imposed work of breathing
(WOBI), necessary to overcome the tube resistance, the patient’s
resistive work of breathing (RWOB) and the pressure–time
product (PTP) were determined from the computer simulation of a
spontaneous breathing, intubated infant.
Results The resistance of the 3.5 mm ID cone tube to 10 lpm air
flow was 44% and 6% lower when compared with the resistance
offered by the standard and the Cole tubes, respectively. The
WOBI necessary to overcome the cone tube resistance was
approximately 44% and 6% lower than with using the standard and
the Cole tubes, respectively. The RWOB and PTP of the virtual
infant intubated with the cone and with the Cole tubes were
similar; however, the values of both parameters decreased by 18%
and 8%, respectively, in comparison with the situation when a
standard tube was used.
Conclusion Replacement of a standard endotracheal tube with the
cone or Cole tubes resulted in a significant decrease of RETT,
WOBI, RWOB and PTP.

Influence of rhDNAse on the duration of mechanical ventilation
in intensive care patients: interim analysis of the LUFIT trial

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P51 (doi:10.1186/cc4398)
Background rhDNAse is effective in the treatment of children with
cystic fibrosis [1]. A significant reduction of the duration of
ventilation by rhDNAse has been reported in children following
cardiac surgery [2].
Objective To investigate whether rhDNAse is able to reduce the
duration of ventilation in adult mechanically ventilated intensive
care patients.
Methods After approval of the local ethics committees we
conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised,
multicentre national trial. Patients were stratified into two subgroups
depending on their status as surgical or nonsurgical. The trial was
started within 48 hours after the start of mechanical ventilation and
lasted until weaning was successful. Patients in the active treatment
group received 2.5 ml rhDNAse endotracheally twice a day.
Patients in the placebo group received the same amount of normal
saline. This interim analysis reviewed 98 nonsurgical patients. Data
from 85 patients were included in the analysis.
Results Forty-four patients in the study group and 41 patients in the
placebo group were analysed. Factors such as gender, weight,
smoking habit, chronic pre-existing diseases and prevalence of
COPD were distributed equally in both groups. Three patients died
in the rhDNAse group versus eight in the placebo group. The median
duration of ventilation was 140 hours (CI 120–200 hours) in the
rhDNAse and 324 hours (CI 178–442 hours) in the placebo group.
Discussion This interim analysis suggests that rhDNAse may have
the potential to reduce the duration of ventilation in adult
nonsurgical intensive care patients. This confirms results obtained
in paediatric patients [2]. Data from surgical patients will be
presented as soon as the interim analysis in that group is
completed.

The efficacy of intratracheal rhDNase therapy in the
treatment of severe hypercapnoeic respiratory acidosis in
ventilated children with status asthmaticus and bronchiolitis

Objective Successful rescue therapy with intratracheal recombinant
(rh) DNAse has been documented in case reports of severe status
asthmaticus with life-threatening mucus plugging [1]. Benefit may
occur via its mucolytic properties or enhancement of mucociliary
transport. The aim of this study was to report the efficacy of rhDNAse
in terms of CO2 clearance in a cohort of ventilated children with
severe airflow obstruction secondary to either status asthmaticus or
viral bronchiolitis unresponsive to conventional therapy.
Method We reviewed retrospectively the case notes of 19
ventilated patients admitted to a tertiary paediatric ICU with a
clinical diagnosis of asthma or bronchiolitis who received
rhDNAse therapy for severe persisting hypercarbic acidosis
(pCO2 > 10 kPa, pH < 7.2) despite optimising conventional
ventilation (peak inspiratory pressure > 28 cmH2O, pressure
control mode). One millilitre per kilogram of rhDNAse (0.25 mg/ml
concentration in 0.9% saline) was instilled bronchoscopically
(n = 4) or blindly (n = 15) into the trachea followed by percussive
physiotherapy with adequate patient sedation and muscle
relaxation. Ventilator settings (Servo 300) and arterial blood gases
were recorded pre-DNAse and at 4 and 8 hours after therapy
according to our standard DNAse protocol. Tidal volumes were not
measured due to known inaccuracy of the Servo 300 ventilators.
Data were analyzed using two-way, repeated-measures ANOVA.
Significance levels for group (asthma vs bronchiolitis), time (0, 4
and 8 hours) and interaction effects are reported.
Results Patient demographics are presented in Table 1. There was
a significant fall in arterial pCO2 in both groups over the 8 hours after
DNAse therapy (time effect P = 0.01, group effect P = 0.03; Fig. 1),
which was mirrored by a rise in pH (time effect P = 0.002). This was
associated with a reduction in peak inspiratory pressure (time effect
P = 0.03; Fig. 2) which was more pronounced in asthma (interaction
effect P = 0.004; Fig. 2). Patients with bronchiolitis were ventilated
at a higher rate than asthma (group effect P = 0.001), which did not
change with time (time effect P = 0.4), suggesting the reduced
pCO2 was a function of improved tidal volumes.
Conclusion Intratracheal DNAse with percussive physiotherapy
may offer an effective method to improve ventilation in status
asthmaticus and bronchiolitis patients with severe hypercarbic
acidosis. Further studies are warranted.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P53 (doi:10.1186/cc4400)
Introduction Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is a
widely used and accepted method of long-term ventilation of
critically ill patients in many ICUs.
Aim To study the use of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) during
PDT for controlled ventilation in critically sick patients and compare
its complications and duration procedure in relation to the ETT.
Methods and materials A prospective, randomized clinical trial
performed in the seven-bed general ICU of a training and research
hospital of the Ministry of Health. The bedside PDT was performed
in 73 critically ill patients in a period of 3 years. Patients were
randomly assigned to ventilation via LMA (n = 31 patients) and to
ventilation via ETT (n = 42). The duration of the procedure and
complications were compared in the two groups.
Results The ETT group and the LMA group did not differ regarding
age. There was no significant difference in the operating time
between the two groups. We found that the incidence of
complication was 26.2% in the ETT group and 25.8% in the LMA
group (Table 1).
Table 1 (abstract P53)
Complication ETT (n [%]) LMA (n [%]) P = 0.971
(+) 11 (26.2) 8 (25.8)
(–) 31 (73.8) 23 (74.2)
Conclusion The LMA is an effective and successful ventilatory
device during percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. For PDT,
the LMA has an advantage over the ETT of lying remote from the
operating field. The LMA does not cause the difficulties associated
with the use of an ET such as cuff puncture, tube transection by
the needle, and accidental extubation.

Background In ARF patients treated with non-invasive ventilation
(NIV) a low pH value not improving within 2 hours greatly increases
the risk of NIV failure. In relation to the high diaphragm lactate
production, we tested the hypothesis that the lactate clearance
(LC) was more predictive of the risk of NIV failure in comparison
with the difference in pH (DpH) in patients with cardiac pulmonary
edema (PE) and metabolic or mixed acidosis.
Methods Forty-seven consecutive patients observed in the
Emergency Room with PE were treated with pharmacological
therapy (FiO2 0.5, morphine, inotropes, diuretics, vasodilators if
hypertensive) and CPAP (10 cmH2O) by helmet if they had
metabolic acidosis, or BIPAP (IPAP 14 cmH2O – EPAP 6 cmH2O)
by face mask if they had mixed acidosis. The mean inspiratory
airway pressure was the same in the two ventilatory treatments.
Blood gas analysis were performed at admission and every 30 min
for 2 hours. Clearance of lactate was calculated as: lactate start –
lactate (30 min, 1 hour, 1.5 hour, 2 hour) / lactate start × 100 (%).
Results Significant results were obtained after 2 hours of NIV. In
Table 1 the pH value at admission and after 2 hours of NIV and
lactate clearance at 2 hours are reported in 35 patients responding
to NIV and 12 patients who failed NIV. The higher proportions
predicted to fail were with DpH < 0.01 and LC < 25% at 2 hours
(OR 3.4 and 5.1, respectively). In another 15 similar patients we
compared the predicted risk of failure of NIV related to DpH < 0.01
and LC < 25%, selecting an arbitrary probability of failure equal to
50% between expected and observed failures: the C statistics

Conclusions Lactate clearance is a reliable indicator of the
response of patients with PE to NIV. LC < 25% is more sensible
than DpH < 0.01, perhaps because it does not take into account
confounder factors related to previous metabolic acidosis. It could
be considered a cost-effective method for early triaging of patients
to be admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation.

Introduction Early tracheostomy has been associated with
improved outcome in patients with high likelihood of death or
ventilator dependency. While a significant number of patients with
acute lung injury (ALI) require prolonged mechanical ventilation
and could potentially benefit from early tracheostomy, lack of an
accurate prediction limits its utilization in this group of patients.
Methods From the database of the second international study of
mechanical ventilation we selected patients with ALI who were
alive and invasively ventilated on the third day post intubation. From
a broad range of risk factors prospectively collected during the first
3 days of mechanical ventilation, univariate and multivariate logistic
regression identified variables associated with increased risk of
death or ventilator dependency.
Results From 372 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 281 reached
a composite outcome of either death or ventilator dependency of
more than 2 weeks. One hundred and ninety-nine (53%) died in
the ICU, 104 (28%) were ventilated >14 days and 76 (20%)
underwent tracheostomy, median 12 (IQR 8–18) days after the
intubation. A score based on age and day 3 values of oxygenation
index, VE 40 (minute ventilation needed to bring PaCO2 to
40 mmHg) and shock predicted death or ventilator dependency
better (area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]
0.71) than SAPS II (AUC 0.51) or day 3 SOFA (AUC 0.54) scores.
Conclusion If confirmed in an independent sample, this score may
be a useful tool to identify patients with ALI who might benefit from
early tracheostomy

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P56 (doi:10.1186/cc4403)
Introduction Respiratory inductive plethysmography (RIP) is a
widely used method providing important information on the
breathing pattern. This non-invasive technique is particularly
interesting in infants and newborns. However, the different
calibration methods developed in adults to allow the measurement
of volume have not been validated in premature infants, even if they
are frequently used. We developed a calibration method using the
least square method to identify the coefficients (α; β) to calculate
the reconstructed volume from the RIP signals (V = α ribcage + β
abdomen) with a pneumotachograph (PNT) signal as reference,
and using an individually adapted filter to suppress heart artefacts.
Objectives To compare the accuracy of this calibration method
with three frequently used calibration methods: a simple fixed-
coefficients method with either equal weight attributed to the
abdomen and rib cage (method 1:1) or with a higher weight
attributed to the abdomen (i.e. β = 2α; method 1:2); and an
equivalent of the qualitative diagnostic calibration method, using
coefficients proportional to the standard deviation of abdomen and
ribcage signals (β / α = SD(abdomen) / SD(ribcage)) (method SD).
Methods Twelve premature infants breathing spontaneously were
studied. Birth weight was (mean ± SD) 1528 ± 340 g; gestational
age 31.2 ± 0.6 weeks; age 6 ± 2 days. A specially adapted RIP
jacket was installed 15 min before the study. RIP signals were
recorded continuously. A face mask connected to a PNT was
applied during two 30-s periods. The most regular 15 PNT cycles
were identified and served as reference period, during which the
coefficients (α; β) were calculated with each method. The four
reconstructed flows were then recalculated, and we estimated the
distance R2 between reconstructed flows and the PNT reference
signal for the entire period of PNT; with R2 = 1 – (mean square
difference between the normalized flows / variance of PNT); that is, a
R2 value closer to 1 represents a better reconstruction of the signal.
Results The mean distance R2 was 0.62 ± 0.22 with method 1:1,
0.63 ± 0.22 with method 1:2, 0.62 ± 0.23 with method SD, and
0.70 ± 0.17 with the least square method (P = 0.02; repeated-
measure ANOVA with a significant difference between the last
method and the three others). The ratios β/α were 2.1 ± 1.5 and
2.9 ± 4.3 with the two last methods, respectively.
Conclusions This new RIP calibration method using the least
square method with a short period of PNT as reference and an
individually calculated filter gives a better reconstructed flow as
compared with three other calibration methods. This method
attributes a higher weight to the abdominal signal.

Setting A 450-bed tertiary cancer referral center with a nine-bed
ICU and 10 HDU beds.
Patients and methods One hundred and ninety patients
underwent percutaneous tracheostomy between November 1996
and September 2001, using the Griggs technique. Of these, 23
patients were deemed to be coagulopathic (platelet count
< 70,000 or PT > 18, PTT > 60). We determined the incidence of
bleeding and other complications in these patients.
Results Only one patient had major bleeding, requiring surgical
intervention and conversion to surgical tracheostomy. This patient
also had a difficult tracheostomy complicated by pneumothrorax.
Twenty patients required perioperative transfusion of platelet
concentrates or fresh frozen plasma. Five patients received single
donor platelets (average 1 ± 0), eight patients received random
donor platelets (average 3.6 ± 1.30), and 15 patients received
fresh frozen plasma (average 3.8 ± 2.7). Minimal blood loss was
observed in the 22 other patients. Of the 167 patients without
coagulopathy, four patients had significant bleeding. There was no
difference in the incidence of hemorrhagic complications between
coagulopathic and noncoagulopathic patients (P > 0.05, chi-
square test).
Conclusion Percutaneous tracheostomy is a safe procedure in
coagulopathic patients with adequate coagulation factor
replacement.

(OSA) may help in the selection of patients who require ventilatory
support. This study investigates the value of sleep studies in
predicting the requirement for postoperative continuous positive
airway pressure ventilation (CPAP) and high-dependency unit
(HDU) admission.
Methods During the development of our service since 2001, 34
consecutive patients, mean age 42 years (29–61), mean weight
146 kg (100–210), mean BMI 54 (39–75), all underwent
preoperative assessment by a respiratory physician before
laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, based on which 28 had
sleep studies while six did not. The decision to provide CPAP was
determined by sleep study results: patients with moderate or
severe OSA were electively prescribed CPAP preoperatively and
postoperatively.
Results Sleep studies were normal in 19 patients (NSS) and
abnormal in nine patients (ABSS). In ABSS, OSA was severe in
four patients, moderate in one patient, and mild in four patients.
Preoperative and postoperative CPAP was prescribed electively
for the five patients with moderate and severe OSA.
Postoperatively, 3/19 of the NSS patients required CPAP and
were admitted to the HDU. Another NSS patient was admitted to
the HDU because of her age (61 years). The duration of operation,
stay in recovery, and timing of extubation were comparable for
NSS and ASS. The mean BMI was 63 and 53 in ASS and NSS
patients, respectively (P = 0.05).
Conclusion Postoperative CPAP and HDU admission was
required in 21% of NSS patients. Although ABSS was associated
with higher BMI, sleep studies do not reliably predict postoperative
CPAP or HDU requirements.

Objectives Acute pulmonary embolism increases pulmonary
resistance and may lead to acute right ventricular failure and cardio
circulatory collapse, possibly resulting in substantial morbidity and
mortality. Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) dilates pulmonary blood vessels
and has been used to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance in
patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and
acute respiratory distress syndrome. This case series describes
our experience with inhaled NO administered to four patients
suffering from acute massive pulmonary embolism following
abdominal surgery.
Results The four described patients were recovering from small
bowel resection, pancreatoduodenectomy, hemipelvectomy or recent
gastrointestinal bleeding and presented with severe respiratory and
hemodynamic deterioration due to pulmonary embolism. Each
received inhaled NO (20–25 ppm) via the inspiratory side of the
breathing circuit of the ventilator. Pulmonary and systemic blood
pressures, heart rate and gas exchange levels improved in all the
patients within minutes after the initiation of NO administration.
Conclusions Inhaled NO may be useful in treating acute massive
pulmonary embolism. This potential application warrants further
investigation.

evidence-based?

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P60 (doi:10.1186/cc4407)
Introduction The management of severe respiratory failure (SRF)
remains a challenging problem. With the availability of many
options with variable results, the management of patients with SRF
is likely to vary between different ICUs and these practices may not
necessarily be evidence-based. In this study we aimed to define
the respiratory and the general management of the patients with
SRF, and to identify the treatment practices that are evidence-
based in the surveyed ICUs in the UK.
Methods This study is a questionnaire survey of the ICUs that were
participating or were willing to participate in CESAR (www.cesar-
trial.org), an ongoing randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing
ECMO with conventional intensive care for SRF. Although
participating ICUs are free to use any modality of treatment at their
discretion, the CESAR trial recommends a low tidal volume
ventilation strategy according to the ARDS Network group. The
collaborators of all 87 participating ICUs (out of a total of 262 ICUs
in the United Kingdom) were requested to complete a postal
questionnaire between February 2002 and May 2004. The
response rate was 100%. A literature search for RCTs and meta-
analyses of RCTs was performed to identify practices studied in this
survey that were proved to improve survival in patients with SRF.
Results The practices in the surveyed ICUs are shown below, with
the percentages of the ICUs in parentheses. Practices that were

proven to improve survival by at least one RCT are highlighted with
an asterisk.
• Preferred mode of ventilation: pressure controlled (82%),
PRVC (6%), volume controlled (7%), HFOV (5%).
• PEEP strategy: above lower inflection point (28%), best PEEP
against SPO2 (61%), other (e.g. empirical high PEEP 10–15,
Best PEEP against SPO2 and tidal volumes) (11%).
• Peak plateau pressure limitation: <30* (48%), >30 (37%).
• Practice of ARDS network group approach* (ventilation with
low tidal volumes) (69%).
• Use of nitric oxide (10%); prone ventilation (91%).
• Timing of tracheotomy: within 48 hours (16)*, within 7 days
(51%); percutaneous* (95%), surgical (3%).
• Routine cardiac output monitoring (63%): PA catheter (38%),
oesophageal monitor (44%), other (18%); resuscitation fluid:
colloids (82%).
• Target Hb: 7–9 gm*% (69%), 9–10 (14%) >10 gm% (17%).
Conclusion Although there are variations of practices in the
management of adult patients with SRF, most of the ICUs
evaluated in this survey are following evidence-based practices.
This should improve the survival of patients managed
conventionally in the CESAR trial compared with historical results.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P61 (doi:10.1186/cc4408)
Background In a continuous peritoneal oxygen flow model, we
studied its influence on hemodynamic stability, arterial and mixed
venous gases, comparing its effects in normal and in oleic-acid-
induced ARDS lungs.
Methods Four pigs were anesthetized, mechanically ventilated and
invasively monitored with a Swan–Ganz and femoral catheter. A
continuous infusion of dobutamine (2 µg/kg/hour) was maintained.
Arterial pressure, cardiac output, pulmonary compliance, PCWP, and
arterial and mixed venous gases were measured every hour. Baseline
measures were taken and three laparoscopic trochars were introduced
in the abdomen. A continuous oxygen flow of 5–6 l/min was
maintained for 8 hours with a sustained intra-abdominal pressure of
5–6 mmHg using a continuous low-pressure flow system (PEROX). At
the fifth hour an oleic acid (OA) dose (0.2 mg/kg) was injected into the
pulmonary circulation. Afterwards, lungs were histopathologically
studied to evaluate the presence of ARDS. A two-way ANOVA with
replication was used for the sequential analysis of data.
Results PEROX demonstrated efficiency to maintain normal
oxygenation indexes even though the presence of ARDS after the
injection of OA was confirmed with a histopathological study and a
significant difference in the pulmonary compliance (P = 0.032).

This is evident because no statistical difference was observed in
oxygen indexes and variables during the 4 hours posterior to the
injection of OA (Fig. 1).
Conclusions This experimental model demonstrated that
peritoneal oxygenation could be an effective gas interchange-
supporting alternative in ARDS. The mechanism of action could be
an increase of the mixed venous oxygenation.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P62 (doi:10.1186/cc4409)
Introduction Critically ill asthmatics that require mechanical
ventilation may benefit from halothane and other inhalational
agents. Various methods of administration of halothane have been
tried. Anaesthetic machines are commonly used but are resource-
expensive.
Methods We used a simple in-line Oxford Miniature Vaporiser
(OMV), as part of the inspiratory limb of a Servo 300 (Siemens)
mechanical ventilator. We employed this device in three patients
for a total duration of 120 hours without adverse effects.
Results The OMV is a small and portable thermally buffered
vaporiser used to speed the induction of anaesthesia (Fig. 1).
‘Draw over anaesthesia’ is simple in concept and entails drawing a
carrier gas over a volatile liquid, thus entraining its vapour to the
gaseous carrier. ‘Draw over’ systems operate at less than, or at,
ambient pressure, and flow through the system is intermittent,
varying with different phases of inspiration, and ceasing in
expiration. A one-way valve prevents reverse flow in the circuit. This
is different to ‘plenum anaesthesia’ in which a carrier gas is pushed
through the vaporiser at a constant rate. In ‘draw over’ systems the
carrier gas is drawn through the vaporiser either by the patient’s
own respiratory efforts or by a self-inflating bag or manual bellows
with a one-way valve placed downstream from the vaporiser.
Conclusion We used the OMV as part of a regular positive
pressure ventilatory circuit. The OMV was specially calibrated for
halothane and was robust and reliable. Halothane delivery was
controlled and in steady fashion; a simple wall-suction unit
scavenged the exhaled halothane. Staff acceptance and user-
friendliness were high. We recommend the OMV for regular ICU
use for halothane in asthma.

Assessment of oxygen consumption from standard E
cylinders by fluidic, turbine, and compressor style portable
mechanical ventilators

University of Cincinnati, OH, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P63 (doi:10.1186/cc4410)
Background Gas consumption of portable ventilators is an
important variable when considering ventilation in mass casualty
events. We evaluated the oxygen consumption from standard E
cylinders of fluidic (IC-2A; BioMed Devices, CT, USA), turbine (LTV-
1000; Pulmonetic Systems, MN, USA), and compressor (Impact
754; Impact Instrumentation, NJ, USA) style transport ventilators.
Methods Each ventilator was connected to a Training Test Lung
(TTL) (Michigan Instruments, MI, USA) in Assist Control (A/C) with
tidal volume (VT) 750 ml at a rate of 12 breaths per minute (bpm),
providing a minute ventilation (VE) of 9.0 l/min. The positive end
expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set at 0 and 10 cmH2O, and the
fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 1.0 and 0.5. Ventilators used
either compressed gas (IC-2A) or electricity (LTV-1000 and Impact
754) as power sources. All oxygen sources were standard E
cylinders beginning with 2200 psi (680 l) connected to ventilators
with standard regulators. Ventilators were connected to TTL by
manufacturer-provided corrugated tubing. FiO2 and VE were
continuously monitored during each run and the time of operation
was recorded. Three runs were conducted at each ventilator
setting. The time of operation was recorded and the ventilator
oxygen consumption was calculated.
Results Each run delivered 9 l VE on A/C ventilation to the TTL.
With FiO2 1.0 and PEEP 0 cmH2O, times to complete E cylinder
gas consumption for the IC-2A, LTV-1000, and Impact 754
ventilators, respectively, were 34.3 (±1.2), 43.3 (±0.6), and 69.0
(±1.7) min. With FiO2 1.0 and PEEP 10 cmH2O, run times were
34.0 (±1.0), 41.8 (±1.6), and 69.3 (±1.2) min. For the LTV-1000
and the Impact 754 with FiO2 0.5 and PEEP 0 cmH2O, respective
run times were 105.8 (±13.0), and 144 (±11.6) min. For each run
the oxygen consumption in addition to the delivered VE for the
IC-2A, LTV-1000, and Impact 754 was 10.8 (±0.7), 6.7 (±0.2),
and 0.9 (±0.2) l/min with FiO2 1.0 and PEEP 0 cmH2O, and was
11.0 (±0.6), 7.3 (±0.6), and 0.8 (±0.2) l/min with FiO2 1.0 and
PEEP 10 cmH2O. For the LTV-1000 and Impact 754, oxygen
consumption was 3.2 (±0.8) and 1.4 (±0.4) l/min on settings of
FiO2 0.5 and PEEP 0 cmH2O.
Conclusions Our initial runs to assess E cylinder oxygen
consumption of various types of ventilators demonstrate that fluidic
and turbine style ventilators consume more oxygen than
compressor style ventilators. The turbine ventilator tested uses a
continuous flow of 10 l/min, which is gas inefficient. PEEP has little
effect on oxygen consumption. Use of the internal air source and
lower FiO2 significantly increased the length of operation from an E
cylinder. If oxygen E cylinders are a scarce resource, our data
suggest that compressor style transport ventilators may currently
be the transport ventilators of choice.

Prehospital endotracheal intubations in vitally comprised
children in The Netherlands

Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen,
The Netherlands
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P64 (doi:10.1186/cc4411)
Introduction The reason for the study was to evaluate prehospital
endotracheal intubations of vitally compromised children. The data
studied were collected by a Dutch Helicopter-transported Medical
Team (HMT) that provides advanced medical care in the eastern
part of The Netherlands. The HMT consists of a specially trained
physician and paramedic transported to the incident location by
helicopter in day-time. The Dutch HMT is activated together with
the emergency medical service (EMS) by the dispatch centre, or by
the EMS paramedics from the incident location. Activation of the
HMT is according to a structured list of incident situations and/or
the medical condition of the patient.
Design Retrospective analysis of 297 HMT calls for prehospital
vitally comprised children (<16 years) from 2001 to 2005 by the
HMT-Netherlands-East. Registered data included age, sex,
physiological parameters, prehospital treatment given, and survival
until hospital discharge.
Endotracheal intubation was performed by either the EMS
paramedic or the HMT physician. Intubation was confirmed by the
HMT physician with auscultation and capnography. For descriptive
analysis, the Fischer exact test and relative risk were used on
SPSS. P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
Results The EMS on scene cancelled the paediatric HMT calls
before the landing of the helicopter in 36% (n = 107) — reasons:
no serious injury 82% (n = 88), deceased 10% (n = 11), other 8%
(n = 8). The HMT examined and treated 190 children on scene.
The EMS paramedic attempted an endotracheal intubation in 33
patients before the arrival of the HMT, and the HMT physician
performed 89 endotracheal intubations. The success rate of
endotracheal intubation for EMS paramedics was 70% (n = 23)
and for the HMT physician 100% (n = 89) (P < 0.001).
The HMT physician checked the endotracheal intubation and
ventilation on arrival by auscultation and capnography; an
emergency correction had to be performed by the HMT physician
in 10 out of 33 patients. Four patients had an oesophageal
intubation, four patients had an inappropriate sized endotracheal
tube making ventilation impossible, and two patients had lethal
ventilator settings. Two of these 10 patients were discharged from
the hospital in good condition, the others died at the incident
scene or in the hospital.
Thirty-three per cent (n = 65) of all patients had an initial
prehospital Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3 or 4. The overall
survival rate until hospital discharge with an initial GCS of 3 or 4
was 23% (n = 14). The survival rate until hospital discharge with a
GCS of 3 or 4 was 6.5% (n = 2) for the EMS-intubated group, and
40% (n = 12) for the HMT-intubated group (Fischer exact P =
0.007).
Conclusion Successful endotracheal intubation is a difficult task
for EMS paramedics; 30% of all recorded endotracheal intubations
resulted in potentially lethal complications. Mask-balloon ventilation
is to be preferred to a failed intubation effort; prehospital
endotracheal intubation of children calls for an experienced
physician.

Air ambulances and customized military aircraft are established
modes of transporting critically ill patients. Defence services and
aid agencies even have flying hospitals, replete with operating
theatres and ICUs. With burgeoning travel by an increasingly
elderly population, a growing number of travelling Australians suffer
critical illnesses overseas. Transcontinental air ambulances are
prohibitively expensive and many American and European
commercial airlines ban travel by seriously ill patients.
Transit intensive care on board commercial airline flights poses
complex physiological and logistic challenges. We have
transported hundreds of critically ill patients and report on 10
episodes of aero-intensive care with IPPV on board scheduled
passenger services. These were from the Philippines, the USA, the
United Kingdom, Thailand, France, Norway and Austria on Qantas,
Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways and Malaysia Airlines.
The aviation environment imposes a bewildering array of electronic,
safety and security related issues to be overcome. The entire
mobile ICU weighs 100 kg. A vacuum-mattress on a stretcher
fitted to the cabin floor at the rear of the economy-class cabin and
screened off from the other passengers ensures patient privacy
(Fig. 1). Oxygen is scarce and extremely expensive during flight.
We employed the ‘circle system’ with a CO2 absorber and in-line
oxygen analyser. Mobile suction, infusion pumps, transit-care
monitors and portable blood gas analysers were all adapted for
use in commercial aircraft.
Australia and New Zealand lead the world in transit care of the
critically ill in commercial airliners.

Introduction The aim of this clinical trial was to study the
incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in ICU patients after
surgical (SGT) and percutaneous (PCT) tracheostomy.
Methods We studied retrospectively 108 patients, 79 men and 29
women, who underwent tracheostomy. Mean age: 52.4 ± 21.4
years, mean stay in ICU: 27.9 ± 11.6 days. All patients were
mechanically ventilated. Underlying diseases: multiple trauma 69
patients, complicated surgery 23 patients, other 16 patients.
Timing of procedure was determined by the ICU doctors, while the
method of tracheostomy was determined by both the ICU and the
Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) doctors. The patients were divided into
two groups: group A (60 patients) who had a PCT and group B
(48 patients) who had a SGT. The mean time of hospitalisation
from admission to tracheostomy was 10.2 ± 3.1 days. PCT were
performed by ICU doctors at the bedside, while SGT were
performed by ENT doctors (32 at bedside and 16 in the surgery
room–theater).
Results In group A NP was diagnosed in 23 patients (38.3%),
mean time to tracheostomy from infection: 4.1 ± 2.1 days. In group
B NP was diagnosed in 18 patients (37.5%), 3.5 ± 2.4 days after
tracheostomy. The types of invading microorganisms were similar
in both groups. The mortality rate in group A was 20/60 = 33.3%
and in group B was 18/48 = 37.5%. We noticed one tracheal
infection in group A (1.7%) and three in group B (6.2%); this
difference was not statistically significant.
Conclusion There is no significant difference in incidence of NP
between patients receiving PCT and SGT. The type of infection
and pathogens are similar. Tracheal infections are very rare in both
groups.

Too few, too late: submission patterns of bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid samples obtained under the suspicion of the
diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia
C Linssen, W van Mook, M Drent, E Cornelissen, J Jacobs
University Hospital Maastricht, The Netherlands
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P67 (doi:10.1186/cc4414)
Introduction At our hospital, ventilator-associated pneumonia
(VAP) is diagnosed by microbiological and cytological analysis of
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Opening hours of the inhouse
microbiological laboratory are between 8.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m.
During off-hours a laboratory technician is on call for urgent
samples including BAL fluid. The total laboratory workup of the
BAL fluid including the differential cell count takes 2 hours. The
present study aimed to analyse the day and hour submission
patterns of BAL fluid samples.
Materials and methods During a 58-month period (January
2000–October 2005), the day and hour of submission of all
consecutive BAL fluid samples obtained from patients suspected
of VAP were recorded. The diagnosis of VAP was made if
quantitative cultures reached ≥104 colony forming units/ml and/or
if ≥2% infected cells were enumerated on May–Grunwald Giemsa
stained cytocentifuged preparations.
Results A total of 433 BAL fluid samples was included. On week
days, a total of 69.8 ± 5.8 samples for each day were submitted,
compared with 38 and 46 samples on Saturday and Sunday. For
nearly one-half (199, 46.0%) of the samples, the onduty laboratory
technician was required: 99 (23.0%) samples arrived within 1 hour
before closing, and an additional 100 (23.0%) were submitted
after closing. VAP was diagnosed in 168 (38.8%) samples, 92
(54.8%) of these diagnoses were made after closing hours. VAP
was diagnosed in 76/220 (34.5%) of samples submitted during
opening hours, and tended to be diagnosed proportionally more
after closing hours during weekdays (54/129 41.8%) and during
weekends (38/84 samples, 45.2%; P = 0.09).
Discussion and conclusions The high number of BAL fluids
processed after laboratory opening hours is of concern because of
the suboptimal working conditions (fatigue, lack of supervision).
Technician time spent on these samples puts a strain on the
laboratory in terms of costs and absence of the technicians
because of legal recuperation. The low number of BAL fluids
submitted during the weekends combined with the higher
proportion of VAP in these samples points to poor compliance with
inhospital guidelines for the diagnosis of VAP and could suggest
that we missed a number of (unconfirmed) episodes of VAP.

Criteria of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome
in patients with community-acquired pneumonia

Center, Leninsk-Kuznetsky, Russian Federation
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P68 (doi:10.1186/cc4415)
The absence of a single approach to the determination of severe
pneumonia troubles the objective evaluation of the patients’ state.
It is proposed that the disease’s severity reflects the apportionment
of patients with pneumonia with systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS). This study was planned to demonstrate how the
clinical laboratory criteria of SIRS in pneumonia reflect the systemic
inflammatory response of the organism.
We examined 46 patients aged 36–58 years. Twenty-two patients
had the middle–severe type (first group) and 24 patients (second
group) had the severe type of pneumonia. We determined the
cytokine concentrations (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) and LPS-binding
protein (LPS-SP) in the blood serum using the immunochemo-
luminescent method on the immunochemoluminescent analyzer
‘IMMULITE One’ (USA) 1, 3, 10 and 17 days after the treatment’s
onset. The C-reactive protein concentration was appreciated by
the latex-agglutination method.
Digital material was treated using the Student t criterion.
Analysis of the clinical signs in patients with community-acquired
pneumonia demonstrated the expressed changes in patients with
severe pneumonia, which manifested in increased tachycardia,
respiratory failure, and decreased values of the systolic and
diastolic arterial pressures. The temperature reaction in the second
group remained during all the observation period.
The patients of the first group revealed segmentary infiltration,
whereas the patients of the second group had changes of the
pulmonary lobar lesion and polysegmentary changes.
The LPS-SP level in the severe type of pneumonia group exceeded
2.4 times as large as (P < 0.01) the one in the middle–severe type
of pneumonia group at admission to the hospital. By the 10th day
of observation the LPS-SP concentration in the blood decreased in

both groups, remaining significantly high in the second group as
compared with the first group (five times as large, P < 0.01), which
suggests the continuing stimulation of the LPS bacteria of the
monocytic macrophagal link cells and cytokine synthesis induction.
Patients of the second group demonstrated hypercytokinemia the
most expressed from the first to 10th observation day. At
admission the IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations exceeded 13 and 18.4
times as large as (P < 0.05) the values of the first group. The
maximal differences in the TNF-α levels between the groups were
observed on the third day.
An elevated level of C-reactive protein was registered in patients of
both groups. At the same time the C-reactive protein concentration
in the patients with severe type pneumonia exceeded four times as
large as (P < 0.05) the values of the compared group, which
suggested continuous induction of the protein synthesis by cytokines.
The LPS-SP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α concentrations in the blood of
patients with pneumonia therefore reflect the activity of the
systemic inflammatory process and make an important contribution
to the development of the whole complex of clinical symptoms
causing the state’s severity. The analysis of these values’ levels will
allow one to use them as the laboratory criteria of SIRS
appreciation in further studies.

Introduction Self-poisoning is a common cause of nontraumatic
coma, especially in young people. The management of these
patients aims to protect the airway in order to prevent aspiration
pneumonia (AP). Some author recommend to intubate when GCS
< 8. However, only few studies have examined the relation
between GCS, the caught reflex and the frequency of AP in self-
poisoning patients (SPP). The aim of our study is to evaluate the
relation between GCS and the risk of developing this complication.
Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective study
during 2004 including all admitted SPP in our ICU. GCS was
noted on admission or immediately before intubation. The diagnosis
of AP was performed according to the usual criteria. Two groups
were compared: G1 (without AP) and G2 (with AP). Data were
expressed as a mean ± SD and percentage. Tests used for
comparisons were the Q square and Student t tests. The ROC
curve was used to determinate the cutoff value of GCS associated
to high risk of AP.
Results Five hundred and twenty-four SPP were included.
Seventy-eight (14.9%) had developed AP. The characteristic of the
two groups are presented in Table 1. GCS was significantly lower
in G2. The cutoff value on the ROC curve was 12 with a sensitivity
of 86%, a specificity of 70% and an area under the curve of 0.816.
Conclusion Criteria used for intubation in SPP must be more

Hospital de Jerez, Spain
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P70 (doi:10.1186/cc4417)
Objective To describe etiologic agents, the antibiotic use and the
clinical outcome of pneumonia patients who require mechanical
ventilation
Methods Seventy-three consecutive mechanically ventilated
patients with suspected pneumonia and BAL recruited between
November 2003 and December 2005 were registered. The ICU
length of stay, time on mechanical ventilation (MV), mortality,
isolated bacteria, and antimicrobial susceptibility were collected.
Results Twelve inmunocompromised patients were excluded. A
total of 61 cases of suspected pneumonia were recruited
(Table 1), including eight (13.1%) cases of community-associated
pneumonia (CAP), 20 (32.7%) cases of early-onset ventilator-
associated pneumonia (VAP < 5 days), and 33 (54.09%) cases of
late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP ≥ 5 days).
Twenty-eight patients (84.8%) with late-onset VAP received
antibiotics before performing BAL, as compared with 12 (60%)
with early-onset VAP and five patients (71.4%) with CAP.
BAL was positive (>10,000 ufc/ml) in 36.4%, 60% and 14.3% of
late-onset VAP, early-onset VAP and CAP, respectively. The ICU
length of stay was significantly longer for patients with CAP and
late-onset VAP than for early-onset VAP patients. Mortality was
24.2%, 35% and 28.6% due to late-onset VAP, early-onset VAP
and CAP, respectively. CAP and early onset VAP were mostly
caused by antibiotic sensitive bacteria, while late-onset VAP were
caused more frequently by multiple pathogens with an inadequate
prior antibiotic treatment.
Conclusions The low incidence of positive BAL in the CAP group
underwrites the use of BAL only for particularly severe, selected
cases. Although there was a difference in the isolated bacteria and
antibiotic susceptibility among different kinds of pneumonia, the
mortality was the same. Inadequate prior antibiotic therapy was
more frequent in the late-onset VAP group.

Bronchoalveolar lavage cytology in the diagnosis of
ventilator-associated pneumonia

University Hospital Maastricht, The Netherlands
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P71 (doi:10.1186/cc4418)
Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common
nosocomial infection in intensive care patients. The most accurate
diagnosis relies on the quantitative culture results of broncho-
alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. In our hospital, BAL fluid quantitative
culture and cytology analysis are performed routinely in patients
suspected of VAP. In this study, we assessed the value of the
combination of various BAL fluid cytology findings for the diagnosis
of VAP.
Study design All BAL fluid samples obtained from patients
suspected of VAP were collected. VAP was defined as BAL fluid
cultures with ≥104 colony forming units/ml BAL fluid. BAL fluid
cytology included the total cell count/ml, the differential cell count
on 500 nucleated cells including the percentage of polymorpho-
nuclear neutrophils and the percentage of infected cells containing
phagocytised organisms (intracellular organisms [ICOs]). Areas
under the curve (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristic curves
were calculated and plotted for various cytologic parameters and
their combinations.
Results Over a 61-month period (January 1999–February 2004), a
total of 335 BAL fluid samples were included from 287 patients. In
126 (37.6%) patients VAP was confirmed by positive culture.
Highest AUCs were as follows: total cell count: 0.65, percentage
polymorphonuclear neutrophils: 0.71 and percentage ICO: 0.90.
The combination of percentage ICO with any other cytological
parameter did not increase the AUC. At a threshold of 2%, the
percentage ICO had an 86.2% positive predictive value and a
88.1% negative predictive value for VAP.
Conclusion Among all cytologic parameters analysed in BAL fluid
obtained under the suspicion of VAP, the percentage of ICOs was
the parameter most predictive of VAP. Combination with other
cytological parameters did not improve its predictive value.

Introduction Little is known about ICU use in severe community-
acquired pneumonia (SCAP). The aim of our study was to examine
epidemiological data, prognostic factors and treatment of adult
patients admitted to the ICU for SCAP in the industrial region of
Western Macedonia.
Methods Cases of SCAP admitted to the five general hospitals
covering the health services needs in the region were identified
retrospectively for the period April 2002–February 2005 using the
hospital admission forms. Data concerning SCAP treated on the
ICU were extracted by ICU records review over the same period.
Variables assessed included characteristics at presentation,
underlying risk factors, microbiological diagnosis, main therapies
and evolution during the ICU stay. Prognostic factors were
determined by comparison of the above variables between ICU
survivors and nonsurvivors.
Results Over this 3-year period 839 patients with SCAP were
admitted to the hospital, and the mean incidence of SCAP in
Western Macedonia was found to be 93 cases per 100,000
population. Of all patients admitted 45 (5.36%) needed intensive
care. Thirty-seven (84%) of those patients had comorbidity and 38
(84.9%) received early (<12 hour) intubation. The average age
was 60.48 (SD 16.46) years and the average APACHE II score,
PSI points and CURB-65 score were 23.1 (SD 8.9), 161.24
(SD 1.1) and 3.75 (SD 41.28), respectively. A microbiological
diagnosis was made in 11 patients (24,4%). Mortality was not
increased in those in whom a bacterial diagnosis was not made. A
total 4.4% of the strains were drug-resistant and the pathogens
most frequently identified were Acinetobacter baumanii,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klembsiella. ICU mortality was
33.3%. Prognostic factors on and during ICU admission were
confusion (P = 0.004), bilateral chest X-ray involvement (P = 0.001),
admission through the Emergency Department (P = 0.023), active
oral steroid treatment (P = 0.026), ineffective initial antimicrobial
therapy (P = 0.01), a longer median mechanical ventilation period
(13.66 days vs 6.26, P = 0.01), sepsis-related complications
(P = 0.001), ICU-related complications (P = 0.005) and acute
renal failure (P = 0.01).
Conclusion SCAP treated on the ICU carries a high mortality,
which is related to underlying diseases, ineffective initial anti-
microbial therapy, requirements for mechanical ventilation, bilateral
disease and complications during ICU stay. The importance of the
admission to ICU at an early time point is underlined. The approach
to empirical therapy must take into account local infecting
organisms and susceptibility.

Objectives Respiratory tract infections requiring mechanical
ventilation account for more than 50% of all infections treated in
the ICU and prolonged hospital stay and high ICU mortality [1-3].
Procalcitonin (PCT) may help to identify patients at increased risk
of worsening organ dysfunction associated with severe sepsis. The
goal of this study was to assess whether maximum PCT
concentrations are associated with deterioration of organ function.
Method PCT-7 is a multicenter, multinational, observational study
of the association of PCT levels with acute organ dysfunction and
28-day outcome in ICU patients with presumed or confirmed
pneumonia and requiring mechanical ventilation. Procalcitonin was
determined daily by LUMItest® (BRAHMS AG, Germany).
Results One hundred and ninety-seven patients (62.4% males)
were enrolled from January 2003 to November 2004 in eight
centers in Europe, the USA, and Canada. The mean age was 61.4
years (range 19–99); the mean APACHE II score was 23.7.
Patients with high PCT levels had higher mortality rates (PCT
cutoff: 2 ng/ml: odds ratio: 3.0 [95% CI: 1.4–6.4], P = 0.006; PCT

S32
cutoff: 4 ng/ml: odds ratio: 3.7 [95% CI: 1.8–7.8], P < 0.001).
There was a significant correlation between the maximum SOFA
score and the maximum PCT during the ICU stay (r = 0.57; 95%
CI: [0.45–0.66]; P < 0.001; n = 175). Both SOFA score and PCT
elevations at any day had an area under the curve >0.7 in the
receiver operator characteristic curve.
Conclusions In this first multicenter study on patients with
pneumonia, high levels of PCT identify patients with organ
dysfunction and a high risk of death.

Aim To evaluate diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of
procalcitonin (PCT) in comparison with C-reactive protein (CRP)
and other markers of inflammation phase reactants in relation to
clinical status and microbiology examinations.
Materials and methods A prospective study in ICU patients. One
hundred and sixty-four examinations of PCT, CRP, orosomucoid,
prealbumin, fibrinogen, INR, leukocyte and platelet count were
evaluated in 43 patients. The APACHE II score was calculated on
admission, the SOFA daily. SIRS, MODS, positivity of bacteriology,
hemoculture and apparent infection were also assessed. Statistical
methods comprised the chi-square test, Wilcoxon unpaired test,
nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test, ROC analysis and comparison
of area under the curve (AUC).
Results AUC is given for the following variables (only AUC > 0.6 is
mentioned). MODS: temperature 0.700, PCT 0.683, platelets
0.657. SIRS: temperature 0.852, leukocytes 0.761, PCT 0.694,
fibrinogen 0.612. SOFA: PCT 0.756, platelets 0.711, temperature
0.654, leukocytes 0.646. Hemoculture: albumin 0.703, fibrinogen
0.686, orosomucoid 0.666, temperature 0.649. APACHE II score:
platelets 0.685, PCT 0.605, leukocytes 0.602. Bacteriology:
temperature 0.653, PCT 0.627. Apparent infection: temperature
0.694, fibrinogen 0.680. There was a significant difference
between survivors and nonsurvivors with respect to ICU stay for
PCT (P = 0.00), platelets (P = 0.00), leukocytes (P < 0.03) and
temperature (P < 0.05).
Conclusions PCT was a more effective marker of sepsis-related
complications in ICU patients than CRP or other acute phase
reactants. ROC analysis was a suitable tool for confirmation of
these relations.

Introduction Procalcitonin (PCT) is a reliable measurable marker
of the clinical course in patients with infectious complications.
Nonspecific elevation of PCT concentrations may occur after major
surgeries or multiple trauma. Elevated concentrations of PCT were
detected after administration of some immunosuppressive drugs.
The aim of our study was compare PCT serum levels in patients
after liver, pancreas or simultaneous kidney–pancreas transplanta-
tions without any complications.
Patients and methods PCT serum levels were examined still
before induction of anesthesia, at 4 and 8 hours following graft
reperfusion, and daily until postoperative day 4. The patients were
divided into a group receiving polyclonal antibody ATG Fresnius
(21 patients with liver and 10 patients with simultaneous kidney–
pancreas transplantation) and one without it (seven patients with
liver and three patients with pancreas transplantation). PCT was
also determined in 12 patients undergoing liver resection. PCT
levels were evaluated using an imunoluminometric assay (ILMA)
with a LUMItest PCT kit (Brahms Diagnostics, Berlin, Germany)
with monoclonal antibodies against calcitonin and katacalcin
sequences, part of the PCT molecule.
Results PCT serum levels were slightly elevated (up to 13.90 ng/ml)
in several patients after liver transplantation without ATG therapy.
PCT was strongly induced in most cases in patients after liver
transplantation with ATG administration (up to 249.10 ng/ml). The
mean value of the maximum PCT concentration on the first
postoperative day was 4.49 ± 1.63 ng/ml in patients after liver
transplantation without ATG therapy and 59.08 ± 12.60 ng/ml in
patients with ATG therapy (P < 0.001). In addition, both groups
are compared with 12 patients undergoing liver resection, whose
mean serum PCT levels did not exceed 1.41 ± 0.29 ng/ml. Low
PCT serum concentrations (0.46 ± 0.10 ng/ml) occurred in
patients after pancreas transplantation without ATG treatment. A
very marked increase (139 ± 49.08) in serum PCT levels was
recorded in patients with simultaneous kidney–pancreas trans-
plantation with ATG administration.
Conclusion Polyclonal antibody administration to patients with liver
and simultaneous kidney–pancreas transplantation is associated
with a very marked increase in serum PCT levels, with peak values
on postoperative day 1. However, this is without a clinical correlate
in the form of a severe inflammatory response. The possible PCT
release following ATG therapy should be taken into account when
using this inflammatory parameter in transplant patients.

SIRS and MOFS. Severe polytrauma is one typical example of
SIRS without microbial infection, at least during the first days. High
PCT levels are often seen in multiple trauma, sometimes higher
than that seen in septic shock. The prognostic meaning of these
high PCT levels is practically unknown and has to be further
investigated.
Objective To assess the PCT levels during the first post-traumatic
days and correlate them with: the final outcome of the patient, the
injury severity score (ISS) and the expected mortality, and lactic
acid as a marker of tissue perfusion.
Materials and methods Over a period of 12 months (2003–
2004) 42 consecutive patients older than 18 years who were
admitted to the ICU of the KAT General Hospital for an expected
stay > 24 hours were prospectively included in the study. The
study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee.
Informed consent was obtained from the next of kin of unconscious
patients. All patients (mean age 27 years old) were intubated and
mechanically ventilated. From each enrolled patient blood was
withdrawn at the end of the first, second and third day to assess
the PCT and lactic acid levels. The modified ISS to predict
mortality, the kind and the severity of the injuries, and their final
outcome were also registered. The patients were divided into
group A, 23 patients who survived, and group B, 19 patients who
finally died.
Results The patients of group A had a mean ISS of 32.87 with
expected mortality 30.77%, and group B had ISS 35.45 with
expected mortality 34.57%. In group A the mean PCT levels of the
first day were 5.62 ng/dl, the second day 3.69 ng/dl and the third
day 2.13 ng/dl. There was a smooth decrease of the PCT over the
days and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.05). In
group B the first day mean values were 3.03 ng/dl, the second day
3.65 ng/dl and the third day 1.12 ng/dl. There was a sudden
increase over the second day and a statistically significant
decreased over the third day (P = 0.01). There were no
correlations between the PCT levels, the lactic acid levels, the ISS
and the expected mortality.
Discussion As seen in the literature, the patients who die from
trauma have higher PCT levels. But there are no comments on the
possible meaning of the value fluctuation during the first post-
traumatic days. In our study it seems that the initial PCT levels
were lower in the patients who died than in the patients who
survived. In group A the decrease of the PCT was linear over all
three days. But in the patients who died the PCT increased
suddenly the second day followed by a steep decrease on the third
day much lower than that seen in group A.
There is no known explanation of this phenomenon. One could
suggest that this is due to an immunity system malfunction that
allows patients to die late after a severe trauma. That has to be
proved.
Conclusion It seems that the high initial levels of PCT do not have
such a great prognostic value as has the alteration of the PCT
levels seen later during the next days.

Aim To compare the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT)
for early diagnosis and the discrimination of bacterial and viral
meningitis.
Methods A prospective, observational study involving 59 adults
(25 women, 34 men) who were hospitalized for acute meningitis.
The diagnosis of meningitis was based on compatible clinical
features and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. At admission the serum
and cerebrospinal fluid PCT levels were measured simultaneously
with a specific immunoluminometric assay (LUMItest Procalcitonin;
BRAHMS Diagnostica, Berlin, Germany). Fifteen patients had
bacterial meningitis, 44 viral meningitis, based on the detection of
pathogenic bacteria and the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.
Results PCT levels in patients with viral meningitis were not
significantly different in serum and cerebrospinal fluid
(0.20 ± 0.22 ng/ml, resp. 0.22 ± 0.25 ng/ml). PCT levels in
patients with bacterial meningitis were higher in serum and
cerebrospinal fluid compared with patients with viral meningitis
(1.04 ± 1.41 ng/ml, resp. 0.75 ± 0.46 ng/ml, P < 0.0001; resp.
P < 0.0005). PCT levels were not statistically different in serum
and cerebrospinal fluid in patients with bacterial meningitis. We did
not find a correlation between PCT levels and an impaired
cerebrospinal fluid–blood barrier. PCT levels were false negative in
five patients with bacterial meningitis (sensitivity of 66%). PCT
levels were correlated with the number of activating monocytes in
cerebrospinal fluid.
Conclusion PCT is of limited diagnostic value in patients suffering
from bacterial meningitis.

Background Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increase
rapidly after various inflammatory conditions, including surgery.
Although CRP measurements are used frequently in the ICU
setting, their relation to the development of sepsis, organ failure
and mortality is not well known.
Objective To correlate plasma CRP levels with prognosis and
hospital mortality in the postoperative period.
Design A prospective cohort study.
Setting A 19-bed medico-surgical ICU in a private hospital.
Patients All surgical patients admitted to the ICU over a period of
4 months.
Measurements and results In 2005, from September to
November, 527 patients were admitted to the ICU. Of them, 435
(82.5%) patients were admitted for postoperative care, and 219
(50.3%) were male. The mean age of the whole group was
62.02 ± 16 years. Nine (2.06%) patients died during the post-
operative period. Among the patients who died, the mean APACHE
and SAPS 2 scores were 17.67 ± 9.40 and 52.4 ± 18.31,
respectively. Among those who survived, the mean APACHE and
SAPS 2 scores were 12.11 ± 6.35 and 24.66 ± 13.03,
respectively. Plasma CRP levels during the first 3 days of the ICU
stay were not statistically different between patients who survived
and those who died. On the fourth day, the plasma CPR level was
significantly higher in the group who died, compared with those
who survived (28.133 ± 4.77 vs 13.849 ± 10.4; P = 0.037). Of
interest is the fact that, on admission, the APACHE and SAPS 2
scores were higher in the group who survived. The area under the
ROC curve for the analysis of plasma CRP levels on the fourth day
of the ICU stay was 0.86 (95% CI 0.76–0.96) with 100%
sensitivity and 75% specificity to predict death in surgical patients.
The best cutoff point was 22.7 mg%. The mortality in the groups
Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/10/S1
S34
with fourth-day PCR <22.7 mg% and ≥22.7 mg% was 0 and 25%,
respectively (P = 0.011).
Conclusion In this cohort, a plasma CPR level higher than
22.7 mg% on the fourth day of ICU admission was a good tool to
discriminate between patients who died and those who survived.
Plasma CRP levels appear to be better at predicting mortality than
the APACHE II and SAPS 2 scores at the time of ICU admission.

High C-reactive protein and low cholesterol levels are
prognostic marker in severe sepsis

Introduction Additional biomarkers in severe sepsis are needed to
tackle the challenges of determining prognosis and optimizing
selection of high-risk patients for application of therapy. The use of
serum cholesterol as a prognostic indicator of infection and
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and as a biologic marker for
resolution of systemic inflammation is less well defined. Proposed
explanations for the development of hypocholesterolemia include
downregulation of hepatic synthesis, dilutional effects with
resuscitation, loss of apoproteins in burns after blister formation,
and metabolic utilization. A number of inflammatory cells and
mediators involved in the inflammatory response have been
assessed for their role as potential markers of the presence and
severity of the inflammatory response and organ failure. Serum
levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute-phase protein
synthesized by the liver following stimulus by various cytokines
including tumor necrosis factor and IL-6, markedly increase within
hours after infection or inflammation.
Objective To evaluate serum CRP and cholesterol as a prognostic
factor for survival in patients with severe sepsis.
Methods Ninety-six patients meeting the criteria for severe sepsis.
A prospective study of mortality in patients with severe sepsis
whose serum levels of CRP and cholesterol were measured on
admission to an ICU, 2 days later and on the day of discharge from
the ICU or on the day of death.
Results The median cholesterol levels were significantly lower in
the nonsurvivor patients (first day 92.2 mg/dl [25.1], second day
92.1 mg/dl [21.7], died/discharge day 92.2 mg/dl [21.7]) than the
survivor patients (first day 175.1 mg/dl [38.6], second day
173.0 mg/dl [39.3], died/discharge day 171.8 mg/dl [39.6];
P < 0.001). The median CRP levels were significantly higher in the
nonsurvivor patients (first day 32 mg/dl [20.5–64.5], second day
33 mg/dl [22–74.5], died/discharge day 30 mg/dl [22–57]) than
the survivor patients (first day 10 mg/dl [6–14], second day
9 mg/dl [5–10], died/discharge day 6 mg/dl [3–9]; P < 0.001).
Conclusion Serum CRP and cholesterol are a predictor of survival
in patients with severe sepsis. Low cholesterol and high CRP
levels appear to be a valuable tool for individual risk assessment in
severe sepsis patients and for stratification of high-risk patients in
future intervention trials.

Introduction We have previously demonstrated changes in
circulating cytokines during the evolution of severe illness in ICU
patients. This pilot study aimed to measure changes in circulating
and urinary cytokines in critically ill patients receiving normal and
high-nitrogen enteral feeds.
Methods Patients (n = 40) were recruited from an adult, medical/
surgical ICU; urine and blood samples were obtained over three
consecutive days. TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and leptin were
measured by monoclonal antibody sandwich kit (ELISA). SIRS
criteria were applied using the white blood cell count, heart rate,
temperature and respiratory rate.
Results Urinary cytokine concentrations (u[…]) were significantly
raised in ICU patients relative to controls (at least P < 0.005). In
addition, higher u[TNF-α] (74%, P < 0.048) and u[IL-8] were
observed in the highest SIRS index group (n = 8). There was a
significantly higher u[IL-6] in the surgical group (n = 24) compared
with sepsis and trauma patients (P < 0.0005). Plasma leptin levels
(p[Lep]) increased with the duration of ICU stay. Urinary leptin was
readily detectable in ICU patients: this has not been reported
before. There was a marked elevation of u[Lep] (3.5-fold) in SIRS
relative to non-SIRS patients (P < 0.001). The mean u[IL-6] was
significantly decreased (45%, P < 0.01) in patients given a high
protein diet. There was a strong inverse correlation between
u[MCP-1] and dietary intake.
Conclusions Urinary measures have potential in monitoring the
ICU patient immune status noninvasively; urinary IL-8 and leptin
may be markers of SIRS; a high-protein diet appears to reduce
u[IL-6]; u[MCP-1] may be a marker of dietary delivery.

Attempt at simultaneous quantitative determination of
multiple cytokines and chemokines in peripheral blood
with a suspension array system

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P81 (doi:10.1186/cc4428)
Purpose Blood cytokine and chemokine values have been
examined in pathological analyses of surgical invasion, but making
multiple simultaneous measurements has been difficult from the
standpoint of cost, measurement time, specimen size, etc.
Microbead suspension arrays have been developed in recent
years, and they have made quantitative determination of multiple
substances possible.
Subjects and methods The subjects were 16 surgical patients with
severe septicemia secondary to peritonitis. The patients were divided
into groups according to whether their preoperative leukocyte count
was below 4000/µl (LW group) or 4000/µl or greater (HW group)
and changes between before and after surgery, and the changes
between before and after performance of postoperative endotoxin
adsorption therapy (PMX) were investigated.
The specimens consisted of frozen plasma, and the measurements
were made in 25 µl samples by Bio-Plex assays (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). The Wilcoxon test was used to perform the
statistical analysis.
Results There were five cases in the LW group, and 11 in the HW
group. There were no significant differences in age, interval
between onset of symptoms and arrival at the hospital, or APACHE
II scores, and the differences between groups in the operation time
and blood loss were not significant either. The difference between
groups in TNF-α was not significant, but the IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6,
IL-8, IL-10, and IL-13, G-CSF, GM-CSF, INF, MCP-1, and MIP-1β
values were significantly higher in the LW group both
preoperatively and postoperatively (P < 0.05). In the HW group
IL-12 and IL-17 tended to be higher before surgery. Before surgery
the Th1/Th2 ratio (INF/IL-4) was higher in the LW group, but after
Critical Care March 2006 Vol 10 Suppl 1 26th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine
S35
surgery it was higher in the HW group. Comparisons between
before and after PMX therapy showed a significant decrease in
endotoxin values (P = 0.03), but there were no significant changes
in cytokine or chemokine values.
Conclusion A decreased leukocyte count in peritonitis appeared
to reflect a state of increased cytokine response, especially an
increased response of the Th1 system. Postoperatively, however,
Th2 tended to predominate. PMX therapy had no effect on
cytokines. It appeared that this type of analysis will elucidate the
indications and optimal timing for PMX therapy and G-CSF and
INF administration in severe pathological states.

Objective To define a panel of biomarkers to aid in the assessment
and diagnosis of patients presenting to the Emergency Department
(ED) with suspected sepsis.
Population Patients presenting to the ED of 10 tertiary hospitals.
The inclusion criteria were: 18 years or older, and two or more
SIRS criteria with confirmed or suspected infection and/or lactate
> 2.5 mmol/l. The exclusion criteria were: cardiac arrest; Do Not
Resuscitate order; pregnancy.
Methods Blood samples were collected upon enrollment and the
plasma was frozen at –70°C within 1 hour. Measurement of
biomarkers was performed in a blinded fashion by immunoassay
(Biosite). The final diagnosis was determined based on standard
definitions. A search engine based on the optimization of the area
under the receiver–operator curve (ROC AUC) for diagnosis of
sepsis was used to select a panel of six biomarkers and to optimize
a Multimarker Index (MMX). The MMX combines the individual
marker values into a single index value for the sample, which is
reported as the test result.
Results The ROC AUC (95% CI) for the sepsis panel MMX for
differentiating patients with SIRS (n = 73) from those with various
sepsis conditions (n = 224), SIRS from all sepsis with positive
blood culture (n = 41), SIRS from severe sepsis (n = 43) and SIRS
from septic shock (n = 14) are, respectively, 0.76 (0.70–0.82),
0.85 (0.79–0.92), 0.89 (0.83–0.95) and 0.95 (0.91–0.99). For
comparison, the ROC AUCs obtained with CRP are 0.62
(0.54–0.70), 0.69 (0.59–0.79), 0.63 (0.53–0.74) and 0.71 (0.57–
0.85); for IL-6 the values are 0.64 (0.57–0.71), 0.69 (0.59–0.80),
0.66 (0.55–0.77) and 0.63 (0.45–0.82).
Conclusion The biomarker panel MMX shows clinical utility in
identifying sepsis as an underlying cause in patients presenting
with SIRS. Because this level of accuracy is attained based on the
first blood draw, these results suggest that it may be useful in the
rapid assessment and diagnosis of patients presenting to the ED.
These results need to be confirmed in additional populations.

The association of early lactate clearance with inflammatory
biomarkers in severe sepsis and septic shock

1Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA; 2Loma Linda University,
Loma Linda, CA, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P83 (doi:10.1186/cc4430)
Introduction Patients presenting to the hospital with sepsis with
evidence of hypoperfusion have a greater risk of developing organ
dysfunction and higher mortality [1]. Early recognition of
hypoperfused states and implementation of strategies to resolve
global tissue hypoxia as reflected by early lactate clearance
correlate with improved outcome and mortality [2]. This study is a
secondary analysis comparing early lactate clearance with serum
biomarkers among a cohort of patients collected during the Early
Goal Directed Therapy Trial (EGDT).
Methods Lactate levels were drawn on patients presenting with
severe sepsis and septic shock upon hospital presentation and at
6 hours after resuscitation. Lactate clearance was defined as the
decrease in blood lactate concentration from the baseline to the
6-hour value, expressed as a percentage of the baseline value [2].
Biomarkers were examined at baseline, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and
72 hours after hospital presentation. Biomarkers were determined
by immunoassay independently performed by Biosite®, Inc. (San
Diego, CA, USA). The Kruskal–Wallis statistic was used to detect
differences in mean (0–72 hours) biomarker levels among patients
stratified by lactate clearance quartiles. Chi-square analysis and
Kaplan–Meier mortality estimation were used to compare outcome
among the lactate clearance quartiles. The Student two-sample t
test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, chi-square and Kruskal–Wallis
statistics were employed to compare hospital survivors versus
nonsurvivors. A two-tailed probability level < 0.05 was accepted as
statistically significant.
Results Two hundred and forty-three patients were stratified into
quartiles by their level of lactate clearance after 6 hours. There was
a statistically significant inverse relationship between patients’
lactate clearance and the mean levels of each biomarker (TNF-α,
IL-1 receptor antagonist and caspase-3) over the first 72 hours of
hospitalization (P < 0.035). There was also a statistically
significantly higher hospital 28-day and 60-day mortality for each
quartile of decreasing lactate clearance (P < 0.010).
Conclusions Early resolution of global tissue hypoxia or greater
lactate clearance is associated with a corresponding decrease in
inflammatory mediators and mortality. The exact mechanism by
which early hemodynamic optimization modulates inflammation
requires further study.

Background Plasma levels of soluble E-selectin (sES) have been
shown to reflect the production of TNF, a proinflammatory cytokine
critically involved in the pathogenesis of various types of organ
failure in sepsis. We examined whether a newly developed rapid
immunoassay method for plasma sES is able to predict the
prevalence of organ failure including acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) in critically ill patients.
Methods Plasma samples were obtained from 50 critically ill
patients showing systemic inflammatory response syndrome
(SIRS) on admission to the emergency unit. Plasma levels of sES
were determined using a latex agglutination method.
Results The normal range of the plasma sES level was
4.8–29.7 ng/ml with this method. Among the patients examined,
22 patients showed elevated sES levels (DAE group) and 28
patients normal sES levels (DAN group). The prevalence of ARDS
was significantly higher in the DAE group (15/22, 68.2%) than in
the DAN group (4/28, 14.3%) (P < 0.001) and that of cardio-
vascular system failure, renal failure, and coagulation system failure
was also significantly higher in the DAE group than in the DAN
group in the first 5 days after admission. The mortality rate at
28 days after admission was significantly higher in the DAE group
(27.3%) than in the DAN group (0%) (P < 0.05).
Conclusion Determination of sES levels by this new rapid assay
method might be useful for prediction of the prevalence of organ
failure including ARDS and the outcome in critically ill patients
showing SIRS, a pathologic condition that has the potential risk for
development of multiple organ failure.

Bacterial recognition and induced cellular activation is fundamental
for the host control of infection, yet the limit between protective
and harmful response is still inexact. Forty-one patients were
enrolled in this study: 14 with sepsis, 12 with severe sepsis, and
15 with septic shock. Seventeen healthy volunteers (HV) were
included as controls. The expression of TLR2, TLR4, CD14,
CD11b and CD11c was analyzed on monocyte surfaces in whole
blood. sCD14 was measured in serum and TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10
cytokine levels were measured in PBMC supernatants following
LPS, IL-1β and TNF-α stimuli by ELISA. An increase in sCD14 and
a decreased mCD14 were found in patients as compared with HV
(P < 0.001). However, no differences in the expression of TLR2,
TLR4 and CD11c were found among the groups. A trend towards
differential expression of CD11b was observed, with higher values
found in patients with sepsis as compared with HV. A negative
regulation of the inflammatory cytokine production was observed in
severe sepsis and shock septic patients in relation to the sepsis
and HV, regardless of the stimulus. No significant difference in
IL-10 production was found among the groups. In this study we
show that the inflammatory response is associated with the
continuum of clinical manifestations of sepsis, with a strong
inflammatory response in the early phase (sepsis) and a refractory
picture in the late phases (severe sepsis and septic shock).
Correlation between cell surface receptors and cytokine
production after IL-1β and TNF-α stimuli and the observation of a
single and same standard response with the different stimulus
suggest a pattern of immunology response that is not dependent
only on the expression of the evaluated receptors and that is likely
to have a regulation in the intracellular signaling pathways.

Introduction Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in the ICU.
Sepsis morbidity and mortality are increasing through the years.
Infection control depends on adequate microbe recognition and
satisfactory cell activation. Paradoxically it has been seen that in
sepsis cell activation can be both good and harmful to the host.
Objectives To evaluate neutrophil activation in the continuum of
sepsis measuring cell surface receptors and oxidative metabolism;
to evaluate monocyte activation measuring oxidative metabolism;
and to evaluate the correlation between cell activation and organ
dysfunction.
Methods Regarding the 1992 ACCP/SCCM consensus, 41
patients were included: 14 with sepsis, 12 with severe sepsis and
15 with septic shock. Seventeen healthy volunteers were included
as the control group. TLR2, TLR4, CD11b, CD11c and CD66b
expression on the neutrophil surface using whole blood were
measured using flow cytometry. Reactive oxygen species formation
due to DCFH oxidation was also measured by flow cytometry.
Organ dysfunction was characterized and measured using the
SOFA score.
Results Diminished TLR2 and TLR4 expression was observed in
septic shock compared with healthy volunteers (P = 0.05 and
P = 0.06, respectively). There were no differences found in CD11b
and CD11c expression. CD66b expression was increased when
comparing the whole group of patients and the control group
(P = 0.01). The neutrophil oxidative burst was increased in the
whole group of patients compared with the control group at
baseline and under PMA, fMLP, LPS and S. aureus stimulation
(P < 0.001 for all conditions tested). The monocyte oxidative
metabolism was also significantly increased in the whole patient
group compared with the control group in all conditions tested
(P < 0.01). Neutrophil and monocyte oxidative metabolism due to
PMA, LPS and S. aureus stimulation in severe sepsis were
diminished compared with sepsis and septic shock. A strong
correlation was observed between neutrophil and monocyte
oxidative metabolism. The SOFA score discriminated patients
between survivors and nonsurvivors (ROC curve was 0.78;
P = 0.02). A positive correlation was observed between organ

dysfunction and oxidative metabolism in neutrophils and
monocytes considering severe sepsis and septic shock. However,
despite an oxidative burst in sepsis as high as in septic shock, no
organ dysfunction was found in sepsis.
Conclusions Neutrophils and monocytes are activated in the
continuum of sepsis considering reactive oxygen species
formation. Nonetheless, in the onset of sepsis increased oxidative
metabolism was probably involved in resolution of the infectious
course, but in the late stages of sepsis it was associated with
tissue damage and, consequently, organ dysfunction and death.

Introduction The response to an inflammatory stimulus is highly
variable in critically ill patients and may differ from that of healthy
volunteers. One of several distinguishing characteristics between
the two groups is an elevated plasma level of cytokines in patients.
We hypothesized that an acute elevation in TNF-α, as evoked by a
priming dose of purified Escherichia coli endotoxin (LPS), would
enhance the inflammatory response to LPS, and we investigated
this hypothesis in healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind,
crossover design.
Methods Following approval by the local Human Ethics Committee,
13 volunteers underwent three interventions each, receiving two
bolus injections, spaced 90 min apart and consisting of either
saline + LPS (0.2 ng/kg) (LPS-0.2), saline + LPS (0.4 ng/kg)
(LPS-0.4), or LPS (0.2 ng/kg) + LPS (0.2 ng/kg) (LPS-0.2+0.2).
Physiological variables were monitored throughout until 8 hours
after the last dose; blood samples were drawn for measurement of
plasma TNF-α, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell
(WBC) and differential counts. Interventions were spaced at least
1 month apart. A repeated-measures multivariate ANOVA (inter-
vention-by-time) with Bonferroni corrections was performed.
P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results Flu-like symptoms occurred during all three interventions;
the frequency was increased in groups LPS-0.4 and LPS-0.2+0.2
as compared with LPS-0.2. The heart rate, body temperature,
CRP, WBC, and the neutrophil count increased more, and the
lymphocyte count was more reduced, during LPS-0.2+0.2
compared with both LPS-0.2 and LPS-0.4. Levels of TNF-α and
IL-6 were higher during LPS-0.2+0.2 (mean peak TNF-α ±, 44.6
[95% CI, 25.8–63.3] mg/l) compared with LPS-0.4 (28.0
[16.8–39.3] mg/l) and LPS-0.2 (12.7 [6.1–19.3] mg/l)
(P < 0.001), as well as during LPS-0.4 compared with LPS-0.2.
Conclusion In healthy humans, induction of a low-grade
inflammatory response by a priming bolus injection of LPS
amplifies the clinical and paraclinical inflammatory response to a
subsequent LPS injection. This may explain the potent
proinflammatory response seen in some critically ill patients.

The effect of systemic iNOS inhibition during human
endotoxemia on the development of TLR-tolerance in vitro

University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P88 (doi:10.1186/cc4435)
Introduction The phenomenon of repeated exposure to endotoxin
resulting in diminished release of proinflammatory cytokines is
called endotoxin tolerance. After receiving a low-dose pretreatment
with endotoxin, tolerant animals survive a challenge with a ‘lethal
dose’ of endotoxin. Recent studies suggests a pivotal role for NO
arising from iNOS in the development of tolerance. Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) are receptors that recognize specific pathogen-
associated molecular patterns. Ten members of the so-called TLR
family have been identified in humans, and several of them appear
to recognize specific microbial products, including LPS (TLR-4),
peptidoglycan (TLR-2) and flagelline (TLR-5). Recognition leads to
activation of intracellular signaling pathways, which upregulate a
wide array of inflammatory modulators that contribute to the early
host cell response. The aim of this study was to test whether
administration of the selective iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine during
human experimental endotoxemia influences the development of
tolerance to several TLR-agonists in vitro.
Methods Seventeen healthy volunteers (age 22.2 ± 1.8 years)
were treated with an i.v. bolus injection of 2 ng/kg Escherichia coli

LPS in the absence (n = 10) or presence (n = 7) of the selective
iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (bolus of 370 mg and continuous
infusion 1 mg/min 1 hour after administration of LPS). Whole blood
was stimulated in vitro with different TLR agonists before, and 2
and 4 hours after LPS treatment. The TLR agonists used were Pam
3 Cys, 1 µg/ml (TLR-2); Poly I:C, 50 µg/ml (TLR-3); E. coli LPS,
1 ng/ml (TLR-4); Flagelline, 10 ng/ml (TLR-5); and Loxoribine,
50 µg/ml (TLR-7). The samples were incubated at 37ºC for
24 hours, after which cell-free supernatant was obtained (centrifu-
gation at 2000 × g at 4°C for 15 min) and stored at –80°C until
ELISAs were performed.
Results In-vitro incubation with the different TLR-agonists resulted
in release of cytokines in blood samples taken prior to the LPS
administration in vivo. The cytokine release was attenuated 2 and
4 hours after LPS administration in vivo (see Fig. 1a). This develop-
ment of tolerance occurred in TLR-3, TLR-4, TLR-5 stimulated
whole blood. In-vivo administration of the iNOS inhibitor amino-
guanidine had no significant effect on the development of
tolerance in TLR-3 and TLR-4 stimulated whole blood, but TLR-5
agonist stimulated whole blood showed that tolerance was
inhibited (P < 0.05; see Fig. 1b).
Conclusions LPS administration in vivo attenuates the in-vitro
cytokine response on various TLR-agonists. Inhibition of iNOS in
vivo had no effect on the development of tolerance in TLR-3 and
TLR-4 stimulated whole blood, but tolerance diminished in TLR-5
agonist stimulated whole blood. This suggests that NO is involved
in the development of tolerance to flagelline.

G-CSF is an endothelial survival factor in LPS-induced
inflammatory conditions

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P89 (doi:10.1186/cc4436)
Background Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may
induce stem cell mobilization and stimulates myelopoiesis.
Functionally, G-CSF upregulates myeloid cell survival and effector
function (e.g. phagocytosis, Fc-mediated killing, etc.). G-CSF has
been discussed to play a role in the protection of endothelial cells
and anti-apoptosis via bcl-2 family protein, caspase 9 and cIAPs.
We were therefore interested to test the effect of G-CSF on
endothelial cell viability in the presence and absence of
granulocytes (PMN) with and without activation by bacterial
endotoxin (LPS).
Methods Endothelial monolayers were established from bone
marrow and layers were preincubated with rhG-CSF (filgrastim,
3000 U/ml) for 24 hours. PMN isolated from patients with septic
shock or healthy donors were incubated with or without LPS
(E. coli 0111:B4, 100 ng/ml); or were preactivated with LPS, then
washed before being cocultured with the endothelial layer for
another 24 hours. As a measure for cell viability, we quantified ATP
contents by luciferin-based chemiluminescence. The inflammatory
response by endothelial cells and/or PMN was studied by
measuring IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α released into the culture
supernatant.
Results In G-CSF treated endothelial/PMN co-cultures as well as
in G-CSF substituted cultures of PMN alone, the ATP content in
cell lysates was upregulated. This G-CSF effect was independent
from the addition of exogenous LPS. PMN as well as LPS
stimulated the cytokine release by endothelial cells. We found IL-6
levels ranging between 1 and 1054 pg/ml being exclusively
secreted by endothelial cells, and IL-8 levels originating from PMN
and endothelial cells between 55 and 3278 pg/ml, respectively.
G-CSF had no effect on IL-6 levels but downmodulated IL-8 in all
endothelial/PMN co-cultures as well as PMN cultures alone. All
IL-1β levels were close to detection levels and TNF-β levels were in
the range of 5–20 pg/ml. This indicates that PMN preparations
were not significantly contaminated by monocytes or
macrophages. This was confirmed by morphological examination.
Conclusion G-CSF increases the ATP content in both
endothelial/PMN co-cultures and PMN cultures alone even if LPS
or LPS-treated PMN are added, to mirror an inflammatory
response. Moreover, G-CSF attenuates levels of the inflammatory
cytokine IL-8, but does not modulate IL-6.

Introduction Naloxone has been proposed to treat septic shock.
We assessed by flow cytometry its effect in vitro on phagocytose
(PH) and burst oxidation (BO) of neutrophils and monocytes after
various stimuli in 10 healthy volunteers.
Methods Whole blood was incubated with or without naloxone at
a range of concentrations used in septic shock (2 × 10–4, 2 × 10–5,
2 × 10–6, 2 × 10–7 M). We added dihydrorhodamine 123 to mark
H2O2 production. We stimulated the cells by either propidium
iodide stained S. aureus, E. coli or C. albicans, or by phorbol-
myristate-acetate (PMA). We used an index of PH and an index of
BO. As H2O2 production depends on PH and on BO, we defined a
global index (GI) of its final production taking those two parameters
into account.

Conclusion Naloxone inhibits significantly in a dose-dependant
manner the production of H2O2 in both neutrophils and monocytes
at concentrations used in septic shock, but its influence on PH and
BO is different according to the applied stimulus.

A lack of Toll-like receptor 4 expression variability in the
immediate preoperative period: a pilot study of elective
surgical patients

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), a receptor of innate immunity, provides
the site for the lipopolysaccharide shell of Gram-negative organisms
to bind and initiate the inflammatory cascade in sepsis. Its
expression has been studied in various disease states (sepsis,
asthma, atherosclerosis, immunodeficiencies), ethnic groups
(Chinese, Irish, Scottish, Gambian), ages, level of physical training,
gestational status, and trauma. The expanding body of evidence in
regard to TLR signaling is demonstrating the importance between
such signaling and human disease. A translational research project
between the Departments of Anesthesiology and Medical
Microbiology and Immunology was initiated to determine any
difference in the amount of TLR-4 expression in elective
preoperative patients in regard to height, weight, age, sex, and body
surface area (BSA), body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and
diabetes. Race was not analyzed. After institutional research board
approval, a prospective study of the blood specimens of 52
consecutive, elective, preoperative patients was performed. The
blood was directly decanted into a PAXgene Blood RNA tube
(Qiagen) designed for the stabilization of RNA from whole blood.
Whole blood RNA was extracted using the PAXgeneTM Blood
RNA System (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechitikon, Switzerland), including
treatment with DNase I to prevent genomic DNA contamination.
Quantification of TLR-4 expression levels in human lymphocytes
was by RT-PCR and results compared with standard curves.
Pearsons’s correlation coefficient was use for statistical analysis of
the continuous variables and t-testing was used in the analysis of
the categorical variables. The TLR-4 concentration varied from
0.211 to 2.490 fmol/µl per cDNA; however, there was no statistical
significance between the concentration of TLR-4/cDNA expressed
by RT-PCR and the continuous variables (height, weight, BMI, BSA,
and age) nor the categorical variables (hypertension, diabetes, and
sex) (Table 1). None of the patients had postoperative infections.
This was an initial attempt to quantify the TLR-4 receptor expression
by elective patient variable preoperatively. It provided an opportunity
for anesthesiologists to take their practice to the laboratory to
explore the immunologic basis of their actions.

Background Sepsis remains the leading cause of death in
noncardiologic ICUs. Genetic predispositions of patients play an
important role in the control of inflammatory response. We have
recently reported that cDNA microarrays can be used to identify
typical gene expression profiles in patients with severe sepsis
despite strong interindividual differences. The aim of the present
study was therefore to evaluate whether center-dependent effects
on the gene expression pattern exist, whether diagnostically
relevant gene expression profile can be identified, and which genes
are important during the systemic inflammatory response.
Materials and methods Twenty-nine patients were enrolled from
one German and three Czech hospitals. The ACCP/SCCM
consensus conference definition was applied to predict the severity
of sepsis in ICU patients. As controls we used 18 post spinal or
bypass surgery patients, respectively, without signs of inflammation.
Gene expression was measured using the inhouse research
microarray of SIRS-Lab GmbH Jena (Germany), which comprised
probes for 5226 human genes relevant to inflammation, immune
response and related processes. The experiments were performed
according to MIAME guidelines.
In order to reveal genes differentially expressed during sepsis and
to assess the effects sample collection from different centres have
on the data, we applied, gene by gene, the two-way analysis of
variance to the normalised expression data. Furthermore, the
q-value was estimated, thus controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR) occurring in multiple comparisons.
Results A set of 213 genes was obtained, for which the gene
expression significantly varied between sepsis and control patients,
similarly in both centers (FDR < 0.1). In this set, 88 genes were
upregulated and 125 genes were downregulated in sepsis patients
compared with the controls.
Conclusions The present data indicate that microarray technology
is suitable for systematically identifying those genes that underlie
the attenuated inflammatory response in sepsis. Gene expression
profiles were able to distinguish between infectious and non-
infectious systemic inflammatory response, despite a magnitude of
center-associated effects. The participation of genes involving in
the control of inflammatory response indicated a necessity of tight
control of inflammatory response and has a potential impact for
future diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.

present study examined whether ketamine decreased cytokine
production and improved survival after burn or after burn combined
with sepsis.
Methods In groups 1–4, rats sustained burn injury at time 0, and
were given ketamine (10 mg/kg) or saline at 1 or 24 hours post
burn. In groups 5–8 we created a ‘two hit’ model of burn followed
by sepsis. Rats that sustained burn at time 0 were given E. coli
(0.2 × 109 CFU) at 24 h. The animals received ketamine or saline
at 1 or 24 hours post burn. In all the above groups mortality was
recorded for 7 days and IL-6 was measured in serum at 6 and
30 hours post burn.
Results Ketamine given at 1 hour (but not 24 hours) after burn
injury decreased serum IL-6 concentrations compared with saline
(430.0 ± 36.71 vs 106.5 ± 3.403 pg/ml [mean ± SEM], P < 0.0001)
without altering survival. After burn followed by sepsis, ketamine
given at 1 hour tended to improve survival and decrease IL-6, and
when given at 24 hours (i.e. immediately after E. coli inoculation)
significantly improved survival (46.1% vs 13.3%, P = 0.008) and
decreased IL-6 (72,640 ± 40,990 vs 332,300 ± 32,300 pg/ml,
P = 0.0079).
Conclusion We conclude that ketamine therapy improves survival
in burn followed by sepsis. This beneficial effect probably is
achieved by interfering with the inflammatory cascade, as
evidenced by attenuation of cytokine concentrations.

Role of calcium regulation in vascular hyporeactivity
induced by peritonitis-associated septic shock

The norepinephrine (NE)-induced contraction contains two
components: Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
as the fast (F) phase, and Ca2+ influx via a voltage-dependent
calcium channel on the membrane as the slow (S) phase. This
study was to evaluate the role of Ca2+ handling in vascular
hyporeactivity to NE using functional isometric tension recording
experiments in isolated septic rat aorta and mesenteric artery. The
sepsis was induced by cercal ligation and puncture (CLP) and the
vascular tissues were removed at the late phase of sepsis (i.e.
18 hours after CLP). Our results showed that rats which received
CLP for 18 hours manifested severe hypotension and vascular
hyporeactivity to NE in vivo. In addition, in-vitro studies showed
that the vascular hyporeactivity to NE was not only observed in the
aorta but also in the mesenteric artery obtained from the CLP-
induced sepsis rat, and is more severe in the small resistance
artery. Both the F phase and S phase of NE-induced contraction
were reduced in aortas and mesenteric arteries from sepsis rats.
The addition of 2.5 mM Ca2+ into Ca2+-free solution restored the
NE-induced contraction in aortas to the level of that in normal
Krebs’ solution in both groups, while a delayed contraction
occurred in the mesenteric artery from the CLP group. In order to
clarify what possible mechanisms contribute to the abnormal
calcium handling in sepsis, inhibitors of calcium channel and
release were used. The inhibition of 2-aminoethoxy-diphenyl borate
(2-APB), ryanodine, and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) on the NE-
induced contraction in Ca2+-free solution were greater in the aorta
from septic rats, and inhibitions of CPA and ryanodine, but not of
2-APB, were attenuated by nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor
Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. In addition, the attenuation of NE-
induced contraction by nifedipine in the aorta was also greater in
the CLP group. Our results therefore suggest that vascular
hyporeactivity to NE in the CLP-induced sepsis is caused by a
major decrease of SR function and a minor impairment of voltage-
dependent Ca2+ channels on membrane to Ca2+ handling in aortas
and mesenteric arteries of rats, and this could be attributed to the
overproduction of NO in sepsis.

Microcirculatory hyporesponsiveness in
lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation is endothelial
cell dependent but calcium independent
Y Ouellette
Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P95 (doi:10.1186/cc4442)
Background Two hallmarks of sepsis are decreased vascular
resistance and hyporeactivity to vasoconstrictor agents in the
microcirculation. Whether the impairment in vasoreactivity is
caused by defects in the signal transduction pathway inherent to
endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells remains unclear.
Objective The aim of this study was to determine whether impaired
vasoreactivity during LPS-induced inflammation is associated with
altered Ca2+ sensitivity of contractile proteins in small mesenteric
resistance arteries (SMRA).
Methods LPS (15 mg/kg) or sterile water was injected
intraperitoneally into mice. SMRAs were harvested 18 hours after
injection. The arterioles (~190–220 µm) were mounted on a
pressure myograph, superfused with MOPS buffer at 37°C, and
loaded with fura-2. The arteriolar diameter and global intracellular
Ca2+ were measured concurrently using light microscopy and a
photomultiplier system. Concentration–response curves to
phenylephrine (PE) (10–9 to 10–4 M) were conducted. In all
experiments, n = 4–6; *P < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.
Results LPS treatment resulted in hyporesponsiveness to PE as
demonstrated with an increase in EC50 (0.7 ± 0.2 µM vs
1.9 ± 1.0 µM*), a decrease in maximal contractile response (Emax
35 ± 6% vs 19 ± 9%*) and a reduction in Ca2+ sensitivity (Fig. 1,
left). Removal of the endothelium resulted in a near-normal response
to PE in LPS-treated mice (EC50 0.9 ± 0.2 µM vs 1.0 ± 0.6 µM
and Emax 43 ± 2% vs 38 ± 5%). Interestingly, Ca2+ sensitivity
remained decreased in SMRAs from LPS-treated mice (Fig. 1, right).
Conclusions In small resistance arteries, LPS-induced inflam-
mation results in endothelial cell dependent hyporesponsiveness to
vasoconstrictors in association with, but independent of, a
decreased Ca2+ sensitivity within the smooth muscle cells. This
suggests that, in the microcirculation, endothelial cells moderate
contractility function without affecting calcium sensitivity within the
smooth muscle cells.

Background Imipenem is frequently used in ICUs to treat
nosocomial infections. As infections mainly occur in tissue extra-
cellular fluid, unbound antibiotic concentrations in this
compartment are responsible for the antimicrobial effect. Micro-
dialysis allows the measurement of unbound antibiotic
concentrations. The aim of this study was to investigate the
imipenem distribution in the blood, muscle and lung by micro-
dialysis in a rat model of A. baumannii pneumonia, by comparing
unbound concentrations between tissues and blood.
Method Three days before the pharmacokinetic experiment, seven
rats were rendered neutropenic by cyclophosphamide intra-
peritoneal administration (150 mg/kg body weight). The day before
the experiment, under isoflurane anaesthesia, rats were equipped
with a femoral vein catheter, an internal jugular vein and a muscle
microdialysis probe. At the end of this surgery, animals were
infected intratracheally with an A. baumannii suspension
(107 CFU/ml). The day of the experiment, after tracheotomy and
thoracotomy under isoflurane anaesthesia, the lung microdialysis
probe was inserted. The study was conducted under inhaled
anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation. Imipenem recoveries in the
three media were determined in each rat by retrodialysis by drug
before imipenem administration (30 mg/kg over 30 min intra-
venously), then microdialysis samples were collected during
150 min. At the end of experiment, after euthanasia, the lungs were
removed and a quantitative bacteriological study was performed to
confirm pneumonia.
Results Decay of free concentrations in the blood, muscle and lung
over time were monoexponential and the concentration profiles in
these three media were virtually superimposed (Fig. 1). Accordingly,
AUC tissue (muscle and lung) to AUC blood ratios were virtually
equal to 1. Compared with values previously determined in non-
infected rats, a higher interindividual variability was observed in
these three media for all the pharmacokinetic parameters, probably
due to the immunodeficiency and/or infection [1].
Conclusion In this rat model of A. baumannii pneumonia, the
imipenem distribution in the lung and muscle could be predicted
from unbound blood concentrations since unbound blood, muscle
and lung concentrations were superimposed.

Objective Sepsis increases morbidity and mortality of burn victims
with smoke inhalation. Since septic patients are usually on an
antibiotic, we felt that antimicrobial therapy was appropriate to
make our model clinically relevant. Because P. aeruginosa is a
frequent cause of pneumonia/sepsis, we hypothesized that a
combination of potent antipseudomonas antibiotics, such as
ciprofloxacin and piperacillin, would improve the outcome of septic
shock in sheep.

Methods Sixteen sheep were surgically prepared for study. After a
tracheotomy, acute lung injury/sepsis was induced by 48 breaths
of cotton smoke inhalation and instillation of P. aeruginosa (2–5 ×
1011 CFU) into the lung. After the injury all sheep were awakened,
mechanically ventilated, and resuscitated with Ringer’s lactate
solution. Animal groups: sham (n = 6, non-injured, nontreated);
control (n = 5: injured, untreated); treated (n = 5: injured, treated
with ciprofloxacin [0.4 g, every 12 hours] plus piperacillin [3 g,
every 6 hours]). Antibiotics were intravenously administered
starting 6 hours after the insult. The animals were sacrificed if they
matched the termination criteria or survived over 96 hours.
Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA, significance was
P < 0.05 *within group, †between groups. Data are the mean ± SEM.
Results Cardiopulmonary variables were stable in the sham group
and the survival rate was 100%. All injured sheep reached criteria
for sepsis 6 hours postinjury. The mean survival time was
significantly improved in the treatment group compared with the
injured group (23 hours in control group vs 83 hours† in treatment
group). The control group showed a significant decrease in
PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and mean arterial pressure (MAP, mmHg),
left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI, g × m m–2 beat–1), and
systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI, dynes sec cm–5 m–2).
The treatment group also showed a fall in the P/F ratio, MAP,
LVSWI, and SVRI that was significantly improved after 18 hours
compared with control (Table 1).

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P98 (doi:10.1186/cc4445)
Introduction Pathophysiological human studies in sepsis are
difficult to perform due to ethical and methodological concerns. In
this context, animal models of severe sepsis can be useful to better
understand this condition and to test new therapeutic interventions.
Objective The purpose of this study was to describe and
characterize a clinically relevant experimental model of septic
shock in pigs that could be useful to test different therapeutic
interventions.
Methods Five White Large pigs (35–45 kg) were anesthetized and
instrumented with arterial and Swan–Ganz catheters. A splenectomy
was performed and sepsis was induced by peritoneal instillation of
1.5 g/kg fecal content. Several biochemical indicators of organ
dysfunction as well as infectious parameters were measured. The
animals were followed until death, when fragments of the heart,
small bowel, liver and kidney were removed for pathology. Three
nonseptic animals served as controls.
Results The animals survived 17 hours on average (range
16–18 hours). Septic shock was characterized as a significant
increase in heart rate (102 ± 27 baseline vs 139 ± 16 bpm before
death, P < 0.001) and a decrease in mean arterial pressure
(111 ± 9 vs 62 ± 9 mmHg, P = 0.009). Septic pigs developed a
nonsignificant decrease in cardiac output (109.4 ± 54.5 vs
71.2 ± 20.1 ml/min/kg, P = 0.221) and mixed venous oxygen
saturation (74 ± 2 vs 34 ± 13%, P = 0.110) during the study
period. These animals were fully resuscitated (mean 12.2 ± 2.4 l
Ringer lactate) as evidenced by stable values of central venous
pressure (12.8 ± 2.4 vs 20.4 ± 7.4 mmHg, P = 0.905) and wedge
pressure (11.4 ± 6 vs 19.0 ± 3.6 mmHg, P = 0.903). E. coli was
recovered from blood cultures of all the septic animals. Although
biochemical data did not demonstrate important organ dysfunction,
some pigs developed clinical signs of organ injury, such as oliguria.
Histology depicted only focal or minor abnormalities. Control
animals were sacrificed 24 hours after surgery without developing
significant changes in hemodynamic, respiratory or metabolic
variables.
Conclusion Fecal peritonitis in pigs is a reliable and clinically
relevant model of sepsis that can be useful to test several different
therapeutic interventions.

Introduction The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate the
incidence of nosocomial infection (NI) in ICU patients with head
injury (HI) and to analyse the main characteristics of these
infections.
Methods We studied retrospectively 58 ICU patients with HI (48
men, 10 women) who developed NI. Mean age: 41.4 ± 13.8 years.
Mean stay: 31.2 ± 18.4 days. These patients developed 74
episodes of NI diagnosed according to CDC criteria. Early-onset
(EO) NI occurred within the first 96 hours of the ICU stay (14
episodes) and late-onset (LO) NI occurred later than 96 hours from
admission (60 episodes). Mean APACHE II score at admission:
15.1 ± 10.2. All were mechanically ventilated.
Results We diagnosed the following NI: 46 pneumonias (11 EO
and 35 LO), 22 central venous catheter-related infections
(CVC-RI) (all LO), one urinary tract infection (LO) and five central
nervous system infections (CNSI) (three EO and two LO). The
main pathogens were: P. aeruginosa 38%, A. baumannii 31%,
MRSA 18%, K. pneumoniae 9%, MSSA 4%. In 10 episodes of NI
(13.5%) two microbes were isolated. There was no difference
between pathogens isolated in EO and LO pneumonias. Mortality
rates (MR): 18/58 = 31%.
Conclusion The most frequent NI in ICU patients with HI was
pneumonia (62.2%). We noticed an important increase in CVC-RI
(29.7%) especially during the last 2 years; all were LO NI with

good prognosis. The most common pathogens were
P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and MRSA (totally 87%); during the
last years the incidence of MRSA-NI increased significantly.
A. baumannii was isolated especially in younger patients and
almost never in the elderly. Pneumonias (P < 0.05) and CNSI
(P < 0.05) increased MR, while no difference was seen between
EO and LO pneumonias.

Background The treatment of infections caused by multidrug-
resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms poses a therapeutic
challenge. With a diminishing armamentarium of effective new
chemotherapeutic agents, there has been renewed interest in the
polymyxins, which had fallen out of favour due to nephrotoxicity and
neurotoxicity reported during their use in the 1960s.
Aim Epidemiological analysis of the use of colistin in the treatment
of MDR infections in an ICU.
Patients and methods We prospectively recorded the clinical and
microbiological efficacy, and safety profile of colistin (polymyxin E)
in the treatment of MDR Gram-negative bacterial infections in an
ICU, during a period of 18 months. Patients were treated with
intravenous and/or aerosolized colistin.
Results Twenty-eight critically ill patients received a total of 33
courses of colistin administered in combination with another anti-
microbial agent (mainly carbapenems or β-lactamase inhibitors).
The patients’ mean age was 66 years (range 29–84). Nineteen
patients were male and nine female. Their mean APACHE II score
was 18 (range 10–29). The infections treated were: 19
pneumonias (of which five had concurrent bacteremia), seven
catheter-related bacteremias, three cases of peritonitis, one
primary bacteremia, one infection of the catheter tip (without
bacteremia) and one urinary tract infection. In one case the use of
colistin was empirical. The responsible bacteria were
Acinetobacter baumanii (47%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50%)
and Klebsiella pneumonia (3%). The mean duration of colistin
therapy was 14 days (range 2–36 days). The end of treatment
mortality was 30%, and overall mortality at discharge was 48%.
Nephrotoxicity was observed in two patients (7%) and
neurotoxicity in one (3.5%). Both adverse events were reversible
and had no serious outcomes.
Conclusion Colistin in combination with other antimicrobials can
be considered a reasonable and safe treatment option for MDR
Gram-negative respiratory tract infections in the setting of limited
therapeutic options.

Introduction Colistin has been recently reintroduced in clinical
practice, because of the increasing prevalence of multiresistant
Gram-negative strains in ICUs. There is controversy on the efficacy
of the drug provided either as monotherapy or in combination with
β-lactams in critically ill patients with ventilator-associated
pneumonia (VAP). We compared prospectively the efficacy and
safety of administration of colistin alone and in combination with
β-lactams in patients with VAP and bacteremia caused by
multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria.
Patients and methods Twelve patients (mean age: 57 ± 17 years)
with VAP (quantitative cultures of tracheal aspirates of broncho-
alveolar lavage [BAL]) and bacteraemia (at least one positive blood
culture), caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33%), Acineto-
bacter baumanii (58%) and/or Klebsiella pneumonia (25%),
resistant to all antibiotics except colistin, were treated with intra-
venous colistin. Four of them (group A) received monotherapy with
colistin (3 × 106 IU three times daily, adjusted for creatinine
clearance) and eight of them received combination of colistin with
cefepime, or piperacilline-tazobactam (group B). Follow-up cultures
and clinical evaluation of all patients were performed 4 days after
the initiation of therapy. Clinical success was defined by a
lessening of the signs and symptoms of VAP, while microbiologic
success was defined as eradication of the pathogen in blood
culture.
Results Follow-up blood cultures revealed microbiologic success
in one patient from group A (25%) and four patients from group B
(50%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.4).
Eradication of the pathogen from tracheal aspirates or BAL was
confirmed in the same patients. Clinical success followed
microbiologic success in one patient from group A (25%) and five
patients from group B (62.5%), difference not statistically
significant (P = 0.3). One patient from group B developed acute
renal failure and was treated with continuous venovenous
hemofiltration (8%). No differences concerning mortality were
observed between the two groups (group A: 100%, group B:
62.5%, P = 0.5).
Conclusion Preliminary results demonstrate that combination
therapy (colistin plus β-lactam) acts more effectively than
monotherapy in VAP and bacteraemia from multiresistant Gram-
negative strains. Colistin therapy in both groups was safe.

Introduction The resistance of Gram-negative strains in the ICU is
a growing problem. Recent studies suggest in-vitro synergy of
colistin with β-lactams and colistin with rifampicin against these
strains. However, there is controversy on the efficacy of the drug
provided either as monotherapy or in combination with these drugs
in critically ill patients.
Aim To determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of
intravenous colistin as monotherapy or in combination with
β-lactams or rifampicin.
Methods Sixteen patients admitted to a medical ICU between
March 2005 and December 2005 who grew multiple-resistant
strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three patients), Acineto-
bacter baumanii (eight patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one
patient) or mixed organisms (four patients) were included in the
study. Fourteen patients had ventilator-associated pneumonia, one
abdominal sepsis and one catheter-related sepsis. These patients

were allocated to treatment: with colistin monotherapy in a dose of
3 million units three times daily adjusted for creatinine clearance
(group 1: six patients), with colistin in the same dose and
β-lactams (group 2: eight patients), and with the combination of
rifampicin (600 mg/day) with colistin (group 3: two patients).
Follow-up cultures and clinical evaluation were performed 5 days
after the initiation of treatment. Clinical success was defined as a
lessening of the signs and symptoms of infection, while
microbiologic success was defined as eradication of the pathogen
in follow-up qualitive cultures or as a 2-log decrease in bacterial
load in quantitive cultures (BAL). The outcome of patients
(discharged from the ITU or died) was also determined.
Results In group 1, three patients (50%) showed clinical improve-
ment and three did not improve (50%). In group 2, four patients
improved (50%) and four did not (50%). In group 3, one patient
improved (50%) and one deteriorated (50%). Microbiological
improvement occurred in two out of six (33.3%) in group 1, five out
of seven (71.4%) in group 2 and one out of two (50%) in group 3.
Favorable outcome (discharged to the ward) occurred in one
patient out of six (16.6%) in group 1, two out of seven (28.5%) in
group 2 and one out of two (50%) in group 3. There is no
statistically significant difference in clinical, microbiological or final
outcome between the groups (P > 0.05). Three patients (18.75%)
had significant side-effects (two renal impairment and one
thrombocytopenia).
Conclusions Patients that received the combination of colistin
with β-lactams and colistin with rifampicin had higher rates of
microbiological response and better outcome than patients in the
colistin monotherapy group. The difference is not statistically
significant, which is probably due to the small number of patients,
especially in the rifampicin group, and the study is continuing with
the recruitment of more patients.

Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated
with the greatest mortality among nosocomial infections. Death
rates associated with Pseudomonas spp. or with late-onset VAP
seem higher. Antibacterial therapy is often complicated by
resistance of nosocomial pathogens. This problem has been
increasing in recent years.
Objective The goal of the study was to assess susceptibility of
Pseudomonas spp. to meropenem and imipenem in patients with
VAP. In a 12-bed surgical ICU, at a 400-bed surgical complex of a
district hospital, we studied prospectively all patients with VAP,
clinical and bacteriological (quantitive endotracheal aspirate
culture, Protected Specimen Brush), diagnosed from January 2002
to January 2004. We looked for the demography, APACHE II
score, mortality, attributable VAP mortality, days on mechanical
ventilation, and length of stay in the ICU. One hundred and forty
strains of Pseudomonas spp. from patients with VAP were
isolated. In 102 isolated strains, the gel diffusion technique was
used to investigate susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem.
Results Susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem was
registered in 55/102 (53.9%), while 35/102 (34.3%) showed
susceptibility to meropenem and resistance to imipenem. Another
12/102 (11.8%) isolated strains were resistant to both
carbapenems. Eighty-five of 140 strains were Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Susceptibility to carbapenems was tested in 64
strains: 36/64 (56.25%) were susceptible to both antibiotics;
16/64 (25%) were sensitive to meropenem and resistant or
intermediary resistant to imipenem. Ten out of 85 (11.8%) were
resistant to both antibiotics. Fifty-five out of 140 (39.3%) were
Pseudomonas species, and in 37 susceptibility to meropenem and
imipenem was investigated: 16/37 (43.24%) were sensitive to
both antibiotics; 16/37 (43.24%) were susceptible to meropenem
and resistant to imipenem; 5/37 (13.5%) isolated strains showed
resistance to both investigated antibiotics.
Conclusion Strains of Pseudomonas isolated from patients with
VAP demonstrate a high level of resistance to imipenem. In the
investigation period, Pseudomonas strains resistant to meropenem
were isolated for the first time. Considering that carbapenems are
drugs of choice for the treatment patients with VAP due to
multiresistant strains, appearance of high resistance points to the
necessity of their rational use.

Introduction Linezolid is a new antimicrobial agent effective
against drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens commonly
responsible for central nervous system (CNS) infections in
neurosurgical patients hospitalized in ICUs.
Materials and methods We studied the penetration of linezolid
into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 14 neurosurgical patients.
Drug disposition in serum and CSF was studied by administering
linezolid 600 mg twice daily (1 hour i.v. infusion) for the treatment
of Gram-positive CNS infections or as chemoprohylaxis. Serum
and CSF linezolid steady-state concentrations were analyzed by
HPLC and the concentration–time profiles obtained were analyzed
to estimate pharmacokinetic parameters.
Results Mean ± SD linezolid peak and trough concentrations were
19.7 ± 9.9 µg/ml and 5.8 ± 5.2 µg/ml in serum and 9.8 ± 5.6 µg/ml
and 5.8 ± 4.2 µg/ml in CSF, respectively. The mean ± SD areas
under the concentration–time curves during the 12-hour dosing
interval (AUC0-Ts) were 195.6 ± 159.6 hour*µg/ml for serum and
88 ± 55 hour*µg/ml for CSF, with a mean penetration ratio
AUC0-T CSF:AUC0-T serum of 0.50. The mean elimination half-life
of linezolid in CSF was longer than that in serum (18.3 ± 19.2
compared with 5.9 ± 3.3 hours). Serum and CSF linezolid
concentrations exceeded the breakpoint of 4 µg/ml for susceptible
target pathogens for the entire dosing interval in the majority of
patients. Two patients with documented Staphylococcus aureus
CNS infection and one with primary MRSE bacteremia were
successfully treated.
Conclusions These findings suggest that linezolid may achieve
adequate CSF concentrations in patients requiring antibiotics for
the management/prophylaxis of Gram-positive CNS infections.
More studies are needed regarding clinical efficacy of linezolid
regarding the management of CNS infections.

Introduction Acinetobacter baumanii (AB) has been increasingly
reported in outbreaks affecting patients from ICUs and other
hospital departments. The prevention of the spread of the infection
needs exceptional measures in order to prevent transmission to
other inpatients through health care workers (HCW). In this study
we describe the effectiveness of an extensive infection control
program introduced after the onset of an AB outbreak in an ICU.
Methods The AB outbreak occurred from January 2004 to April
2004 in an eight-bed ICU in a university-affiliated 1800-bed
hospital. An infection control policy was instituted to contain the
outspread of the infection from mid January (Table 1). In order to
analyse the effectiveness of this intervention we have evaluated
three periods: the period of AB outbreak (period AB from 1 January
to 31 March 2004), the period after AB outbreak (period post-AB
from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005) and the period before the
AB outbreak (period pre-AB from 1 January to 31 December
2003). Statistical analysis was performed with Student’s t test, the
Mann–Whitney U test and the chi-square test.

Results A total of 855 patients (pre-AB 400, AB 101, post-AB
354) were involved in this study. ICU LOS was higher in period AB
(9.99 days in comparison with 7.27 and 7.37 days in period pre-
AB and post-AB, respectively) and the mean SAPS II was
statistically higher in period AB (43.4) and post-AB (39.2) rather
than pre-AB (33.9). The AB outbreak was contained and the
pathogen was successfully eradicated from ICU in the remaining
time period. No difference in mortality was reported.
Conclusions The full knowledge of an infection control policy, and
its aggressive application, has successfully contained the AB
outbreak in a short period of time. It has also prevented the re-
occurrence of the pathogen that was completely eradicated from
the ICU environment in the following year. The main features of this
policy are surveillance cultures, microbiologist consultation and up-
to-date antibiotic prescription schemes.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P106 (doi:10.1186/cc4453)
Objectives To examine the percentage of microbiologically proven
infections (MPI) among patients with severe sepsis/septic shock
with clinically suspected infection (CSI) in a large and represen-
tative sample of German ICUs.
Background In a European ICU survey, 55% of community-
acquired and 71% of nosocomial infections were reported to be
microbiologically proven [1].
Design and setting A prospective observational cross-sectional
1-day-prevalence study from 15 January 2003 to 14 January 2004.
A representative random sample of 310 hospitals with 454 ICUs
out of a total of 1380 German hospitals with 2075 ICUs was
obtained, forming five strata according to hospital size: strata 1–4
comprised all nonuniversity hospitals with <200, 201–400,
401–600, and >600 beds, respectively, and stratum 5 comprised
all university hospitals. Visits by experienced ICU physicians from
SepNet’s 17 regional study centers were randomly selected over a
1-year period to allow for seasonal variations.
Patients A total of 3877 patients were screened according to the
ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference criteria. Patients with CSI
needed to have evidence of an infection such as white blood cells
in a normally sterile body fluid, perforated viscus, chest X-ray
consistent with pneumonia and associated with purulent tracheal
production, or a clinical syndrome associated with a high
probability of infection (e.g. ascending cholangitis).
Results In total 1348 patients (34.7%) were infected, 736
(54.6%) of whom had CSI and 612 (45.4%) MPI. MPI was more
frequent in larger hospitals, CSI more frequent in smaller hospitals
(P < 0.0001). Among infected patients, the rate of MPI was
highest in university hospitals (59.0%) and lowest in hospitals with
< 200 beds (33.5%), reflecting the availability of microbiological
laboratories (laboratory present in 16.3% in hospitals with 400
beds and in 70.0% in hospitals with 600 beds). Among the 1348
patients with infections, 415 (30.8%) had severe sepsis or septic
shock. Patients with severe sepis/septic shock more often had MPI
than patients without (57.3% vs 40.1%, P < 0.0001).
Conclusions This epidemiological study shows a low overall rate
of MPI in German ICUs. This is partly due to the lack of
microbiological laboratories in small and middle-sized hospitals. It
underlines the need for better culture-independent laboratory
methods with a faster turnaround.

Objective To evaluate the efficiency of antibacterial protocol in
severe trauma patients on the incidence and mortality of VAP.
Methods This study was approved by the local ethics committee.
A comparable analysis of incidence, attributive mortality (chi-
square test) and pathogens of VAP in severe trauma patients was
performed during two periods: 2001 (before introduction of
protocol) and 2004 (after introduction of protocol) years. The
developed protocol included:
1. Abandoning of antibiotic prophylaxis of VAP.
2. Intrusion criteria of early diagnostics of VAP.
3. Exclusion of all cefalosporine I–III generation, aminoglycosides
and fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy of VAP.
4. Cefepime or cefoperazone/sulbactam (APACHE II score
< 20) and carbapenems (APACHE II score > 20) were used
as empiric therapy of VAP.
5. Efficacy of antibiotic treatment was evaluated after 48 hours.
6. Carbapenems and/or vancomycin was added if empiric
therapy was inefficient. In the case of suspected diagnosis of
VAP, microbiological analysis of broncoalveolar lavage fluid
(BAL) was performed.
Results In this study were included 499 patients with severe
trauma and respiratory support for longer than 48 hours (2001,
220 patients and 2004, 279 patients). There was no difference in
ISS and APACHE II score between the groups. The incidence of
VAP was 10% in 2001 (22/220) and 9% in 2003 (25/279),
difference not significant. The attributive mortality due to VAP in
2001 was 63% (14/22) and in 2004 was 24% (6/25) (P < 0.01).
A widespread using of broad-spectrum antibiotics shifted the
structure of nosocomial pathogens. We observed a decrease in
the rate of MRSA and a significant increase in the rate of Klebsiella
pneumoniae (from 0.6 to 18.1%, most strains were resistant to
cefalosporine III) and Acinetobacter baumanii (from 1.2 to 12.3%,
most strains were resistant to ceftazidime).
Conclusions Intrusion of antibacterial protocol in patients with
multiple trauma and VAP results in a decrease of attributive
mortality (P < 0.01) without a change in incidence of VAP.

The increasing consumption of antibiotics in hospitals and the
economic implications of this increase led us to survey this
consumption in the various hospital units. Our study proposes to
measure the annual antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance in an
intensive care burn department in order to direct the control measures.
During a 5-year period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004
we studied the consumption of the following antibiotics: oxacillin,
imipenem, ceftazidime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, vacomycin. We
measured antibiotic consumption with the antimicrobial density
(AD), which takes into account the quantity of antibiotics in grams
converted to the defined daily dose (DDD) and the number of days
of hospitalization. The DDD was proposed by the World Health
Organisation. The calculation of the AD for each molecule was
carried out according to the following formula: AD = (quantity
consumed [g] for the particular antimicrobial × 1000) / (DDD for
that antimicrobial × number of days hospitalized).
The study of the total consumption of antibiotics showed a peak in
2002. The distribution by families of antibiotics shows variations
according to various molecules. Among oxacillin, a significant
decrease in the consumption of this molecule was observed in
2004 (AD = 44 in 2004 vs AD = 128.2 in 2002). At the same
time, a significant increase in the consumption of vancomycin (AD =
28.15 in 2002 vs 73.9 into 2004) was also observed. This
intensive use of vancomycin was explained by the high incidence
of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in our burn
department (MRSA = 64% in 2004). As elsewhere, no vancomycin
intermediate S. aureus was detected during the period of study, in
spite of the significant use of this antibiotic. There were statistically
significant relationships between increasing use of ceftazidime and
ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (rs = 0.93, P = 0.02).
Concerning the fluoroquinolones, there were statistically significant
relationships between increasing use of ciprofloxacin and
incidence of resistant P. aeruginosa to this antibiotic (rs = 0.89,
P = 0.043). In addition to the resistance to the drug itself, the
consumption of ciprofloxacin was significantly associated with
resistance to the imipeneme in P. aeruginosa (rs = 0.87 P = 0.05).
A restriction of the use of ciprofloxacin was taken during 2003 and
2004; this was followed by a significant decrease of resistance in
P. aeruginosa. The use of fluoroquinolones was not significantly
associated with MRSA (rs = 0.70, P = 0.1).
The monitoring of both antibiotic consumption and antibiotic
resistance makes it possible to set up targeted policies and to
control their effectiveness. Nevertheless this monitoring must be
integrated into a policy of good use and control of antibiotic use.

Increasing resistance in P. aeruginosa to multiple antibiotics has
been observed and is posing therapeutic dilemmas. Antibiotic
utilization is one factor that has been associated with the
emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
We examined the relationships between annual antibiotic use and
the incidence of resistance of P. aeruginosa isolates within the
burned patients admitted to our intensive care department in order
to direct measurements of control.
During a 5-year period (1 January 2000–31 December 2004), 203
nonrepetitive strains of P. aeruginosa were isolated from different
specimens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been carried
out by the disk diffusion method according to the French Society
of Microbiology. We studied the consumption of the following
antibiotics: imipenem, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin. We
measured antibiotic consumption with the antimicrobial density
(AD), which takes into account the quantity of antibiotics in grams

converted to daily doses dispensed and the number of patient-
days in hospital. The defined daily dose was defined according to
the World Health Organisation. Statistical analysis was conducted
to explore the relationships between antibiotic use and the
susceptibility patterns of P. aeruginosa. SPSS software was used
to calculate the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Statistical
significance was defined as P < 0.05 for the corresponding
correlation coefficients.
The consumption of ceftazidime showed no association with
resistance to this drug. There were statistically significant
relationships between increasing use of ciprofloxacin and
incidence of resistant P. aeruginosa to this antibiotic (rs = 0.89,
P = 0.05). In addition to the association between ciprofloxacin use
and resistance to the drug itself, our study revealed a significant
correlation between ciprofloxacin consumption and resistance to
imipeneme (rs = 0.89, P = 0.043). A restriction of the use of
ciprofloxacin was taken during 2003 and 2004; this was followed
by a significant decrease of incidence of resistance in
P. aeruginosa. The consumption of amikacin had no apparent
association with resistance in P. aeruginosa to this drug.
Our data support a major role for ciprofloxacin in the emergence of
multiresistance in P. aeruginosa. The use and/or duration of
treatment with this antibiotic should be restricted as part of efforts
to control the emergence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa.

Background Extensive use of antibiotics is responsible for the
emergence of multiresistant strains, in the clinical setting. In our
institution a profound remodelling of antibiotic prescription policy
and implemented procedures to control cross-patient transmission
were introduced in the first quarter of 2004, in response to an
outbreak of Acinetobacter baumanii (AB). In this study we reported
the effects induced by this new infection control program on the
frequency of isolation of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and its
antibiotic resistance profile.
Methods From January 2004 to April 2004 a new infection control
program was instituted to contain an outbreak of AB. The key
features of this approach consisted of the introduction of surveil-
lance cultures, in an extensive use of microbiological sampling to
guide therapy, a restricted antibiotic prescription policy (limited
prophylaxis, selection of drugs on the basis of microbiological
assays, early discontinuation of antimicrobials at clinical resolution,
de-escalation therapy, restricted formulary), and VAP containing
measures/devices (extended use of individual protection garments,
controlled hand-washing procedures). The infection control
program has remained operative after the resolution of the outbreak.
The impact of the program on the frequency and sensibility of SA
was evaluated for a 12-month period (period A from May 2004 to
April 2005). The 12 months preceding the introduction of the
program were considered a historical control period (period B from
January 2003 to December 2003). The incidence of methicillin-
sensitive SA (MSSA) and of methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA), the
consumption of vancomycin and oxacillin, demographic data of
admitted patients and outcome measures (ICU LOS and ICU
mortality) were evaluated in the two periods. Statistical analysis:
Student’s t test, Mann–Whitney U test and chi-squared test.
Results In period A more trauma patients and less surgical
patients were admitted to the ICU. The SAPS II was significantly
higher in period A. No difference in outcome measures was
reported. In period A, a significant increase of MSSA (P = 0.009)
and a significant decrease of MRSA (P = 0.03) were reported.
Due to this epidemiological modification the consumption of
oxacillin has noticeably increased, in association with a significant
reduction of vancomycin consumption (P = 0.04).
Conclusions The integrated infection control program introduced for
the containment of an AB outbreak has resulted in profoundly
affecting the microbiological environment of the ICU. In particular, it
has significantly reduced the occurrence of MRSA. The increase in
methicillin sensitivity of SA improved the use of oxacillin in place of
vancomycin, with potentially favourable effects on costs. The finding
that a different prevalence of trauma and surgical patients has
occurred in the two study periods is a potentially confounding
variable. Nevertheless, the higher severity of patients admitted in
period A not being associated with an increase in mortality and LOS
seems to confirm the positive effects of the renewal introduced.

Introduction Sepsis represents the major cause of death in the
ICUs all over the world and is a major challenge in these units. Many
studies had been shown an increasing incidence over time and only
a slight reduction in mortality. Many new treatment strategies are
arising and we should know our incidence of sepsis and features.
Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in 65
hospitals of all regions of Brazil. The patients who were admitted or
who developed sepsis during the month of September 2003 were
enrolled. They were followed until the 28th day or less according to
their discharge. The diagnoses were made in accordance with the
criteria proposed by ACCP/SCCM. The final classification was
made considering the worse stage in the first 4 days after the
diagnosis of sepsis. Parameters evaluated were demographic
features, APACHE II score, SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure
Assessment) score, mortality, sources of infections, microbiology
and interventions. Also recorded was underlying diseases and
length of stay (LOS).
Results A total of 3128 patients were identified and 526 (17%)
filled the criteria of sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. Two
hundred and sixty-six (50.6%) patients had septic shock, 157
(30%) severe sepsis, and 102 (19.4%) had sepsis. The average
age was 61.7 years (SD ±18.9), 293 (55%) were males, and the
overall 28-day mortality rate was 46.2%. The average APACHE II
score was 20(SD ±7.8) and the SOFA score on the first day was
7 (SD ±3.8). The SOFA score on the mortality group was higher
on day 1 (8), and had increased on day 3. The mortality rate for
sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock was 15.7%, 33.8% and
65%, respectively. The average LOS was 16 days. The two main
sources of infection were the respiratory tract (50.2%) and the

abdomen (16.3%). Gram-negative bacilli were more prevalent
(55.6%). Gram-positive cocci accounted for 32% and fungi
infections for 5%. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the
most frequent underlying disease seen.
Conclusion A high incidence and mortality of sepsis was observed
in ICUs in our country. The high frequency of septic shock and
severe sepsis demonstrated a group at high risk of death.

Management of sepsis and septic shock in critically ill
patients transferred by a dedicated transport team in the
West of Scotland

Over 500 critically ill patients are transferred by the dedicated
transport team known as the ‘Shock Team’ each year in the West
of Scotland. With the advent of international guidelines for the
management of severe sepsis and septic shock, there are now
criteria by which the management of these conditions can be
assessed [1]. We undertook a prospective audit over a 3-month
period to determine what proportion of the patients transferred
have these conditions and to determine how management
conforms to the guidelines.
Patients were deemed to have sepsis if they had suspicion of
infection and two or more of the following: T >38°C or < 36°C;
WCC < 4 or >12 × 103/mm3; HR >90/min; RR >20/min;
SBP <90 mmHg or MAP <65 mmHg or needing a vasopressor.
We adapted sepsis resuscitation bundles derived from the
guidelines [2] and devised a data collection form with relation to
the following: serum lactate measurement; blood cultures prior to
antibiotics; antibiotics given within 3 hours; MAP <65 mmHg and
management with a minimum 20 ml/kg fluid challenge, vaso-
pressors, and CVP monitoring; achievement of MAP ≥65 mmHg;
measurement of central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). Data
were collected for every patient transferred during June, July, and
August 2005.
Data were collected for 82 patients. Forty-five patients (55%, 95%
CI 44–66%) met criteria for sepsis. Of these, eight patients had
blood cultures prior to antibiotics (18%, 95% CI 8–32%), and in
23 (51%, 95% CI 35–66%) this information was not available or
unclear. Similarly, 24 patients (53%, 95% CI 28–68%) had
antibiotics within the time window, and in 17 (38%, 95% CI
24–54%) this was unclear. Twenty-eight (62%, 95% CI 47–76%)
patients had circulatory failure with 19 of these (68%, 95% CI
48–84%) requiring more than a fluid challenge alone. MAP
≥65 mmHg was achieved in 43 patients (96%, 95% CI
85–100%). Two patients with sepsis had serum lactate measured
(4%, 95% CI 0.5–15%). One patient of the 19 who had not
responded to a fluid challenge had ScvO2 measurement (5%, 95%
CI 0–26%).
A significant number of critically ill patients with sepsis and septic
shock are transferred each year. Many have circulatory failure and
this is managed consistently with fluids, vasopressor and CVP
targeting. Documentation and communication of blood culture
withdrawal and antibiotic therapy may be poor. Serum lactate and
ScvO2 measurement may not yet be part of routine management of
patients with sepsis transported in the West of Scotland.

Introduction Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) affect around
9% of all patients in hospital [1]. It is generally accepted that the
infection rate in the ICU is higher than elsewhere in the hospital
and these patients are subject to many invasive procedures that
increase their risk of acquiring an HAI. Our aim was to conduct a
prospective pilot audit of HAI in ICUs in Scotland using the
Hospitals in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance
(HELICS) protocol for surveillance of nosocomial infections in
ICUs using the current Scottish audit database (Ward Watcher
software; Critical Care Audit Ltd, Yorkshire, UK).
Methods Between 1 May 2005 and 31 August 2005, five of the
25 adult, general ICUs in Scotland participated for 3 months each
in a prospective pilot audit of HAI in ICUs. Daily data were
recorded on enabling identification of the first episode of infection:
HELICS Level 2 surveillance of blood stream infections (BSI),
catheter-related infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia
surveillance.
Results In this 3-month pilot study a total of 386 patients were
admitted to the five pilot sites, 52% (199) of whom stayed in the
ICU for at least 2 days. For these five ICUs the average occupancy
was 78.3%, the first 24-hour APACHE II score 19.8 and the
average length of ICU stay 5.7 days. In 32 patients (16%) there
were 44 episodes of infection diagnosed using the criteria: BSI =
11.4%, PN = 68.2% and CVC = 20.5%. The overall infection rate
was 30.5 infections (95% CI 22.2–40.9) per 1000 patient-days.
Twenty-three (72%) patients developed one episode of infection,
five (16%) had two episodes, three (9%) developed three
episodes and one (3%) patient had four episodes. The majority of
pneumonias (60%) were PN4 because quantitative microbiological
analysis (PN1 and PN2) is not available routinely.
Conclusion Of all patients admitted to ICU during the pilot study
16% developed an ICU-associated infection. As expected, the
majority of infections diagnosed were pneumonias (68%). This is
consistent with the findings of the European Prevalence of
Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC) study [2].

and these patients are subject to many invasive procedures that
increase their risk of acquiring an HAI. Our aim was to study the
feasibility of utilising the current Scottish audit database (Ward
Watcher; Critical Care Audit Ltd, Yorkshire, UK) to collect
surveillance data electronically, and the application of the Hospitals
in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance (HELICS)
definitions for ICU-associated infection in Scotland.
Methods Between 1 May 2005 and 31 August 2005, five of the
25 adult, general ICUs in Scotland participated for 3 months each
in a prospective pilot audit of HAI in ICUs. Daily data were
recorded on software modified to enable identification of the first
episode of infection: HELICS Level 2 surveillance of blood stream
infections (BSI), catheter-related infections and ventilator-
associated pneumonia surveillance.
Results The results of the pilot audit indicate that surveillance of
infections acquired in ICUs in Scotland using Ward Watcher for
data collection and the HELICS definitions for infection is a feasible
process. The HELICS definitions for ICU-associated infection are
applicable in Scotland; definitions for pneumonia, bloodstream
infections and CVC-related blood stream infections could be
applied in all hospitals. Feedback for Ward Watcher as a tool to
collect data for surveillance purposes was positive; all participants
found that the system was easy to use. The major criticism of the
system was that data from patients admitted for less than 2 days
were required as some of these data would not be analysed. The
initial decision to include these patients was taken as an attempt to
simplify data collection. It is probable that further development of
Ward Watcher could facilitate the requirement to collect data only
for those patients who have a stay of more than 2 days.
Conclusion The pilot was successful. Surveillance activity
throughout Scotland would be dependent on several factors
including some refinements to Ward Watcher to improve the
efficiency, accuracy and ease of data collection.

Evaluation of the viability of a hemodynamic optimization
protocol to high-risk surgical patients using less invasive
monitoring tools

Introduction Clinical, hemodynamics and perfusion variables are
important tools to identify instable patients and guide therapy.
There is a strong suggestion that shock-induced organ failure is
attributable to peripheral tissue hypoperfusion and/or cellular
hypoxia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a
hemodynamic optimization protocol to correct tissue hypoxia
during the initial postoperative period.
Patients and methods Fifteen high-risk surgical patients
according to Shoemaker’s criteria were prospectively included
when hyperlactatemia (arterial lactate ≥3 mmol/l) was present at
ICU admission. Patients were monitored with Vigileo™ (Edwards
Lifescience, Irvine, CA, USA) and resuscitated during the first 12
postoperative hours using the protocol shown in Fig. 1. The
patients were considered as responders if at the end of
resuscitation SvcO2 ≥70% and arterial lactate ≤2 mmol/l.
Results The mean age was 66 ± 13 years and 66% were male.
The median APACHE II and MODS scores were 20.1 ± 6.4 and
5.6 ± 3.1, respectively. The main surgical procedure performed
was resection of abdominal neoplasia (10/15). The mean amount
of colloids administered during resuscitation period was
1715 ± 760 ml. Five out of 15 and 4/15 patients have used
dobutamine and norepinephrine, respectively. Only two patients
were transfused. Twelve patients were considered responders with
8.3% of the hospital mortality rate. Two of three nonresponders
patients died before hospital discharge.
Conclusion This hemodynamic optimization protocol based in less
invasive technologies was efficient to correct tissue hypoxia in this
sample of patients. These results warrant validation in a control trial.

Antimicrobial treatment in patients with severe sepsis and
septic shock: results from the German Prevalence Study

Competence Network Sepsis
Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P116 (doi:10.1186/cc4463)
Objective To determine the usage of antibiotic therapy for severe
sepsis and septic shock in German ICUs.
Background Appropriate antimicrobial therapy is one of the
cornerstones in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics, as ureidopenicillins, fourth-class
cephalosporins, carbapenems or fluorchinolons, are recommended
agents for empirical antibiotic therapy. To date, nothing is known
about how patients with severe sepsis and septic shock are
actually treated in Germany.
Design and setting A prospective observational cross-sectional
1-day-prevalence study from 15 January 2003 to 14 January 2004.
A representative random sample of 310 hospitals with 454 ICUs
out of a total of 1380 German hospitals with 2075 ICUs was
obtained, forming five strata according to hospital size. Hospitals
were visited by experienced ICU physicians from SepNet’s 17
regional study centers.
Patients From 3877 patients screened, 415 (11%) patients —

in German ICUs — fulfilled the ACCP/SCCM criteria for severe
sepsis or septic shock and were included in the analysis.
Results The predominating origin of infection was respiratory tract
infections (64%), followed by intra-abdominal infections (25.7%).
Microbiological documentation was found in 57.3% of patients,
57.6% of whom had Gram-positive, 55.5% Gram-negative and
25.6% fungal infections; 9.6% of positive cultures were blood
cultures. Less than 2% of patients had MRSA infections. Seven
hundred and fifty-seven different antimicrobial agents were
administered alone or in combination in the 415 patients with
severe sepsis/septic shock on the study day: ureidopenicillins
(12.0%), cephalosporins (12.6%), fluorchinolones (11.8%), carba-
penems (10.4%), aminoglycosides (8.1%), glycopeptides (7.9%),
metronidazole (8.2%), macrolides (4.5%), and antimycotics (9.8%).
Of the antimicrobial prescriptions, 64.9% were administered
empirically and 31.8% were microbiologically guided. Seventy-one
(17.1.0%) patients received antimycotic treatment, but in only
11.6% were fungal isolates considered the likely cause of sepsis.
Conclusions The usage of broad-spectrum antibiotics among
patients with severe sepsis/septic shock is high in German ICUs,
indicating that most patients probably receive appropriate
antibiotic therapy. Aminoglycosides, which according to a recent
meta-analysis [1] have been shown not to have additional benefit
as an adjunct to broad spectrum-antibiotics, but rather renal side
effects, have a rather low prescription rate. There may be an
overuse of antimycotics, underlining the need for better diagnostic
tools in patients colonized by fungi.

Prevalence of infection in German ICUs: results from the
German Prevalence Study

Competence Network Sepsis
Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P117 (doi:10.1186/cc4464)
Objective To compare prior findings from the German subgroup of
the EPIC study with recent data from the German Prevalence study.
Background In a European 1-day-prevalence study in 1992
(EPIC), 10,038 patients in 1417 ICUs throughout Europe with
2010 patients on 268 ICUs in Germany were studied [1]. The
overall infection rate was 44.8%; community-acquired infections
(CAI) were present in 13.7%, hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in
9.7%, and ICU-acquired infections (IAI) in 20.6%. A strong
correlation between IAI and mortality was found, but rates of IAI
varied between countries.
Design and setting A prospective observational cross-sectional 1-
day-prevalence study from 15 January 2003 to 14 January 2004. A
representative random sample of 310 hospitals with 454 ICUs out
of a total of 1380 German hospitals with 2075 ICUs was obtained,
forming five strata according to hospital size. Hospitals were visited
by experienced ICU physicians from SepNet’s 17 regional study
centers. Visits were randomly selected over a 1-year period to allow
for seasonal variations. A total of 3877 patients were screened
according to the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference criteria.
Patients In total 1348 patients (34.7%) were infected, comparable
with the prevalence of infection in German ICUs in the EPIC study
(36.6%). Prevalence of CAI was 13.6% (EPIC: 11.2%), HAI 4.8%
(EPIC: 8.1%) and IAI 11.4% (EPIC: 17.3%). In our study, among
the 1348 patients with infections, 415 (30.8%) had severe sepsis
(sevSep) or septic shock (SS). The prevalence of CAI in patients
with sevSep/SS was 35.4%, HAI 19.8% and IAI 36.6%,
respectively. Comparing infected patients with and without
sevSep/SS, HAI and IAI were more frequent than CAI in patients
with sevSep/SS (P = 0.0002). However, there was no difference
in ICU mortality between sevSep/SS patients with CAI (51%), HAI
(60%) and IAI (54%), respectively. In the EPIC study, the mortality
of patients in German ICUs was 14.9%. However, the prevalence
of sevSep/SS was not assessed.
Conclusions Our findings show a lower prevalence of IAI, a higher
prevalence of HAI/CAI and a substantially higher mortality rate,
independent of the origin of infection, as compared with data from
the German subgroup in the EPIC study. This difference may be due
to different hospital sizes, as university hospitals were more frequent
in the EPIC sample (35%) and ICUs participated by invitation, in
contrast to our representative sample with random selection of ICUs.
In order to reduce preventable infections, implementation of infection
control policies should not be restricted to patients with IAI, but
should include patients with CAI and HAI as well.

Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P118 (doi:10.1186/cc4465)
Objective To evaluate the risk factors for the incidence and the
outcome of patients with bloodstream infections (BSIs) in a multi-
disciplinary ICU.
Methods During a 1-year period (August 2004–July 2005), all ICU
patients with more than 48 hours ICU stay were studied. All
episodes of BSIs were recorded with the exception of those due to
coagulase-negative staphylococci because of difficulties in the
clinical interpretation. The prognostic value of clinical and
laboratory variables were determined.
Results Of the 693 patients admitted to the ICU during the study
period, 572 patients had a stay longer than 48 hours. Among them
a total of 125 patients developed one or more episodes of BSI.
There was a significant difference between patients with and
without BSIs in the length of ICU stay (6 vs 26 days, median,
respectively), and in days of mechanical ventilation (7 vs 26 days,
median, respectively). The median time between ICU admission
and the first BSI was 10 days. The most common isolated
pathogen was Acinetobacter baumannii (32.5%), followed by
Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(13.8%), Enterobacter aerogenes (6.9%), Staphylococcus aureus
(5.8%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%). The APACHE II score
on admission was significantly higher in patients with BSI (19 ±
6.3 vs 16 ± 7, P < 0.001). The best independent prognostic
factors of the development of BSI were APACHE II score on
admission (OR, 1.05; 95% CI 1.02–1.086, P < 0.001), the
presence of ARDS (OR, 2.63; 95% CI 1.42–4.87, P = 0.002) and
a history of diabetes (OR, 2.26; 95% CI 1.3–3.93, P = 0.004).
The ICU mortality rate was 46.4% and 22% for patients with and
without BSIs, respectively (P < 0.001). Independent predictors of
mortality were admission APACHE II score (OR, 1.13; 95% CI
1.1–1.2, P < 0.001), and the presence of BSI (OR, 2.5; 95% CI
1.6–3.9, P < 0.001).

Conclusion In our ICU patients the illness severity on admission,
the history of diabetes and the presence of ARDS are risk factors
for the incidence of BSI. The severity of illness and the presence of
BSI are factors independently associated with the outcome.

Hospital Universitario de Canarias, La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P119 (doi:10.1186/cc4466)
Objective To determine the incidence of nosocomial infection in
critically ill patients with brain trauma.
Methods A prospective study was performed during 12 months of
patients with brain trauma admitted to a 24-bed medical–surgical
ICU of a 650-bed university hospital. Infections were diagnosed
according to CDC criteria. Infections were classified based on the
onset moment as early onset and late onset: early onset (EO) were
those developed during the first 4 days of the ICU stay; and late
onset (LO) were those developed 5 days after ICU admission. The
statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 11.0 program.
Continuous variables are reported as means and standard
deviation, and categoric variables as percentages.
Results We included 67 patients, 57 males. The mean age was
38.02 ± 17.49 years. The mean APACHE II score was 18.32 ±
12.21. A total of 27 patients (40.29%) developed 38 nosocomial
infections (18 EO and 20 LO): 27 pneumonias (15 EO and 12 LO;
seven MSSA, one MRSA, six Pseudomonas aeruginosa, four
Hemophillus influenzae), six urinary tract infections (one EO and
five LO; three CNS), two primary bacteremias (one EO and one
LO; one CNS and one Acinetobacter), one catheter-related
bacteremia (one LO; one Enterobacter), one ventriculitis (one EO;
one CNS) and one wound surgical infection (one LO; one Pseudo-
monas aeruginosa). The microorganisms responsible for noso-
comial infections were the following: eight MSSA, one MRSA,
seven P. aeruginosa, five CNS, five H. influenzae and 12 others.
Death occurred in 14 patients (20.89%).
Conclusions In our series, 40% of patients developed some
infection. Two-thirds of nosocomial infections had a respiratory
origin. The most frequent microorganisms were MSSA and P.
aeruginosa. One-quarter of patients died.

Representative survey of criteria used for the diagnosis of
severe sepsis/septic shock among German ICU
physicians: results from the German Prevalence Study

Competence Network Sepsis
Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P120 (doi:10.1186/cc4467)
Objective To assess the use of sepsis criteria in daily clinical
practice in German ICUs.
Background Different definitions for sepsis are used by clinicians,
epidemiologists and microbiologists. In 1992, a set of definitions
was agreed upon by an ACCP/SCCM panel of experts. However,
a recent poll of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and
the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) showed
that 87% of the responding intensivists doubt the validity of these
criteria for sepsis at the bedside.
Design and setting A prospective observational cross-sectional 1-
day-prevalence study from 15 January 2003 to 14 January 2004. A
representative random sample of 310 hospitals with 454 ICUs out
of a total of 1380 German hospitals with 2075 ICUs was obtained,
forming five strata according to hospital size: strata 1–4 comprised
all non-university hospitals with <200, 201–400, 401–600, and
>600 beds, respectively, and stratum 5 comprised all university
hospitals. Visits by experienced ICU physicians from SepNet’s 17
regional study centers were randomly distributed over a 1-year
period to allow for seasonal variations. ICU directors were asked
whether they used the sepsis criteria or not and marked either
‘always’, ‘frequently’, ‘sometimes’, ‘rarely’ or ‘never’ for their use of
sepsis markers.
Results Essential for diagnosis were: clinical criteria according to
individual experience (96.5%), positive blood culture (81.5%),
ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference Criteria (56.6%). In total
37.9% stated never using Gram-stains of respiratory specimens,
and in 13.2% of these ICUs the laboratory turn around for first
blood culture results was >24 hours. Of ICU directors, 90.5%
stated using laboratory markers for sepsis diagnosis. The absolute
leucocyte count was used in 92.7% (‘always’); the differential
leucocyte count, however, was used only in 47.8% (‘always’). C-
reactive protein was the most preferred biochemical marker
(‘always’: 90.1%), compared with procalcitonin (‘always’: 13.9,
‘frequently’: 9.5, ‘sometimes’: 15.2%), IL-6 (3.7, 4.2, 5.9%) and
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein levels (2.4, 2.0, 3.7%).
Conclusions The acceptance of the ACCP/SCCM criteria is low
in Germany, similar to results from US and European surveys. For
the diagnosis of sepsis, ICU physicians seem to rely more on their
personal experience rather than on expert recommendations of
standardized criteria. Procalcitonin levels are used by one-third of
ICU physicians in addition to conventional laboratory markers and
clinical signs of sepsis.

Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P121 (doi:10.1186/cc4468)
Aim To analyse the pattern of microbial isolates and antibiotic
sensitivity with time, changing antibiotic prescription and improved
infection control.
Methods A 550-bed tertiary referral cancer center with 11 ICU
and 10 HDU beds. In 2004–05, the ICU had 640 admissions, with
a mean APACHE II score of 15. Prospectively collected microbial
culture and sensitivity data sent from the ICU over 34 months
(between September 2002 and June 2005) was retrospectively
analysed with respect to microbial isolates and antibiotic
sensitivity. Data between September 2002 and December 2003
(P1) was compared with that from January 2004 and June 2005
(P2). Between the two periods, empirical use of third-generation
cephalosporins was curtailed, with an increase in use of
piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems, and emphasis was laid
on handwashing and other infection control measures.
Results In P1, 622 (43.1%) of 1443 culture samples in 330
patients were positive and grew 750 organisms. In P2, 1807
culture samples were sent in 445 patients, of which 577 (32%)
were positive and grew 664 organisms. There were fewer
polymicrobial isolates in P2 (12% vs 16%, P = 0.01). There was
no difference in the number of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB)
(77% vs 80%), but there were fewer Gram-positive bacteria (GPB)
(14% vs 19%, P = 0.01) and more fungi (5.7% vs 3.5%,

S52
P = 0.04). The major GNB grown were similar between the two
periods with the largest being Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)
followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Escherichia coli (EC).
There was a reduction in the proportion of MRSA in P2 (12% vs
8%, P = 0.01) and a trend towards an increase in Acinetobacter
(12% vs 9%) and candida spp. (5.4% vs 3.4%, both P > 0.05).
There was a significant decrease in MRSA from thoracic isolates in
P2 (36% vs 3% P = 0.0004). In P2, resistance of PA to cipro-
floxacin reduced from 61% to 37%, and to ceftazidime from 81%
to 65% (P < 0.001 for both). However, resistance to imipenem
and meropenem increased from 49% to 61%, and from 32% to
56%, respectively (P < 0.01). Seventy-one percent of KP and 68%
of the EC strains were resistant to ceftazidime in P2 (vs 53%
[P = 0.030] and 60% [P > 0.05], respectively, in P1), probably
reflecting an increase in ESBLs. Sixteen percent of KP and 14%
EC strains were resistant to meropenem, versus 6.3% (P = 0.003)
and 6% (P > 0.05), respectively, in P1. VRE (four cases) was
observed in the ICU for the first time ever in P2. Overall, most GNB
in P2 were sensitive to ciprofloxacin (65%), followed by the
carbapenems (62%) and piperacillin-tazobactam (50%).
Conclusion There is high incidence of resistant organisms in our
ICU. Reduced use of cephalosporins has resulted in a significantly
increased sensitivity of GNB to ciprofloxacin; however, resistance
to the carbapenems has increased. Infection control measures may
have helped reduce GPB infections. Monitoring changing trends in
bacterial resistance can help rationalize empirical antibiotic therapy
in the ICU.

Severe sepsis and septic shock in Croatian ICUs
I Gornik, V Gasparovic
Clinical Hospital Centre, Zagreb, Croatia
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P122 (doi:10.1186/cc4469)
Introduction Diagnosis of sepsis is one of the most frequent in
ICUs. Severe sepsis and septic shock, major complications of
infection with mortality rates of 20–60%, are among the gravest
problems for ICU physicians. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign with
its guidelines aims to reduce mortality of severe sepsis by 25%,
but no data concerning the incidence and mortality of sepsis in
Croatia existed until now. The purpose of our study was to
determine basic epidemiological facts about sepsis in Croatia.
Methods Twenty-four ICUs from five clinical hospitals and four
general hospitals participated in the project named croicu-net.
Participating units cover the population of about 1 million (roughly
one-quarter of the Croatian population). All patients admitted to the
participating ICUs were reported to the web database in which
patients with sepsis were given special attention. Data were
analyzed after the period of 1 year. National incidence was
estimated based on the portion of Croatian population covered by
the participating ICUs.
Results The participating ICUs reported a total of 5293
admissions. Sepsis at admission or during the ICU stay was
reported for 587 patients (11.1%), of which 180 (3.4%) met
criteria for severe sepsis and 129 (2.4%) for septic shock. ICU
mortality for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock
was 29.1%, 35% and 34.1%, respectively. The duration of ICU
stay for septic patients was 9.4 ± 1.1 days. Most of the patients
with sepsis (75%) were septic on admission. The most prevalent
source of the infection was the urinary tract (30.4%) followed by
the respiratory tract (21.1%). The most common failing organ
system was the respiratory system (73%). The most prevalent
microorganisms isolated from the blood cultures were E. coli
(11.6%), P. aeruginosa (9.9%) and MRSA (9.3%), and blood
cultures were negative in 24% patients. There were no differences
in incidence, mortality or LOS between surgical and medical ICUs.
There were significant differences in mortality and ICU stay
between the ICUs in clinical hospitals (28.7%; 8.3 ± 0.9 days)
compared with the ICUs in small towns (55.5%; 9.1 ± 1.3 days)
and large towns (31.8%; 8.6 ± 1.1 days), which did not match the
differences in severity of disease measured by APACHE II and
SOFA scores.
Conclusion Sepsis is one of the most prevalent reasons for
admission to ICUs in Croatia. The estimated annual incidence of
sepsis in Croatia is 0.06% of population. Differences in mortalities
and LOS could be reduced by equaling the quality of care, which
could be accomplished by following the Surviving Sepsis
Campaign guidelines. Planned data collection in the future will
show how much improvement will be accomplished.

Introduction In the context of the worldwide ongoing Surviving
Sepsis Campaign (SSC) we decided to characterize community-
acquired sepsis (CAS) of our country, using a Portuguese ICU
network. We intend to show compliance with the SSC bundles.
Methods A prospective multicentre nationwide study on
community-acquired sepsis in Portuguese ICUs was created in
2004. Seventeen units came together in this project, which lasted
from 1 December 2004 until 30 November 2005. During this
period data collection included epidemiological characteristics and
comorbidities, the community-acquired sepsis episode (locale of
infection, responsible organism, first intention antibiotherapy and
associated organ dysfunction) and the compliance with the SSC
bundles and recommendations.
Results During this period 2643 patients were included and 606
had CAS (23%). Five hundred and twenty patients (20%) had
severe sepsis/septic shock:
• 59% had serum lactate measured (median time from hospital
admission and serum lactate measurement was 6.58 hours)
and 65% had fluids administered to get a mean arterial
pressure of 65 mmHg in the first 6 hours of hospital admission;
• 92% had blood cultures done (median time from hospital
admission and blood cultures done was 8.6 hours) and 49%
had antibiotics administered in the first hour after sepsis
diagnosis (median time from hospital admission and
antibiotherapy administration was 5.08 hours);
• 80% had started glucose control measures, 91% had
ventilation programmed to achieved a plateau pressure
<30 cmH2O and 6% had drotrectogina administered in the
first 24 hours of hospital admission.
Two hundred and eighty patients had septic shock:
• 49% had CVP measured, 14% had SvcO2 measured, 81%
had vasopressors administered and 56% had inotropes in the
first 6 hours of hospital admission;
• 53% had low-dose corticoids administered in the first 24
hours of hospital admission.
Discussion We have a heterogeneous reality on CAS cases
admitted to the ICU. We planned courses on sepsis and severe
infection centred on SSC recommendations pretending to improve

Comparison of Belgian and US validation studies of
ICU-acquired infection surveillance
I Morales, A Versporten, C Suetens
Institut Scientifique de Santé Publique, Brussels, Belgium
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P124 (doi:10.1186/cc4471)
Introduction Many validation studies measured the effectiveness
of infection surveillance in ICUs. Few, such as Belgium and USA,
did so nationwide. The American National Nosocomial Infection
Surveillance System (NNIS, CDC) is a worldwide benchmark,
although its pilot study showed low sensitivity (SS) on detecting
ICU-acquired pneumonia infections (PN). This paper compares the
American and Belgian validation studies regarding methodology
and likely impact of design differences on PN surveillance
assessment.
Methods The methodology and capacity to estimate PN
surveillance’s performance of the Belgian and American validation
studies are assessed on epidemiological criteria.
Results The NNIS system set up an accuracy pilot study in 1993,
published in 1998. The sample included nine hospitals. All reported
nosocomial infections (NI) and a selection of high-risk and low-risk
PN-negative patients were examined. In a first phase, 32 external
data collectors found over 2.5 times more PN than reported. The
PN SS was 39% although hospitals with six consecutive month’s
surveillance participation and high NI incidence were chosen. In a
second phase, two CDC epidemiologists re-examined a
nonrepresentative sample of discrepant charts achieving 68%
PN SS. Confidence intervals were not reported.
The Belgian validation study used a blind retrospective chart
review as the NNIS. Investigators were members of the national
surveillance program (NSIH). A two-step (patient and ICU)
sampling was used. A sample for single proportion determined the
number of PN patients to be reviewed. To get the requested PN
cases, 45 ICUs were selected by systematic random sampling
from all ICU participation-quarters. The required negative charts
were a 20% random sample of all negative charts in these ICUs.
The PN SS was 56.31% (95% CI = 47.92–65.21).
Discussion The NSIH study re-examined a representative sample
of 45 out of all participating ICUs (30%), while the NNIS did so in
nine of them. At the patient level, the Belgian sample was
representative of the ICU case mix since all reported NI infections
and a random sample of reported negative charts were reviewed.
This methodology allowed CI determination.
The investigators’ experience is known to influence the accuracy of
identifying NI. Regular NSIH employees collected data in Belgium
while such personal was involved in the second phase of the NNIS
study only.
Conclusion The NSIH validation study tackles difficulties with
statistical inference found in the NNIS ‘accuracy of reporting pilot
study’. Given the differences in validation methodology, the
surveillance SS in both countries (NNIS: 39–68% in phase 2 vs
NSIH: 56%) should be compared cautiously.
Being part of a nationwide surveillance routinely performed on
continuous basis, the Belgian validation study design offers an
alternative to validate national surveillance systems.

Introduction A prospective multicentre nationwide study on
community-acquired sepsis (CAS) in Portuguese ICUs was
created in 2004 with two main objectives: to know the
epidemiology and to promote good practice. In this poster we
intend to show data collected in the first 10 months.
Methods Seventeen units came together in this project. It lasted
from 1 December 2004 until 30 November 2005. Data collection
included epidemiological characteristics and comorbidities, the
CAS episode (locale of infection, responsible organism, first
intention antibiotherapy and associated organ dysfunction) and the
compliance with the SSC recommendations. For statistics, the chi-
square and Mann–Whitney tests were used. P < 0.05 was
considered significant.
Results During this period 2643 patients were included in the
study and 606 had CAS (23%) — of these, 240 (41%) had severe
sepsis and 280 (48%) septic shock. Men had more sepsis (33%
of all men) than women (25%, P = 0.004). No significant
association was seen between age and sepsis, severity of sepsis
or mortality. Twenty-three percent (137 patients) of the septic
patients had an infection associated with health care. Forty percent
had a microbiologically documented infection, 22% had positive
blood cultures. Patients with sepsis had a longer ICU stay
(median = 8 days) than those without (median = 5 days). This
difference is significant for those who survive (median = 9 vs
5 days, P < 0.01) and for those who died (median = 6 vs 5 days,
P = 0.049). Patients with sepsis had higher ICU mortality rate than
those without (31% vs 22%, P < 0.01).
Discussion Comparing with previous similar studies we had: more
patients admitted with CAS; more severe sepsis and septic shock;
similar distribution by focus of infection; and a low number of
microbiological documented infections. New analyses are being
done regarding the focus of infection and severity of sepsis,
responsible agent, first intention antibiotherapy and mortality.

Sepsis: a study of physician’s knowledge about the
Surviving Sepsis Campaign in Puerto Rico

San Juan VA Hospital, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P126 (doi:10.1186/cc4473)
Background In recent years, an increase incidence of sepsis has
been reported. The literature suggests that over 650,000 cases of
sepsis are diagnosed annually in the United States, leading to
more than 100,000 deaths.
Despite medical and technological advances in treatment, the
overall mortality rate in most institutions has remained between 40
and 45%. In 2003, a group of international critical care and
infectious diseases physicians gathered to develop guidelines to
improve the outcome of patients with sepsis. At the end of that
year the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines were
published for sepsis management.
Objective To measure the degree of physician’s knowledge of the
SSC management guidelines in Puerto Rico.
Methods A validated questionnaire was given personally to 160
physicians. It included therapeutic interventions and important
elements of the above guidelines. It was administered to a broad
base of physicians including internal medicine and general surgery
along with subspecialties from public and private hospitals around
the entire island.
The questionnaire included a total of 13 questions. Questions 1–4
address general knowledge regarding the SSC and its goals.
Question 5 measures knowledge of the diagnostic criteria for
SIRS. Question 6 addresses outcome of severe sepsis. Questions
7–13 look at the specific guidelines.
Results Although 90% of all responders knew of the published
guidelines, 60.1% and 36.8% had heard of the SSC or the sepsis
bundles, respectively. Only 31.4% correctly identified SIRS
criteria. Of the questions concerning bundle components, the
worst scores were on those focused on use of steroids (32.5%),
glucose control (40.9%) and ventilation (46%). Regarding our
institution, which is a teaching hospital, there was no statistically
significant difference in the percentage of correct answers
between postgraduate year PGY-1 and PGY-2 residents
(P = 0.51) or PGY-3 residents (P = 0.61). No significant
differences were found between attending physicians and PGY-3
residents (P = 0.80).
Conclusions Recognizing septic patients remains a clinical
challenge. Our results revealed no difference in knowledge
between in-training doctors and private physicians. This is quite
unexpected, as one would anticipate improved knowledge through
years of training. These results prove that future strategies to
correct these deficiencies are needed.

Introduction A prospective multicentre nationwide study on
community-acquired sepsis (CAS) in Portuguese ICUs was carried
out with two main objectives: to promote good practice through
implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC)
recommendation and to know the epidemiology, which is essential
in the treatment of sepsis. In this presentation we intend to show
how clinical practice changed over time.
Methods Seventeen units came together in this project. It lasted
from 1 December 2004 until 30 November 2005. Data collection
included epidemiological characteristics and comorbidities, the
CAS episode (locale of infection, responsible organism, first inten-
tion antibiotherapy and associated organ dysfunction) and the
compliance with the SSC bundles and recommendations — following
a detailed protocol that contained a summarized description of all
SSC guidelines. We consider for this poster the first 10 months of
the study and compare the compliance of the SSC bundles in the
first month with the last 2 months of this period (December
2004/January 2005 vs August/September 2005). The 95%
confidence interval (95% CI) for the difference of proportions and
Fisher’s exact test were used to analyse categorical data; P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results During this period, 2643 patients were included in the
study and 606 had CAS (23%) — of those, 520 (20%) had severe
sepsis/septic shock. Over time more patients with septic shock
received inotropes (45% vs 88%, 95% CI 0.149–0.701, P 49),
had SvcO2 measured (8% vs 32%, 95% CI 0.073–0.412,
P < 0.01) and low-dose corticoids administered (38% vs 70%,
95% CI 0.123–0.510, P < 0.01). No significant difference was
seen for CVP measurement (57% vs 47%, 95% CI –0.299 to
–0.105, P = 0.408) or administration of vasopressors (78% vs
95%, 95% CI 0.035–0.307, P = 0.102).
In the last 2 months more patients had specimens collected for
microbiological studies before antibiotic administration (72% vs
85%, 95% CI 0.010–0.250, P = 0.067) and more blood cultures
done (89% vs 97%, 95% CI 0.010–0.142, P = 0.1). No significant
differences were found in the first 6 hours of hospital admission
for: measurement of serum lactate (61% vs 64%, 95% CI –0.121
to 0.186, P = 0.74), administration of fluids (67% vs 67%, 95% CI
–0.145 to 0.158, P = 1.0) and antimicrobial administration (47%
vs 49%, 95% CI –0.140 to 0.188, P = 0.867). No significant
difference was seen in mortality in both periods.
Discussion During the study period our performance improved in
the compliance of the majority of the bundles. We need to
feedback to the participating ICUs the weak points of their practice
on the SSC recommendations implementation as part of the audit
process.

Introduction On 26 December 2004, a giant earthquake shocked
south-east Asia triggering deadly flood waves (tsunami) across the
Indian Ocean. More than 300,000 people have been reported
dead and millions left destitute. Shortly thereafter, the German
government organized airborne home transfer of the most severely
injured tourists using ‘MedEvac’ aircraft (Medical Evacuation).
Upon arrival, patients were distributed to various medical centers.
One cohort was admitted to the Cologne-Merheim Medical Center
(Germany) for further surgical and ICU treatment.
Objective To describe the unique pattern of injuries and micro-
biological findings associated with the 2004 Tsunami disaster.
Critical Care March 2006 Vol 10 Suppl 1 26th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine
S55
Methods Seventeen severely injured tsunami victims were
screened upon arrival for characteristic injury patterns. In parallel,
multilocal microbiological assessment was performed to identify
pathogens responsible for high-level wound contamination.
Results The predominant pattern of injury comprised multiple
large-scale soft-tissue wounds (range: 2 × 3–60 × 60 cm2) located
at lower (88%) and upper extremities (29%), but also the head
(18%). Additional injuries included thoracic trauma with hemo-
pneumothorax and serial rib fractures (41%) and peripheral bone
fractures (47%). A major problem associated with wound
management was significant contamination. Microbiological
assessment identified a variety of common (Pseudomonas 54%,
Enterobacteriae 36%, Aeromonas hydrophilia/veronii 27%) but
also uncommon isolates with high resistances (multiresistant
Acinetobacter and ESBL-positive E. coli 18% each). Upper
respiratory tract specimens contained an unusual high rate of
multiresistant Acinetobacter species, but also MRSA,
A. hydrophilia, Pseudomonas and Candida albicans.
Conclusion Individuals who survived their initial injuries and who
were evacuated to Europe had traumatic injuries to the head,
chest, and limbs that were often contaminated with highly resistant
bacteria. Transferred patients from disaster areas should be placed
into isolation until their microbial flora is identified as they may
introduce new pathogens into an ICU.

Introduction Major trauma is accompanied by a marked
inflammatory reaction that involves infiltration of blood polymorpho-
nuclear leucocytes (PMNs) into the injured area. This process is
dynamic and evolves rapidly over the first 24–72 hours after injury.
Activated PMNs can contribute to tissue damage by release of
oxygen radicals, proteolytic enzymes and proinflammatory
cytokines. The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that
occurs early after major trauma is characterized by a neutrophil
infiltrate within the lungs. Also the inflammation, in response to
brain injury, involves infiltration of neutrophils into the injured brain
parenchyma.
Purpose The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that the
outcome of severe traumatized patients would be influenced by the
PMN count.
Methods From December 2004 to November 2005, 40 multiple
injured patients (28 male, 12 female, mean age 39 ± 18 years old)
admitted to our ICU were retrospectively studied. The study
protocol was approved by the local ethics committee. Ten of them
had severe brain injury (GCS < 8) and 30 were admitted after
major multiple trauma (ISS > 20). From the hematologic tests of
the first 2 days post injury drawn from their records, the total
peripheral leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count and absolute
lymphocyte count were recorded. The average values of the first 2
days for total leucocytes, absolute neutrophils and absolute
lymphocytes were calculated for each patient. The overall outcome
of the patients in the hospital was also recorded. The Student t test
and the chi-square test were used for statistical analysis.
Results Patients were divided into two groups according to their
outcome. The absolute neutrophil count in survivors was
significantly lower than those in nonsurvivors (P = 0.01). No
significant difference was found in total leukocyte count and
absolute lymphocyte count between the groups. The mortality rate
was significantly higher in patients with absolute neutrophils
>8000 than in those with absolute neutrophils <8000 (P = 0.03).

Conclusion A high absolute neutrophil count detected at the first

The aim of our study was the organization and tactics optimization
of the interhospital transport of critical patients with polytrauma.
During the past 5 years the proper transport service of the Federal
State Medical Prophylactic Institution Scientific Clinical Center of
Miners’ Health Protection (Leninsk-Kuznetsky) delivered 1023
patients from Kuzbass territory and other nearby regions, 390 of
them were in a critical state. During the transportation 121 patients
were conducted on MLV, 48 of them used PEEP. The antishock
cloth ‘Chestnut’ was used in the transportation of 358 patients.
Motor-car transportation was carried out for a 400 km distance; a
helicopter was used for a long distance in individual cases. The
maximum transportation time was 4 hours. During the transportation
we determined the central hemodynamics and oxygen-transport
function parameters.
The state of 110 of 390 transported critical patients with
polytrauma was appreciated as decompensated. According to the
ISS, the severity value = 24 ± 4 marks. The prognosis of the

probable lethal outcome during the nearest day was 100%.
Transportation realized by the specialized team did not deteriorate
the patients’ state thanks to the conducted complex intensive
therapy and prophylactic measures, in 19% cases a tendency to
improvement of the state was observed. Lethal outcome during
transportation was not registered.
The solution of the problem of safe interhospital transport of critical
patients with polytrauma depends on the exact coordination of all
interested services. Apart from the main quality criteria the
essential point is competent guidance of the whole system that is
connected with the clinics and transport service in this case.
All these components secure the high quality of the transportation
of critical patients.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P131 (doi:10.1186/cc4478)
Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a
helicopter-transported medical team (HMT) on the prehospital
treatment of vitally compromised children. The study was
performed in a Dutch HMT that provides advanced medical care in
the eastern part of The Netherlands. The HMT consists of a
specially trained physician and paramedic transported to the
incident location by helicopter in the day-time. The Dutch HMT is
activated together with the emergency medical service (EMS) by
the dispatch centre or by the EMS paramedics at the incident
location. Activation is according to a structured list of incident
situations and/or the medical condition of the patient.
Design Retrospective analysis of 297 HMT calls for prehospital
vitally comprised children (<16 years) from 2001 to 2005 by the
HMT-Netherlands-East. Registered data included age, sex,
physiological parameters and medical treatment. Specified was
whether the medical procedures performed outside the hospital
were provided by the EMS paramedic or the HMT physician; in all
cases, EMS paramedics arrived at the incident location first.
Medical procedures in children were classified into three groups:
restricted to physician by Dutch law, physician more experienced
than EMS paramedic, physician and EMS paramedic as
experienced as each other. SPSS was used for descriptive analysis.
Results The EMS on scene canceled the pediatric HMT calls
before the landing of the helicopter in 36% (n = 107) — reasons:
no serious injury 82% (n = 88), deceased 10% (n = 11), other 8%
(n = 8).
The HMT examined and treated 190 children on scene, with a total
of 1461 medical procedures provided by the HMT physician (mean
7.7, SD 3.9). Medical procedures restricted to HMT physicians
were given to 71% (n = 135) of the children (e.g. general
anesthesia, thoracosynthesis, central venous cannulation). Medical
procedures when classified as the HMT physician more
experienced than the EMS paramedic were given to 76% (n = 144)
of the children (e.g. endotracheal intubation, intra-osseous infusion,
pain management). The combination of these two groups
constituted 84% (n = 158) of all children examined by the HMT.
Conclusion The Dutch-HMT provides crucial additional medical
expertise not provided by the EMS paramedics. Eighty-four percent
of the vitally compromised children received a prehospital medical
procedure restricted to a physician or for which a physician was
more experienced.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P132 (doi:10.1186/cc4479)
Objectives In order to reduce the waiting period before surgical
treatment, the CORTIM project aims to develop a management
system with the use of the NTIC system and operational radio
network. To assess the benefits of a medical operational information
system, we compared the current procedure (EVASAN) and the
procedure of the CORTIM concept.
In EVASAN, evacuation of the injured soldiers is performed
through mandatory stages of treatment or dispatching. Emergency
categorization is made at surgical clearing center after first-level
evacuation from the battalion first-aid post. Medical reports are
written on the Field Medical Card (NATO format).
In CORTIM, the front unit medical officer collects medical data
through a computer software application and transmits reports to
the brigade surgeon who organizes MEDEVACs and can dispatch
casualties directly to the specified field hospitals that are able to
treat respective injuries.
Methods During the large-scale manoeuvre of an armoured
brigade, MEDEVACs of seven casualties were performed with
EVASAN and CORTIM procedures. Each procedure had at its
disposal three places in helicopters, and four places in
ambulances. The medical chain included one Front Unit Medical
Team, one Forward Surgical Team with one operating room, and
one Field Hospital with three operating rooms.
The data collected were quality of information written on the Field
Medical Card and waiting periods before surgical treatment (in
minutes).
Results On the Field Medical Card, only 54.5% of administrative
and medical information is written, 70% of which with errors. With
the medical electronic device, all the information required is
available.
The compared waiting periods before surgical treatment are shown
in Fig. 1. For 5/7 casualties, the CORTIM procedure and medical
regulation reduced the waiting period before surgery. For three of
them, the period was reduced from 220 min to less than 150 min.
Conclusion In our experiment, using a medical electronic device
improved the quality of medical information and the CORTIM
procedure reduced the time period before surgery.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P133 (doi:10.1186/cc4480)
Introduction Trauma is the major cause of death for people
younger than 40 years in developed counties. In Italy an incidence
of 120 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants for trauma is reported. An
efficient emergency medical response system (EMRS) must
therefore be assured in order to provide adequate treatment on the
scene and allow a quick rescue to a referral hospital centre.
Methods The area of Florence in Tuscany consists of a population
of 1.5 million inhabitants. In this area the EMRS is provided by a
network of land ambulances staffed with an emergency physician
and a helicopter with an intensivist on board.
In this study we considered all 291 trauma patients initially
admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) and subsequently
admitted to the eight-bed ICU of Careggi Hospital in Florence in
the period from January 2003 to June 2005. Two groups of
patients were considered: 144 patients rescued by the helicopter
(group A) and 147 patients rescued by land (group B). The two
groups were confronted for the category of trauma, GCS, SpO2,
fluid resuscitation volume, mean artery pressure (MAP), on-scene
intubation, intubation within 5 min of arrival at the ED, scene time,
lactates at ED admission, ICU LOS, and ICU mortality.
Results The groups’ results were comparable for sex, age, trauma
severity scoring, GCS and mean ICU LOS (group B 11.3 ± 10.5
days; group A 9.1 ± 7.9 days). Statistically significant differences*
in the two groups were reported concerning the following
variables: SpO2 (group A 95.85% ± 5.21; group B 93.53% ±
8.06*); time on scene (group B 30.3 min; group A 36.52 min*);
fluid resuscitation volume and MAP (group B 916.5 ml ± 513.16
and 89.9 mmHg ± 14.5; group A 1122.7 ml ± 564.37 and 92.7
mmHg ± 20.3); out-of-hospital intubation (group B 29%; group A
56.25%*); intubation in the ED (group B 40.8%; group A 11.1%*);
lactates at ED admission (group B 3.06; group A 2.0*); and ICU
mortality (group B 19.2%*; group A 13.2%).
Conclusions In our model, air rescue with a helicopter with an
intensivist on board assures a higher standard of care, in
comparison with land rescue. These achievements positively affect
the outcome, with a decrease in ICU LOS and mortality.

Elastic fixation of the diaphyseal fractures of the femoral
bone in children

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P134 (doi:10.1186/cc4481)
The standard treatment of most fractures of the femoral bone in
children was conservative. There are a variety of circumstances (poly-
trauma, head injury, open fracture, vascular injuries, impossibility of the
satisfactory reposition by traction) that require surgical operation.
The aim of this study is the appreciation of the diaphyseal
fractures’ fixation using the elastic pins.
We propose the experience of the use of the elastic pins in nine
patients (seven boys, two girls) aged from 7 to 12 years, with
closed fractures of the femoral bones’ diaphysis, who were treated
by close reposition method with following elastic pins’ fixation.
The causes of the trauma were the results of traffic incidents: six
cases (66%), street incidents: three cases (34%), fall from a
height. Six patients had a polytrauma and three had the isolated
trauma. All fractures were closed, transverse or oblique-transverse.
The time of stay in the hospital from admission to surgery was
1.5–15 hours.
During the first week the patients were in a bed regimen, beginning
from the second week their ambulation was exercised with
crutches. Hospital stays lasted from 12 to 29 days (average 15.7
bed-days). The complete load was allowable in 8 weeks after
surgery. One case demonstrated a reverse prolapse of the pins in
4 months, which were removed because of the fracture’s fusion.
There were no other complications. All fractures knitted well during
8–10 weeks. The observation time was from 8 to 26 months.
We used the ESIP principle in the treatment of femoral fractures by
two elastic pins in children aged from 7 to 12 years. This method
allows one to combine stable and elastic immobilization. The
stability is achieved not only by pins, but by the surrounding soft
tissue. The bone forms the axial stability in the cortical contact
when the pins are fixed in the metaphysis. Rotation stability is
created using the incurvated pins that compose the three-point
fixation. Elastic mobility allows one to have the determined motion
amplitude at the fracture’s site, stimulating callus formation.

Treatment of pelvic fractures of patients with polytrauma

Russian Federation
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P135 (doi:10.1186/cc4482)
We treated 310 patients with pelvic fractures. According to the
classification of M.Tile, the fractures were allocated in the following
manner: A, 43%; B, 29%; C, 28%. Forty-four percent of these
patients were admitted with different rates of severity of shock
state. Osteosynthesis was carried out in 44% cases: 23%, external
fixation only; 9%, internal constructions only; and 12%, combined
synthesis. The treatment of pelvic fractures must correspond to the
requirements of anti-shock measures and to the treatment of intra-
articular lesions. The most informative method of the radial
diagnosis is CT examination with three-dimensional pelvic
reconstruction. We oriented toward the severity of pelvic lesion (A,
B, C) for the determination of the terms, the volume and the order
of surgical interventions. We carried out the total volume of
surgical interventions in the consideration of the severity of pelvic
lesions in the shock of I and II rates. We used internal or combined
osteosynthesis in the partial or total loss of pelvic stability (B and C
types). Internal osteosynthesis of the pelvis is biomechanically
substantiated, because it regains the circular form and,
consequently, also the pelvic stability, it decreases hemorrhage
from the fracture regions, and it removes the pain more rapidly.
Hemorrhage compensation was realized by intraoperative
autohemotransfusion. In case of another dominant lesion, we
operated by means of two brigades. In the shock of III and IV rates
we carried out the pelvic stabilization only by the external fixation
apparatus for the improvement of the common state of the patient.
Closed reposition and osteosynthesis by external fixation
apparatus with an anterior frame does not ensure complete
success in the fractures of type C, but it is the most rapid method
to obtain and to maintain reposition in the future.
Functional results were appreciated at the moment of discharge
and after 12 months according to the Majeed S.A. scale (1989)
and according to the data of computerized optic topography to
appreciate the postural balance. Good and excellent results

(70–100 points for the workers and 55–80 points for nonworkers)
were in 48% patients at the moment of discharge and in 78%
patients after 12 months. The lethality value was 5.5%. The invalidism
value was 7%. The mean time of hospital stay was 34 days and the
mean time of resuscitation department stay was 1.5 days.
The treatment of the patients with severe injuries of the pelvis in
polytrauma must be realized in special clinics, with necessary
equipment and specially prepared nursing. Treatment tactics
depend on the severity of the common state and on the severity of
pelvic injuries.

Hôpital d’instruction des armées Laveran, Marseille, France
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P136 (doi:10.1186/cc4483)
Background Common use of body armor (BA) and kevlar helmets
by soldiers has lead to a change in war penetrating injuries.
Methods From 2002 to 2005, the anaesthesiologist and surgical
staff of the Military Hospital Laveran, Marseille, France, participated
in the combat support hospital for an international task force during
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Ivory Coast.
Prospective data were collected on all combat casualties affecting
wounded soldiers equipped with BA.
Results One hundred and sixteen wounded soldier cases wearing
BA were included. The incidence of bullet wounds was 2%, of
shell/rockets was 47%, of fragments of grenade was 16%, of
mines was 6% and of bombing explosions was 29%. Injuries
topographically affected the head, groin and neck (23%), thorax
(10%), abdomen (3%) and extremities (96%).
Twelve percent died on the battlefield. Eighty-two percent of
wounded soldiers reached the medical facility before 25 ± 15 min
and were evacuated with a medical team to the combat support
hospital in 127 ± 65 min between attack and admission; vital
emergencies accounted for 17%, including 83% of hemorrhagic
shock, 28% of respiratory distress and 11% of coma. After
surgical care, the wounded soldiers had strategic medical
evacuation to a military hospital in France in 37 ± 15 hours.
Discussion In the urban battlefield since Sarajevo (1992–1996)
and Mogadishu (1993), bullet wounds of soldiers equipped with
BA were higher (60%) than in our study (2%), whereas fragment
injuries were fewer (30% vs 98%) [1,2]. Without BA, injuries
affected the head and face (11%), chest (19.5%), abdomen
(25.8%) and limbs (68.9%). In our study, penetrating injuries
affected essentially the limbs (100%) and head (23%), but the
thorax (10%) and abdomen (3%) were protected. The incidence of
fatal wounds was similar in spite of modern BA (11–12%) but vital
emergencies decreased in our study (17%) compared with injuries
in the urban battlefield (44%). In the battlefield, delayed
evacuations were typical because of unsafe air space, but
wounded soldiers could receive fast medical facility and evacuation
to intensive care and surgical support.
Conclusion Modern BA has reduced the number of fatal
penetrating chest and abdominal injuries, and vital emergencies
have decreased, but not the death rate, despite the efficiency of
the combat medical support chain, because of specific employing
of weapons (lethal injuries due to sniping, in the urban battlefield,
aerial attacks, mine or bombing explosions).

Background It is widely accepted that planning a trauma system,
which allows the centralization of major trauma to the trauma
centers with a high volume of activity, is able to reduce the
mortality of trauma [1]. Nevertheless, the reorganization of the
inhospital trauma care could improve the outcome of major trauma
even in absence of a well-designed trauma system.
Methods Retrospective evaluation of the impact on outcome of a
standardized approach to the trauma patients admitted to a
general ICU in an 450-bed hospital not designated as a trauma
center. The interventions adopted were the following:
• Specific training of all the physicians and the nurses involved
in the trauma care in the Emergency Department and the ICU.
• Formal adoption of the team approach for trauma patients and
of specific guidelines for the diagnostic and therapeutic
pathway in the Emergency Department.
• Agreement between the prehospital and inhospital trauma
teams on the clinical and dynamic criteria used to alert the
trauma team in the field.
• Formal adoption of specific therapeutic protocols for the
trauma patient in the ICU.
• The data of 1 year of activity, before, during and after the inter-
ventions, were collected and analyzed with the chi-square test.
Results There was an increase of the number of patients from 44 to
69 and 66 per year without differences in the mean age (38.8 ±
21.6, 38.2 ± 18.8 and 42.2 ± 22.6 years) and severity scores
(SAPS II: 30.2 ± 14.2, 31.4 ± 14.3, 31.4 ± 12.8; ISS: 29.2 ± 12.1,
28.2 ± 12.0, 29.6 ± 11.9), respectively, in 2003, 2004, and 2005.
There was a progressive increase of the use of some therapeutic
techniques, such as FAST and the CT study of the C-spine in the
Emergency Department and non-invasive ventilation and
ultrafiltration in ICU. The mortality showed a reduction from 36.3%
in 2003 to 24.6% in 2004 and 17.2% in 2005, with a statistically
significant difference between 2003 and 2005 (P = 0.034).
Conclusion A reorganization of the response of the hospital to the
trauma could improve the outcome even in the absence of a trauma
system and a high volume of activity.

Introduction The purpose of this study is to determine the

Methods Over a 6-year period, 22 ICU patients developed
empyema (1.5% of total admissions). Mean age: 41.1 ± 16.2
years. Mean stay: 21.4 ± 8.7 days. Initial APACHE II score: 17.1 ±

3.1. All patients underwent mechanical ventilation. Empyema was
diagnosed at admission in four patients (18.2%) or during the ICU
stay in 18 patients (81.8%). In all patients pus or bacteria was
present in the pleural cavity. Besides the daily chest X-ray, a CT
scan was performed at least twice during their stay.
Results Causes of empyema: pneumonia 10, mediastinitis 4,
subphrenic abscess 3, hematogenous spread 3, soft tissue
infection 2. Underlying diseases: chest injury in multiple trauma
patients 15, chest surgery 5, other 2. Radiographic pattern: free
pleural effusion: 18 patients (81.8%), loculated four patients
(18.2%). In cultures of pleural fluid and blood were isolated:
P. aeruginosa 38%, A. baumannii 26%, S. aureus 18%,
S. epidermidis 7%, K. pneumoniae 7%, E. coli 4% (in eight patients
polymicrobial, while two patients had frank pus but no bacteria were
isolated). Pericardial effusion was present in five patients (22.7%).
Twelve patients (54.5%) were treated with chest drainage alone
(single or multiple), while in 10 patients (45.5%) several thoraco-
surgical procedures were required (four patients were operated
twice and one patient three times). Antibiotics were administered
according to sensitivity tests. Mortality rates: 3/22 = 13.6%.
Conclusions Empyema is rare in the ICU, but it presents severe
clinical features and increases the length of stay. Pneumonia is the
commonest cause of empyema, followed by mediastinal and
abdominal surgical infections. In more than 80% the chest X-ray
revealed free pleural effusion. In more than 45% tube chest
drainage alone was not effective to treat empyema. Causative
pathogens of empyema did not differ from common ICU isolates.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P139 (doi:10.1186/cc4486)
Introduction Combination antifungal therapy (CAT) appears an
appealing option in critically ill patients with invasive fungal infections
(IFI), especially in those experiencing failure to primary therapy.
Methods From November 2003 to April 2005, 18 patients affected
by IFI (eight with candidemia due to C. albicans, three due to
C. glabrata, two due to C. krusei, and five with pulmonary asper-
gillosis), who had failed primary antifungal therapy, were treated with
caspofungin (CAS) 70 mg on the first day, and 50 mg thereafter, plus
low-dose (LD) amphotericin B deoxycholate (dAmB) 0.5 mg/kg/day.
All patients had high-risk underlying conditions (five acute
myelogenous leukemias, six solid tumors, five prolonged ICU stays,
and two major abdominal surgical interventions). Failure to prior
therapy was determined by: fever and worsening of clinical
conditions, and persistent candidemia, or worsening of the lung CT
scan together with increase of Aspergillus galactomannan
antigenemia (AGA), after 96 hours from the start of antifungal therapy.
Results All 18 patients were clinically unstable and critically ill, and
13 out of 18 had been admitted to the ICU at the time of switching
therapy; five patients never required admission to ICU. All patients
survived. Within 72–96 hours from the beginning of CAT, indeed,
the clinical stability and fever clearance, together with a negative
blood culture, or negative AGA were observed, and confirmed
thereafter. LD dAmB did not require any premedication, but none
of the patients suffered from side effects, and nor was treatment
discontinuation needed. The mean CAT duration was 26 days, but
the mean ICU stay was 9 days, before patient transfer to either
medical or surgical wards. None of the patients relapsed within a
follow up period of at least 60 days from the end of treatment.
Conclusions CAT including new drugs, such as CAS, is an
appealing option supported by promising data. In our experience,
CAT with CAS and LD dAmB appears effective in critically ill
patients with IFI failing primary treatment. The experimentally
demonstrated synergistic activity of dAmB, even at LD, plus CAS
seems to be clinically relevant; due to the safety demonstrated, LD
dAmB also allows remarkable cost sparing in comparison with lipid
formulations. Moreover, compared with the available clinical data in
similar situations, both the time to clinical stability and time to
discharge from the ICU appear shortened in patients under CAT.
Wider clinical studies in these selected settings are needed to
clarify the impact on survival of this salvage treatment schedule.

Introduction In past years there has been an increase in the
occurrence of systemic fungal infections in ICUs. Although
Candida species are the leading cause of hospital fungal
infections, severely ill patients can develop invasive infection by
emerging fungus or by innocuous inhabitants of the environment.
Objective To describe the occurrence of bloodstream and urinary
tract infections in ICUs of a cardiology hospital.
Methods We analyzed all cases of bloodstream and urinary tract
fungal infections that occurred in two clinical ICUs at the Heart
Institute of São Paulo University School of Medicine from January
2000 to November 2005.
Results Among 376 bloodstream infections, 26 (6.9%) were
caused by Candida species and one by Trichosporon spp.
Seventy-three percent of candidaemia occurred in the last 2 years
of study. The mean age was 61.6 years and the mean ICU length
of stay before the diagnosis was 35 days. The following Candida
species were identified: C. albicans = 42%, C. parapsilosis =
23%, C. tropicalis = 19%, C. glabrata = 11% and C. guillermondi =
4%. Among 585 urinary tract infections episodes, 253 (43%) were
caused by fungi: 47% by C. albicans, 34% by non-albicans
Candida species and 18% by Trichosporon spp.
Conclusions We observed an increasing incidence of
bloodstream fungal infections caused by non-albicans Candida
species, predominantly in the last 2 years in severely ill long-staying
inhospital cardiac patients. Trichosporon spp. is a fungus once
thought to cause only superficial infections, but has been
increasingly identified as an opportunistic systemic pathogen in
severely immunodepressed patients. The occurrence of
bloodstream infection and the high incidence of urinary tract
infection caused by Trichosporon spp. in this study led us to begin
a prospective study to identify risk factors and treatment strategies.

frequently seen ICU infections. Among Candida species, Candida
albicans is the most frequently seen yeast infection. We aimed to
investigate the candidemia–candiduria ratio, their risk factors, and
their mortality and morbidity in ICU patients.
Methods Intensive care medical records of 935 patients who
attended an ICU between 2002 and 2005 were analyzed
retrospectively. The risk factors, mortality and morbidity of
candiduria–candidemia infections were assessed.
Results Candida infections developed in 28 of all patients
(Table 1). The ratio of candidemia/yeast infection was 32%. Risk
factors of Candida infections are presented in Table 2. Even
though the mortality ratio of ICU was 39.4%, it was found to be
57.9% in candiduria and 66.7% in candidemia.

ICU, Clinic Universitary Hospital, Santiago de Compostela, Spain
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P142 (doi:10.1186/cc4489)
Background Since 1973 the total number of cases of tetanus in our
ICU is 30, almost all before 1990 (22 cases). Since 2000, six cases
have taken place. The aim of the present study was to describe the
characteristics of infection by Clostridium tetani in this period.
Methods We retrospectively analysed the data of tetanus from
2000 to 2005. Clinical features, treatment and comorbidities were
recorded.
Results Six cases of tetanus were described in this period: two
cases of cephalic tetanus and four of generalized tetanus. Study
patients had a mean age of 64 years (three were male), and period
of the year was one case in spring, three in summer, two in autumn.
The mean incubation period (from inoculation to first symptom)
was 7 days in cephalic tetanus and 15 days in generalized tetanus,
and the mean period of onset (from first symptom to first spasm)
10.5 days in cephalic tetanus and 14.5 days in generalized
tetanus. The mean ICU length of stay was 28.2 ± 13 days, and the
mean hospital length of stay was 43 ± 21 days. Mean days under
mechanical ventilation were 21 ± 10 days. Clinical manifestations
included trismus and generalized spasm in all cases, facial nerve
paralysis in both cases of cephalic tetanus and abdominal pain in
one case of generalized tetanus. All patients were treated with
metronidazol, antitetanus immunoglobulin and toxin. Sedatives
(midazolam and propofol) and neuromuscular blocking agents
(cisatracurio and vecuronium) were used. Tracheostomy was
performed in all cases as soon as possible. Complications
included ventilator-associated pneumonia in four cases, infection of
the urinary tract in two cases, asystole in one case, acute renal
failure in one case, and seizures in one case. All patients were
discharged from the ICU. One of them died in the hospital.
Conclusions Tetanus is a rare disease in the ICU, but with low
mortality. Strategies to fight tetanus include the training of the
intensivist in earlier diagnosis and adequate interventions (attention to
the airway and to ventilation is paramount at the time of presentation).
Tetanus is entirely preventable worldwide. Revaccinating the
population with antitetanus toxin might be considered in our setting.

Analytical survey of human rabies prevalence in the
province of Kerman, Iran

Medical University of Rafsanjan, Iran
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P143 (doi:10.1186/cc4490)
In order to determine the frequency rates of domestic and wild
animal bites as well as the evaluation of the prevalence rates of
rabies disease in human population in the province of Kerman, a
retrospective study was designed to analyze statistically the
collected recorded data related to this project. The required data
such as the numbers of persons who were bitten by animals, the
distribution of the studied variables such as geographical
locations, age groups of people, jobs and professional
relationships, pre-exposure prophylaxis treatment for rabies, and
topographical conditions of the injured organs of bodies due to the
animal bites, as well as the mortality rates of individuals resulting
from rabies, were collected during one decade starting from 21
March 1994 to 21 March 2003 in all 10 cities including the rural
areas of the province of Kerman. All data were finally analyzed by
SPSS software (Version 11.5).
On the basis of recorded statistical analysis, the mortality cases of
human rabies in the province of Kerman during one decade was 10
persons (eight males and two females). One-half of them (50%)
were bitten by dogs and the others (50%) by foxes. The mean of
age of the people who were bitten by dogs was 24.80 years (SD =
±14.6), while the mean age of the people who were bitten by foxes
was 57.25 years (SD = ±1.50). There was a significant difference
between the mean age of these two groups of the people
(P < 0.05). The most frequent rate of injured people was reported
in the age group of 10–19 years old and the frequency rate of
males (76.00%) was more than females (24.00%). There was
therefore statistically a significant difference between males and
females in this study (P < 0.01).
Among the people who were bitten and injured by animals during
one decade in the province of Kerman, 85.70% of them have not
been treated by a rabies prophylaxis treatment regimen. Among all
of them who were bitten by animals, 50% were injured through the
hands and feet, 40% of them through heads and faces, and 10%
of them through trunks, cervical regions and other organs of the

region, the mean time of the latency period for rabies was 33 days
(SD = ±12.2 days), while the mean time of the latency period in

the persons who were bitten through the hands and feet was 77
days (SD = ±45.8 days). P < 0.1. The results of this study showed
that there is a significant reciprocal correlation between the annual
raining level and the frequency rate of animal bites in the province
of Kerman (r = 0.5, P < 0.01).
According to this study, the role of foxes in the epidemiological
cycle of human rabies in the province of Kerman, located in the
south-east of Iran, seems very important.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P144 (doi:10.1186/cc4491)
Background Antibiotic treatment represents a key component of
therapy for severe sepsis. Apart from the sensibility of the causing
microorganisms, when choosing antimicrobial agents in septic
conditions possible effects of antibiotics on the microcirculation,
inflammatory mediators and vascular (hypo)reactivity should be
taken into account.
Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of
metronidazole (MET), imipenem (IMI), tobramycin (TOB) and vanco-
mycin (VAN) on the intestinal microcirculation in septic rats using
intravital microscopy (IVM), on the release of the cytokines TNF-α,
IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10, and on the in-vitro reactivity of the rat aorta.
Methods We induced sepsis in the animals (Lewis rats) using the
Colon Ascendens Stent Peritonitis (CASP) model. MET (10 mg/kg),
IMI (20 mg/kg), TOB (25 mg/kg) and VAN (70 mg/KG) were given
intravenously 16 hours following sepsis induction. Intravital
microscopic examination was performed 2 hours later. Cytokine
release was estimated at the end of the experiments. Direct effects
of the antibiotics on vascular tonus were studied in normal rat aortal
rings in-vitro precontracted either with phenylephrine (PE) (5 × 10–8 M)
or 20/40 mM KCl.
Results In the CASP model we observed a reduced functional
capillary density in the muscular and mucosal layers of the intestine
and an increased number of temporary and firmly adhering leukocytes
in submucosal venules. Acute treatment with MET attenuated this
response. TNF-α release in untreated CASP animals was twice as
high as compared with MET-treated animals. In vitro, higher
concentrations (up to 10–4 M) of some antibiotics produced moderate
relaxation: TOB 47% (PE), VAN 44% (PE), MET 48% (20 mM KCl).
Conclusion Antibiotics may exert, in addition to their antimicrobial
action, effects on the microcirculation, and potentially could
influence vascular (hypo)reactivity in septic conditions.

Objectives Patients encountering severe trauma are at high risk of
developing MOF, which is often associated with an unregulated
production of mediators of the systemic inflammatory response
syndrome [1]. Previous studies suggested an association of TNF
and LTA SNPs and the incidence of sepsis among ICU patients
[2-4]. By examining several candidate genes (TNF, PAI-1, IL-1,
IL-6), previously reported to be associated with sepsis outcome in
our cohort [5,6], we now report that genetic variation in TNF and/or
LTA is predictive for the development of sepsis in multiple trauma
patients with a low prevalence of other clinically confounding
factors.
Patients and methods One hundred and fifty-nine multiple trauma
patients were included prospectively following admission to the
ICU with an ISS of 12 points or more after complete assessment
of injuries. We genotyped all known SNPs including those in the 5′
region of the TNF gene, including LTA, with a reported allele
frequency of the rare allele of greater than 5% in Caucasians
(n = 9 SNPs). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic
regression analysis were performed.
Results Seventy-two patients (45.3%) fulfilled the criteria for sepsis
after severe trauma and 32 (38.9%) patients died from a sepsis
leading to MOF. Allele distributions were according to the HW
equilibrium. A significant association for the incidence of sepsis
after multiple trauma was observed for the TNF –308A allele (OR
7.14; 95% CI, 3.1–16.45; P < 0.0001), and the completely linked
LTA +252G allele (OR 1.96; 95% CI, 1.02–3.78; P < 0.042).
Additionally, both alleles showed significant association with death
after severe trauma (TNF –308A: OR 7.65; 95% CI, 13.27–17.93;
P < 0.0001; LTA +252G: OR 5.58; 95% CI, 2.02–15.44;
P < 0.0002).
Conclusion The presence of one or two copies of the TNF –308A,
LTA +252G haplotype is strongly predictive for the incidence of
sepsis and death in multiple trauma patients.

Introduction Severe trauma may be followed by an uncontrolled
inflammatory response that is associated with high mortality and
morbidity and the patient is at high risk of developing MOF [1].
Serial gene expression analysis of peripheral blood obtained from
patients with polytrauma should provide a molecular portrait of
mechanisms leading to sepsis. Genome-wide transcriptional
profiling will permit identification of novel predictive biomarkers for
earlier diagnosis of sepsis and MOF than current strategies using
serum markers and clinical scores.
Methods Whole blood Paxgene samples were collected at the
initial time point (TP 0) and then every 24 hours until day 28 post
hospital admission from 21 patients with multiple trauma. Ten
patients developed sepsis during the stay in the ICU while 11
remained nonseptic. Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood

of each patient at TP 0 and subjected to microarray analysis using
the CodeLink UniSet Human I Bioarray (Amersham Bioscience)
containing 9877 human genes. Data analysis was carried out using
ImaGene5 (Amersham Bioscience), dChip (www.dchip.org) and
SAM (www-stat.stanford.edu).
Results Multiple testing with a FDR of 1.1 [2] revealed in total 692
significantly regulated genes in septic patients at TP 0, of which
480 genes had significantly higher and 212 genes significantly
lower expression levels compared with nonseptic patients at TP 0.
The highly expressed genes were mainly involved in inflammatory
and stress responses, apoptosis and development, while the lower
expressed genes could be assigned to defense responses, protein
biosynthesis and lipid binding. Hierarchical clustering of the
samples clearly differentiated between the time point of admission
and sepsis.
Conclusion Statistical analysis of expression data enabled clear
differentiation between nonseptic and septic traumatic patients at
admission to the ICU (TP 0). Septic patients showed significant
overexpression of genes involved in immune responses and
antiapoptosis, indicating a strong inflammatory interaction at time
of admission as compared with nonseptic patients. The early
vigorous inflammatory response appears to activate a program,
subsequently leading to SIRS and, finally, MOF.

Prothrombin gene and factor V Leiden gene polymorphism
in patients with deep vein thrombosis: prevalence,
diagnostic and therapeutic implications
A Rizk1, A El Naggar1, I Saad2

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P147 (doi:10.1186/cc4494)
Risk profiling in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been classically
concerned with traditional factors of obesity, postoperative status,
prolonged recumbency, longstanding varicosity, etc., with
subsequent stagnation of blood and damage to vascular
endothelium. Only recently, there has been increasing concern
with procoagulant factors as protein C, protein S, antithrombin III
deficiencies as well as elevated factor VIII, hyperhomocysteinemia,
dysfibrinogenemia, etc., all of heredofamilial nature.
The present study is intended to assess the prevalence of two
genetic disorders promoting coagulation; namely, the mutant form
of factor V (Leiden) and the prothrombin gene in Egyptian patients
with acute DVT.
We studied 30 patients admitted with acute DVT (16 male, 14
female, mean age 44 ± 14 years), and 30 control subjects (19 males,
11 females, mean age 37 ± 10 years). Excluded from the study were
patients known to have bleeding diathesis, those with acute or
chronic liver disease, and those on oral or parenteral anticoagulation.
Following clinical evaluation including 12-lead ECG and routine
laboratory tests, all patients were subjected to venous duplex and
gene identification. The latter comprised DNA extraction, PCR
amplification, and gene mutation detection using the
THROMBOTYPE reagent kit.
Compared with control subjects, patients with acute DVT had
significantly higher prevalence of factor V Leiden Gene mutation
(66.7% vs 23.3%, P = 0.003). Compared with noncarriers of this
mutant form, carriers exhibited significantly more frequent familial
incidence (55% vs 15%, P = 0.035), younger age of presentation
(40 years vs 51 years, P = 0.048) and more frequent complications
(55% vs 10%, P = 0.049). Prothrombin gene mutation was
exhibited by three out of 30 patients with acute DVT (10%) and was
associated with factor V Leiden in two of them. None of the control
subjects exhibited this mutant form of the prothrombin gene.
In conclusion, acute DVT among young patients and particularly
those with recurrent DVT should urge the cardiologist to search for
factors promoting coagulation. Our data show abnormally high
prevalence of the mutant form of factor V Leiden (associated with
prothrombin gene mutation in a minority). Besides the diagnostic
value, gene mutation detection has therapeutic and prognostic
implications through the need to adjust the dose and the duration
of oral anticoagulation.

Inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase prevents the
attenuated response to noradrenaline during human
endotoxemia

Vasodilatory shock is the main cause of mortality during sepsis.
Animal experiments suggest that the decreased vasopressor
sensitivity present in vasodilatory shock is caused by increased
levels of nitric oxide (NO). Human data on this subject are sparse.
The administration of Escherichia coli endotoxin (LPS) to human
volunteers induces an inflammatory response and, as clinically
observed in sepsis, an attenuated vasoconstrictive response to nor-
adrenaline. The present study investigated the effects of NO
inhibitors L-NMMA and aminoguanidine on the attenuated vaso-
constrictive response to noradrenaline during human endotoxemia.
Thirteen human volunteers received 2 ng/kg E. coli LPS intra-
venously. The brachial artery was cannulated for infusion of
noradrenaline and L-NMMA. The response to noradrenaline was
determined by intra-arterial infusion (1–3–10–30 ng/min/dl) and
determination of forearm blood flow (FBF) using venous occlusion
plethysmography. The noradrenaline dose–response was deter-
mined before and 4 hours after LPS administration.
Group A (n = 6): to determine the local effect of NO inhibitor L-
NMMA on noradrenaline dose–response, a dose of 0.2 mg/min/dl
L-NMMA was infused intra-arterially at t = 5 hours after LPS
administration. During the infusion of L-NMMA the noradrenaline
dose–response was determined again.
Group B (n = 7): to assess the effect of systemic NO inhibition the
selective inducible NO synthase (iNOS) inhibitor aminoguanidine
was administrated i.v. at t = 1 hour post-LPS administration and
continued until t = 5 hours (370 mg loading dose and 60 mg/hour
continuously). Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. FBF is
expressed as the ratio of the flow in the infused/non-infused arm
and is presented in percentages compared with the baseline.
Differences were tested by repeated-measures ANOVA. P < 0.05
was considered to indicate significance.
LPS administration induced the expected flu-like symptoms, fever
(38.3 ± 0.1°C), and a decrease in mean arterial pressure and
increase in heart rate in both groups. The intrabrachial infusion of
L-NMMA increased noradrenaline sensitivity after endotoxin
administration (LPS alone 92 ± 5, 85 ± 4, 68 ± 11, 44 ± 13; LPS +
L-NMMA 71 ± 8, 66 ± 7, 48 ± 11, 21 ± 3%, P = 0.009). The
systemic inhibition of iNOS completely prevented the attenuated
response to noradrenaline at t = 4 hours (before LPS 83 ± 5,
76 ± 7, 58 ± 9, 31 ± 2; after LPS + aminoguanidine 89 ± 3,
82 ± 4, 57 ± 5, 34 ± 5%, P = NS).

The local administration of nonselective NO-inhibitor L-NMMA
restores the attenuated noradrenaline sensitivity during human
endotoxemia. Moreover, systemic iNOS inhibition by aminoguanidine
completely prevents an attenuated vasoconstrictor response. The
present study indicates that noradrenaline insensitivity during human
endotoxemia is mediated by induction of inducible NO synthase.

Objective In order to gain insight into the pathogenesis of
increased vascular permeability during sepsis, we studied the
effect of plasma obtained during human experimental endotoxemia
on the permeability of cultured endothelial monolayers in vitro.
Methods Eight healthy subjects received an i.v. dose of 2 ng/kg
Escherichia coli O:113 lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The concen-
tration of various plasma mediators that supposedly induce
vascular permeability was measured over time. Plasmas that were
obtained prior to and 2 and 4 hours after the administration of LPS
were added to human umbilical venular endothelial cells (HUVEC)
that were cultured on semipermeable membranes.
The permeability of the endothelial monolayers to FITC-labeled
bovine serum albumin was determined and expressed as the
relative concentration of FITC-BSA when compared with that
measured across empty Transwell-COL membranes (i.e. without
endothelial monolayers). The permeability levels were correlated
with the plasma concentrations of various mediators.
Results Experimental endotoxemia resulted in elevated levels of
TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and VEGF, and a moderate increase
of IL-12 and IFN-γ (all P < 0.01). Incubation of HUVEC with plasma
obtained 2 and 4 hours after the administration of LPS increased
the relative permeability from a baseline level of (median [range])
17% [14–31%] to 23% ([12–39%], P = NS) and 28% ([11–40%],
P < 0.05), respectively. Plasma levels of VEGF and IL-10, but not
TNF-α, or any of the other mediators, significantly correlated with
the increase in endothelial permeability (r = 0.47, P = 0.038 and
r = 0.43, P = 0.038, respectively).
Conclusion The data presented here demonstrate that plasmas
obtained from experimental human endotoxemia increase
endothelial permeability in vitro. This response was independent of
the incubation time (45 min–6 hours) of endotoxic plasma on the
endothelial monolayers. The increase in endothelial permeability
was moderately correlated with VEGF and IL-10 levels in plasma.
Our observations may facilitate future experiments that try to
elucidate the pathophysiology of increased vascular permeability
during systemic inflammation.

Introduction We showed recently that both selective iNOS
inhibition and the radical scavenger Tempol prevented live bacteria
from causing key features of hemodynamic, microcirculatory and
metabolic derangements in porcine sepsis [1,2]. Here we
investigated the effects of combined selective iNOS inhibition
(L-NIL) with a free radical scavenger (Tempol) on P. aeruginosa-
induced endothelial and hemostatic stress.
Methods Twelve hours after induction of sepsis with continuous
i.v. P. aeruginosa, 16 pigs received either no drug (CONT, n = 8)
or a combination of L-NIL + Tempol (COMB, n = 8). Before and
12, 18 and 24 hours after the start of P. aeruginosa, plasma levels
of markers related to endothelial function (von Willebrand factor
[vWf]), hypercoagulability (thrombin–antithrombin complexes
[TAT]), oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) and inflammation (TNF-α)
were assessed.
Results See Table 1. Combined treatment prevented a sepsis-
induced increase in plasma 8-isoprostane and substantially
attenuated the gradual increase in TNF-α.

were markedly attenuated by the combined iNOS blockade and
radical scavenging. Suppression of oxidative stress and excessive
inflammation might contribute to these results.

remains unclear. Furthermore, its use is not currently recommended.
Objective To evaluate the effect of polyclonal intravenous immuno-
globulin therapy on mortality in critically ill adult patients with sepsis.
Data sources Medline (1966–September 2005) and the
Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (September 2005).
Study selection All randomized controlled trials of polyclonal
intravenous immunoglobulin therapy with a placebo comparison or
no intervention during the course of sepsis, severe sepsis or septic
shock in critically ill adult patients. No restriction was made for

Data extraction Data were independently extracted by two
investigators using a standardized form.
Data synthesis The literature search identified 4462 articles, of
which 32 were deemed potentially eligible. Nineteen trials
(n = 2415) met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis.
Polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was associated
with an overall survival benefit (risk ratio [RR] = 0.72, 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.59–0.88) compared with placebo or no
intervention. The number needed to treat was 10 [95% CI: 4–16].
In sensitivity analyses, we documented improved survival when the
analysis was limited to published and peer-reviewed trials
(RR = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.55–0.87) (16 trials, n = 1659) and blinded
trials (RR = 0.61, 95% CI, 0.40–0.93) (seven trials, n = 896). A
dosage regimen higher than 1 g/kg and a duration of therapy
longer than 2 days were strongly associated with this survival
benefit.
Conclusions We observed a survival benefit with the use of
polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in sepsis compared
with placebo or no intervention. The magnitude of the benefit is
advantageously comparable with activated protein C. Because of
methodological limitations of the current literature, a large
randomized controlled trial of this therapy is recommended.

Introduction Lymphocyte apoptosis has been identified as an
important factor contributing to both the onset of sepsis and to the
progression into septic shock and multiple organ failure. Anti-
apoptotic therapy through caspase inhibition therefore offers a novel
and promising approach to the treatment or prevention of sepsis.
Significantly, administration of caspase inhibitors has already been
shown to be beneficial in animal models of the disease. We have
designed VX-166, a novel broad caspase inhibitor that has an
advantageous pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile and should be
suitable for use in man. The present study was performed to evaluate
VX-166 as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of sepsis.
Methods and results VX-166 demonstrated extremely potent anti-
apoptotic activity in a variety of cell assays using a number of
different apoptotic stimuli. In vivo, VX-166 was tested in a murine
model of endotoxic shock and a rat caecal ligation and puncture
model (CLP) of peritoneal sepsis. In the first model, male CD-1
mice (n = 28 per group) were administered lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) (20 mg/kg i.v.) and their survival monitored for 96 hours.
VX-166 administered by repeat i.v. bolus (0, 4, 8 and 12 hours
post-LPS) dramatically improved survival in a dose-dependent
fashion (P < 0.0001). This result was confirmed in a second study
where the optimal dose (30 mg/kg) of VX-166 substantially
improved survival from 0% in the vehicle group to 75% in the
VX-166 group (P < 0.0001). In the second model, adult male
Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 12 per group) underwent CLP. Their
necrotic caecum was excised 20 hours later and survival was
monitored over 10 days. Continuous administration of VX-166 by
mini-osmotic pump immediately following surgery improved survival
(P < 0.01) from 38% in the control group to 88% in the
compound-treated group. Mode of action studies in this model
confirmed that VX-166 reduced thymic atrophy and lymphocyte
apoptosis (P < 0.01). This is good evidence of the anti-apoptotic
activity of the compound in vivo. In addition, plasma endotoxin
levels were reduced (P < 0.05), strongly suggesting that VX-166
can improve clearance of bacteria from the bloodstream in sepsis.
Most importantly, we demonstrated that VX-166 fully retained its
efficacy when dosed 3 hours after insult (P < 0.01), by improving
survival from 42% in the control group to 92% in the dosed group.
Conclusion These results show that VX-166 substantially
improves survival in experimental sepsis. As VX-166 also has an
excellent toxicity profile and pharmacokinetic properties that make
it suitable for use in man, we believe that VX-166 represents an
exciting opportunity as an anti-apoptotic therapy for the prevention
and treatment of sepsis.

TAK-242, a novel Toll-like receptor 4 signal transduction
inhibitor, protects mice in Escherichia coli-induced and
lipoteichoic acid-induced lethality models

Objectives Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern recognition
receptor of various host and bacterial ligands. TLR4 ligands such
as lipopolysaccharide activate immune cells and induce production
of many cytokines, which are involved in the onset of sepsis. TAK-
242 is a novel small molecule that selectively inhibits TLR4-
induced production of multiple cytokines by monocytes and
macrophages. The in-vivo potential of TAK-242 was examined in
models of Escherichia coli (Gram-negative)-induced and lipo-
teichoic acid (LTA) (Gram-positive)-induced lethality in mice.
Methods E. coli was inoculated intraperitoneally in Bacillus calmette
guerin-primed mice. One hour after bacterial inoculation, TAK-242
was intravenously administered with antibiotics. LTA-induced lethality
was induced by the intraperitoneal administration of LTA and D-
galactosamine. Cytokine levels in sera were determined by specific
ELISAs and survival through 7 days was recorded.
Results TAK-242 coadministered with ceftazidime (CAZ) dose-
dependently protected mice from E. coli-induced lethality; CAZ
alone was ineffectual. Statistically significant protection was
observed at 0.3 mg/kg or more of TAK-242 (n = 10, P ≤ 0.05) and
3 mg/kg prevented lethality in all mice. The increases in serum
levels of not only proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and
IL-1β, but also an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, were
significantly and dose-dependently suppressed by TAK-242.
Increase cytokine levels were quickly and markedly suppressed by
the treatment with TAK-242 even when cytokine levels had already
increased significantly. The doses that prevented lethality and
inhibited cytokine production were similar, suggesting that
TAK-242 rescued mice by suppressing excessive cytokine
production and inflammation. TAK-242 did not increase bacterial
counts in blood, although it suppressed cytokine production.
TAK-242 showed similar protective effects when the antibiotics
imipenem or gentamicin were used in place of CAZ, suggesting
TAK-242 would work in combination with various types of
antibiotics. In addition, TAK-242 dose-dependently suppressed the
LTA-induced increase in serum IL-6 levels in mice and rescued
mice from death. Statistically significant protection was observed
at 0.3 mg/kg or more of TAK-242 (n = 10, P ≤ 0.05) and 3 mg/kg
rescued all mice. The efficacy in the LTA model was, therefore,
comparable with that in the E. coli model.

therapeutic treatment for sepsis. A pivotal clinical trial of TAK-242
to test this hypothesis is ongoing.

Objectives Sepsis is a clinical syndrome whose pathophysiology
reflects the activation of an innate host response to infection. Toll-like
receptors (TLRs) recognize structural components of various
microbes and activate inflammatory signaling. TLR4 detects Gram-
negative bacteria through recognition of the lipid A moiety of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The cyclohexene derivative TAK-242
inhibits multiple inflammatory mediators produced by LPS-stimulated
murine RAW264.7 macrophages. We determined the selectivity of
TAK-242 against the TLR family and its efficacy in vitro and in vivo.
Methods The selectivity of TAK-242 against the TLR family was
examined in a NF-κB reporter gene assay using 293 cells
transfected with human TLR expression vectors. The amount of
nitric oxide (NO) in the medium was determined by measuring the
fluorescence of 2,3-diaminonaphthalene; cytokine levels in the
medium and activation of the signal pathway of TLR4 were
examined by BioPlex cytokine and phosphoprotein panel assay
systems. To evaluate the efficacy and selectivity of TAK-242 in
vivo, cytokine levels in sera of mice injected intraperitoneally with
LPS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), or peptidoglycan (PGN) (10 mg/kg
each) were measured by ELISA. TAK-242 was administered
intravenously 1 hour before the challenge.
Results TAK-242 almost completely inhibited production of NO
and cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-6) in LPS-stimulated
RAW264.7 cells; the IC50 for LPS-induced NO production was
7.0 nmol/l. The LPS-induced activation of IkB kinase (IKK), p38,
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) pathways were also markedly inhibited by TAK-242,
but it showed little effect on NO production induced by
Pam3CSK4 (TLR1/2), PGN (TLR6/2), double-strand RNA (TLR3),
or CpG oligonucleotide (TLR9). The NF-κB reporter gene assay
showed that LPS-induced TLR4 activation was inhibited by
TAK-242 in 293 cells transiently expressing TLR4 and the TLR4
co-receptors MD2 and CD14. TAK-242 also inhibited LPS-
independent NF-κB activation resulting from overexpression of
TLR4, but showed little effect on NF-κB activation by other TLRs
(TLR1/2, TLR6/2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9). TLR4 selectivity
was also observed in vivo. Intravenous administration of TAK-242
to mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg inhibited the increase in serum IL-6
levels induced by TLR4 ligands LPS or LTA, but not by the TLR6/2
ligand PGN even at a dose of 10 mg/kg.
Conclusion TAK-242 is a potent and selective inhibitor of TLR4
signaling in vitro and in vivo, and therefore represents a novel
therapeutic approach to the treatment of sepsis.

Tifacogin increases bacterial clearance from blood
S Hardy, S Schirm, X Liu, Y Dai
Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P155 (doi:10.1186/cc4502)
Multiple animal studies show that tifacogin (rTFPI; Chiron Corp.)
improves survival when administered after lethal challenge with
bacteria. Since some anticoagulant agents fail to rescue
challenged animals, this effect of tifacogin may be due to
mechanisms beyond anticoagulant activity. Other data relevant to
tifacogin action include: IL-6 levels decrease in tifacogin-treated
animals, infused tifacogin circulates as fragments, domains
essential for anticoagulation are confined to TFPI’s N-terminus, the
C-terminus of tifacogin binds to LPS and, in a preliminary
experiment, we found that a tifacogin peptide (amino acids
255–276) inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-α production. We
hypothesize that tifacogin’s C-terminus acts on the innate immune
system to promote bacterial clearance. To test this we mixed C-
terminal tifacogin peptides with whole blood inoculated with
opsonization-resistant bacteria (Escherichia coli 018:K1:H7 or a
clinical isolate of coagulase-negative Staphylococci ATCC
700583), and then assessed bacteria growth. Controls were: a
scrambled peptide from tifacogin’s C-terminus or cultures without
fragments. Both controls supported vigorous bacterial growth.
Peptide 255-276 almost eradicated E. coli at 3 µM but not at
300 nM. Peptide 242–268 eliminated most bacteria at 3 µM and
300 nM, and in separate experiments inhibited growth by 90% at
10–30 nM. This region of tifacogin is also associated with heparin
binding. Not surprisingly, 3 U/ml heparin completely antagonized
peptide 242–268’s activity. Unlike the bactericidal peptide LL37,
peptide 242–268 was unable to clear bacteria in the absence of
whole blood. This suggests that tifacogin interacts with a blood
component, such as cellular mediators of immunity. Similar results
were obtained with Staphylococci. The finding that tifacogin has
bacterial clearance activity in addition to its anticoagulant activity is
additional support for the rationale underlying Chiron’s ongoing
phase III study of tifacogin in patients with severe community-
acquired pneumonia.

Background Endothelial cell dysfunction may be implicated in the
development of multiple organ failure (MOF) by a number of
mechanisms. Among these, altered plasma fibrinolysis promotes
fibrin deposition, which may create microvascular alterations.

Previously, we observed that critically ill patients were
characterized by a more marked red blood cell membrane and
transferrin desialylation (sialic acid removed) [1,2] in septic
patients. Sialic acid (SA), due to its negative charge, is involved in
diverse cell–cell, cell–molecule and molecule–molecule inter-
actions. We aimed to test the effect of endothelial cell membrane
desialylation on the complete fibrinolysis process (coagulation and
fibrinolysis) at the surface of endothelial cells in vitro.
Methods The endothelial cell line Ea.hy926 was used. The cells
were inoculated on polyethylene terephtalate (PET) microporous
membrane, in glass circular microcuvettes (51 mm2) and grown for
6 days until confluence in DMEM with 10% FBS. The cell were
incubated for 20 min in medium containing 0.5 U, 1 U and 2 U
neuraminidase. To study the fibrinolysis process, a euglobulin fraction
(a plasma fraction) was placed on the cell surface, and the clotting
was induced by thrombin addition. The lysis time was measured in
a newly designed apparatus and expressed in minutes [3].
Results The results are expressed as the ratio of the lysis time of
treated cells to control cells. Neuraminidase treatment (1 U and
2 U) induced a 0.79-fold and 0.83-fold decrease in lysis time
(ANOVA; n = 6: P < 0.001). This indicates an increase of fibrino-
lytic activity.
Conclusions In this work, we show the importance of SA in
fibrinolytic activity of endothelial cell membranes. This mechanism
could protect the endothelium from the fibrin deposition. The fact
that desialylation occurs in the bloodstream from septic patients
could also impair the endothelium function. Studies are needed to
determine the possible desialylation of endothelial cells in sepsis
and the implications of this mechanism in the physiopathology of
sepsis.

Altered coagulation in systemic inflammatory response
syndrome: role of protein C in diagnosis and prognosis
A Rizk, A El Naggar, M Affify, S Mokhtar
Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P157 (doi:10.1186/cc4504)
Background Evidence has accumulated to suggest that more
complex mechanisms might be involved in the relationship between
inflammation and coagulation.
Objective In this study we aimed to use some coagulation
markers, especially activated protein C (APC), in the diagnosis and
prognosis of patients with systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRs), whether infectious or non-infectious.
Methods We enrolled 20 patients who had been hospitalized for
SIRs as well as 20 age-matched and sex-matched subjects who
served as the control group. All patients and control groups were
subjected to full clinical evaluation with application of APACHE II
scoring, routine laboratory investigations as well as specific
investigations, namely; plasma levels of protein C, D-dimer (DD),
antithrombin III (ATIII), and thrombin–antithrombin complex (TAT)
upon admission, 48 and 96 hours later and on discharge in
survivors.
Results The study showed that APC levels were significantly lower
in patients with SIRS compared with control subjects (38.6 ± 23%
vs 87.8 ± 6.1% P < 0.0001) respectively. When we compared
levels in survivors and nonsurvivors, the former showed a
persistent rise of the level to normal values in contrast to the latter,
in which the levels were persistently low (34.8 ± 26% vs 40.6 ±
22% on admission and 82 ± 13% vs 41 ± 21%, P < 0.01 after
144 hours), respectively. Patients with septic shock also showed
significantly lower levels of APC compared with those without
shock (28.8 ± 12% vs 56.8 ± 28% P < 0.007 on admission and
41.7 ± 21.8% vs 82 ± 13% after 144 hours, P < 0.001),
respectively. APC levels also were lower in patients with
multiorgan failure syndrome (MODS) as compared with those
without MODS (40.8 ± 27.8% vs 116 ± 29%, P < 0.01),
respectively, with a statistically insignificant lower level in patients
with APACHE score >20 as compared with those with APACHE
score <20 (35.2 ± 22% vs 45 ± 24%, P = NS). The other
coagulopathy markers of sepsis, DD, ATIII, TAT complex, did not
show any significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors
(2 ± 3.6 ng/ml vs 4.9 ± 8 ng/ml for DD, 40.75 ± 17.6% vs
40 ± 15.7% for AT III and 24.7 ± 25 µg/ml vs 22 ± 19 µg/ml for
TAT, P = NS), respectively.
Conclusion The protein C level is a useful biological marker in
patients with SIRS for both diagnostic and prognostic aspects
regarding MODS, septic shock and mortality, and also it is superior
to other coagulopathy markers for determining the ultimate clinical
outcome. In the view of our study results, we recommend
monitoring APC levels in patients with SIRS as early as possible to
screen those with sepsis syndrome to target aggressive therapy for
them

Introduction There is increasing evidence for acute traumatic
coagulopathy occurring prior to emergency room (ER) admission
but detailed information is still insufficient.
Objective To evaluate the frequency of traumatic coagulopathy on
ER admission in patients with multiple injury.
Methods Retrospective analysis using the German Trauma
Registry database including 17,200 multiple injured patients to
determine to what extent clinically relevant coagulopathy has
already been established upon ER admission, and whether its
presence was associated with impaired outcome and mortality.
Results A total of 8724 patients with complete data sets were
screened. Coagulopathy upon ER admission was present in 2989
(34.2%) of all patients. Males were more affected than females
(72.5% vs 27.5%) and in 96% the trauma mechanism was blunt.
The mean ISS score in the coagulopathy group was 30 ± 15, while
trauma patients without coagulopathy upon ER admission
generally presented with lower ISS scores (mean ISS 21 ± 12;
P < 0.001). Twenty-nine percent of patients with coagulopathy
developed multiorgan failure (P < 0.001). Early inhospital mortality
(<24 hours) was 13% in patients with coagulopathy (P < 0.001)
and overall inhospital mortality totalled 28% (P < 0.001).
Conclusion There is a high frequency of established coagulopathy
in multiply injury upon ER admission. The presence of early
traumatic coagulopathy was associated with injury severity and
impaired outcome.

We recently demonstrated that antithrombin (AT) reduces
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced liver injury in rats by increasing
hepatic tissue levels of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a
neuropeptide released from the sensory nerve endings. In the
present study, we examined the effect of AT on I/R-induced liver
injury in wildtype mice (CGRP+/+) and congenital α CGRP-
deficient mice (CGRP–/–). We further investigated whether AT
affects CGRP release from dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG)
isolated from CGRP+/+. Based on results obtained in the present
study, we attempted to determine whether the anti-inflammatory
activity of AT in vivo is dependent mainly on sensory neuron
activation. AT enhanced I/R-induced increases in hepatic tissue
levels of CGRP and 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable metabolite of PGI2, in
CGRP+/+, while it did not enhance these increases in CGRP–/–. AT
inhibited reperfusion-induced increases in serum alanine amino-
transferase levels by increasing hepatic tissue blood flow and by
attenuating increases in hepatic levels of tumor necrosis factor and
myeloperoxidase in CGRP+/+, while it showed neither of these
therapeutic effects in CGRP–/–. AT increased CGRP release from
cultured DRGs only in the presence of anandamide, and the AT-
induced increase in CGRP release was not observed in the
presence of KT5720, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA). AT
markedly increased intracellular levels of cAMP in the presence of
anandamide. In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that AT
might reduce I/R-induced liver injury by enhancing activation of the
sensory neurons through activation of PKA in sensory neurons.

Comparison of the effects of tranexamic acid, aprotinin
and placebo on blood conservation, fibrinolysis and
platelet function with extensive heart surgery

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P160 (doi:10.1186/cc4507)
Introduction CPB results in fibrinolysis as reflected by increased
plasmin concentrations and fibrin degradation products, both of
which have deleterious effects on platelet function. We designed a
study to compare the effects of a high dose of aprotinin (A),
tranexamic acid (TA) and no treatment (P) on blood loss, trans-
fusion of blood products, fibrinolysis and platelet function during
and after heart surgery.
Methods After IRB approval, 60 consecutive consenting patients
undergoing combined aortic valve replacement surgery with
CABG were studied. They were randomized to either: high-dose A
(280 mg loading dose, 70 mg/hour infusion rate and 280 mg in the
prime) (n = 20), TA (100 mg/kg loading dose, 1 mg/kg/hour
infusion rate) (n = 20), or saline (n = 20). The effect of A and TA
on some markers for the activation of thrombin formation and
fibrinolysis was studied (D-dimer, plasminogen, α2-anti-plasmin,
antithrombin and glycocalicin, a fragment of the platelet-membrane
GPIb). Sampling was at induction (t1), at the start and end of CPB
(t2, t3), and at 1, 4 and 24 hours after CPB (t4, t5,t 6). ANOVA for
repeated measurements was applied for statistical comparisons
between groups. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are
expressed as mean values ± SEM.
Results Study groups did not differ with regard to demographic
data and type of operation. Blood loss and chest tube drainage
was significantly less in the A and TA groups as compared with the
P group at all time points and was accompanied with the use of
less blood products, volume replacement and higher hemoglobin
levels. The duration of the surgical post-CPB period was
significantly shorter in the A and TA groups (55 ± 18, 71 ± 19 and
84 ± 26 min, respectively). There was no difference in platelet
count between groups. There were no re-explorations for
postoperative bleeding. Inhibition of fibrinolysis was significant with
both antifibrinolytic drugs (D-dimers 578 ± 81, 550 ± 105 and
3603 ± 440 µg/ml at t4). During and after the operation, the D-
dimers were much higher in the placebo group. α2-antiplasmin
levels were higher in the A group compared with the TA and P
groups. This effect was present until 24 hours after CPB. TA had
no effect on this parameter. Plasminogen levels were lower in the
TA group at t4, t5 and t6. TA patients more often received
additional boluses of heparin to maintain ACT > 480 s during
bypass (15/20 patients versus 9/20 and 8/20 patients in the A
and P groups, respectively). aPTT values were significantly
prolonged at the end of CPB in the A group. Antithrombin values
were significantly higher in the A group at t3, t4 and t5. Glyco-
calicin values were slightly higher in the TA group during bypass.
Discussion TA can inhibit fibrinolytic activity by blocking
plasmin(ogen) activity measured as the D-dimer level, but seems to
have no influence on neutralization of plasmin by α2-antiplasmin.
Both A and TA effectively suppress the appearance of markers of
fibrinolysis as compared with placebo. The results also suggest
that the antifibrinolytic effects of TA and A can reduce blood loss in
patients undergoing extensive CPB surgery.

Introduction Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are
frequently used for thrombosis prophylaxis or anticoagulation
treatment in critically ill patients without efficacy control in specific
patient groups.
Objective To evaluate the efficacy of sodium enoxaparin in
critically ill patients and the acute decompensation of baseline
conditions.
Method We evaluated critically ill patients admitted to a cardiology
critical care unit with indications of anticoagulation, either
prophylactic or therapeutic. Patients with body weight >110 kg or
serum creatinine ≥2.5mg/dl were excluded. Anthropometrics,
clinical data and the prognostic index were recorded. Anti-Xa
factor was titrated in three different moments: baseline (before
enoxaparin administration), and T1 (first or second day) and T2

(fifth to seventh day) after use of enoxaparin, 40 mg/day for
prophylaxis and 1 mg/kg every 12 hours for anticoagulation
therapy. Lower limb sonography was performed to scan for deep
vein thrombosis (DVT) in the prophylactic group of patients.
Results Thirty-two patients were included (16 patients in the
prophylactic group and 16 patients in the therapeutic group).
Mean age was 62 ± 16 years (from 20 to 92 years). The main
diagnosis included cardiogenic shock (10 patients), decompen-
sated cardiac failure (five patients), arrhythmia (six patients),
pulmonary embolism (two patients), lung infection (three infections),
prosthetic valve dysfunction (one patient) and others (five patients).
The mean APACHE II score was 10.9 ± 5. The T1 mean anti-Xa
factor titration for the prophylactic group was 0.35 ± 0.10 IU/ml
and for the therapeutic group was 0.57 ± 0.10 IU/ml (Mann–
Whitney test, P < 0.001). The T2 mean anti-Xa factor titration for
the prophylactic group was 0.46 ± 0.11 IU/ml and for the
therapeutic group was 0.69 ± 0.08 IU/ml (Mann–Whitney test,
P < 0.001). One patient presented with DVT in spite of proper anti-
Xa factor levels for prophylaxis.
Conclusions Sodium enoxaparin in the used schedules was
effective. Anti-Xa factor titration is useful in monitoring critically ill
patients, especially those with low cardiac output.

Objective To monitor hemocoagulation in patients with systemic
inflammation while continually i.v. administering LMWH, plus
dosage adjustment, while trying to reflect on coagulation changes,
mainly regarding the values of anti-Xa and Ddim.
Background LMWH is used in the prophylaxis of as well as
therapy of DVT, in the prevention of thrombus formation in extra-
corporal circulation through CRRT, in the therapy of unstable
angina pectoris and non-Q myocardial infarction, and in the therapy
of stroke. We have asked ourselves the question of whether the
same administration routine could be applied in critically ill patients
where we assume a pronounced prothrombotic state. Critically ill
patients commonly demonstrate hyperfibrinogenemy, reactive
thromobocytosis, and changes of the plasmatic coagulation
system. Due to the favourable therapeutic potential of LMWH, we
decided on a continual i.v. administration of enoxaparin as well as
hemocoagulation monitoring.
Materials and methods The study included patients with an
expected length of stay >48 hours and with no contraindication to
anticoagulation therapy. We monitored the coagulation parameters
INR, aPTT, TT, FBG, AT, Ddim, PLT count, leukocyte count, anti-
Xa, vWfF level, PLT activation, and the dosage of LMWH within the
past 24 hours. The patients were divided into two groups: with
SOFA <5 and with SOFA≥5. The initial daily dose of LMWH was
administered based on the patient’s weight. Dose modifications
were carried out so that the anti-Xa level would be between 0.2
and 0.5 IU/ml and/or the Ddim count would demonstrate a steady
(in the standard levels) or falling (in elevated levels) tendency. Flow
cytometry was used for quantification of blood cells carrying the
CD61 antigen (i.e. platelet identification), out of which those that
carried CD62 antigen on the surface were selected (i.e. activated
platelets).
Results Preliminary evaluation includes 10 patients, 109 sets of
measuring. The average dose of LMWH was 490 IU anti-Xa/
24 hours (8.05 IU anti-Xa/kg/24 hours, respectively). The average
value of anti-Xa was 0.21 IU/ml. The average value of activated
PLT was 53.16%, within the 16–97% range. The increased activity
of the coagulation system as well as the endothelium (the level of
vWF reached 482% on average, within the 185–825% range)
correlated (P = 0.001) with the intensity of systemic inflammation
(CRP, leucocytes), especially in patients with SOFA score ≥5.
Conclusion Monitoring vWF levels and the number of activated
platelets indicates a prothrombotic potential of the hemocoagula-
tion system in critically ill patients. The established methods of
administering LMWH quite probably do not correspond with the
prothrombotic activation of the coagulation system in these
patients. As it turns out, it will be necessary to carry out much more
research.

Solvent-detergent plasma: use in neonatal patients, in
adult and paediatric patients with liver disease and in
obstetric and gynaecological emergencies
V Chekrizova, W Murphy
Irish Blood Transfusion Service, Dublin, Ireland
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P163 (doi:10.1186/cc4510)
We assessed the efficacy and tolerance of solvent-detergent (SD)
plasma in neonates, in obstetric and gynaecological patients, and
in patients with liver disease in three large hospitals in Dublin over
an 18-month period.
Forty-one neonates received 67 transfusions of SD plasma at a
mean dose ± standard deviation of 18.4 ± 3.2 ml/kg. Thirty-eight
obstetric and gynaecological patients received 57 SD plasma
transfusions at a mean dose of 15.3 ± 7.7 ml/kg. Thirty-six women
(94.7%) had haemorrhage with mean blood loss per patient of
3345.8 ± 2738.1 ml. Fifteen children with liver disease received
33 SD plasma transfusions at a mean volume of 38.0 ± 41.5 ml/kg
body weight. Seventeen adult patients with severe end-stage liver
disease were transfused with SD plasma either following liver
transplantation or prior to other invasive procedures, at a mean
dose of 10.2 ± 3.4 ml/kg.
There were statistically significant decreases in APTT and PT in
neonates, in obstetric and gynaecological patients, and in patients
with liver disease. Pre-transfusion and post-transfusion APTT was
measured in 40/67 neonatal transfusion episodes, PT in 43/67,
fibrinogen in 39/67, and platelets in 49/67. After plasma infusion
the mean APTT improved from 68.9 ± 37.4 s to 44.0 ± 15.6 s (t =
4.79; P < 0.001); PT from 28.7 ± 20.3 s to 20.7 ± 14.2 s (t =
2.64; P < 0.02); fibrinogen from 1.94 ± 1.1 g/l to 2.51 ± 1.14 g/l
(t = 3.41; P < 0.002). Pre-transfusion and post-transfusion APTT
was measured in 41/57 transfusions in the obstetric/gynaecology
group; PT and fibrinogen in 42/57. The mean APTT improved from
50.1 ± 18.4 s to 32.7 ± 6.9 s (t = 6.40; P < 0.001); PT from
21.0 ± 5.2 s to 15.6 ± 1.9 s (t = 7.71; P < 0.001); fibrinogen from
1.55 ± 0.75 g/l to 2.74 ± 0.86 g/l (t = 9.15; P < 0.001). Pre-
transfusion and post-transfusion APTT, PT and platelets were
measured in 22/33 transfusion episodes in the group of children
with liver disease, and fibrinogen in 13/33. The APTT decreased
from 61.5 ± 33.0 s to 47.8 ± 12.5 s (t = 5.15, P < 0.001) and the
PT from 24.4 ± 10.0 s to 19.9 ± 4.2 s (t = 5.05, P < 0.001).
Fibrinogen improved from 1.46 ± 0.75 g/l to 1.66 ± 0.59 g/l (t =
1.25; P > 0.05). In the group of adult patients with severe end-
stage liver disease, precoagulation and postcoagulation test
results were available for 14 of 17 transfusion episodes. There was
a statistically significant improvement in the PT from 23.2 ± 4.9 s

to 18.6 ± 2.9 s (t = 4.46, P < 0.001) and in the APTT from
45.1 ± 8.9 s to 36.4 ± 7.1 s (t = 3.95, P < 0.002).
No adverse reactions were observed for SD plasma infusion.
Use of SD plasma in critically ill neonates, in women with obstetric
and gynaecological emergencies, and in patients with liver disease
appears safe, and improves laboratory indices of coagulopathy.

Two years experience with low-dose recombined activated
factor VII treatment of non-haemophilic patients
G Michalska, R Ratajski
Clinical Hospital No. 2, Szczecin, Poland
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P164 (doi:10.1186/cc4511)
Background Recombined activated factor VII (rFVIIa) (NovoSeven®;
Novo Nordrisk) is a relatively new drug, which gives new opportunity
in the treatment of patients with severe bleeding. The severe
bleeding in haemophilic patients was the first indication for which
rFVIIa was registered, but nowadays this drug is becoming more
popular also in treatment of severe bleedings of other origins.
Objective The aim of this research was to evaluate the
effectiveness of rFVIIa in treatment of severely bleeding patients in
the ICU.
Methods Retrospective analysis of 24 patient who received rFVIIa
in our ICU between January 2001 and October 2005. We used
the questionnaires of Novo Nordrisk to assess the indications and
effectiveness of treatment. We compared the amount of blood lost
within 12 hours before and within 12 hours after giving rFVIIa, and
the dynamics of bleeding (assessed in ml/hours) before and after
treatment.
Results In the aforementioned period of time rFVIIa was used 28
times in our ICU in treatment of 24 patients (four patients received
two doses) with severe bleeding, none of whom was suffering
haemophilia. The average patient age was 49.5 years (range
24–77), and average body mass was 70.4 kg (range 55–120).
The following diseases were diagnosed: cancer – six patients (liver
cancer, two patients; ovarian cancer, two patients; prostate, one
patient; kidney, one patient), post-abdominal surgery bleeding –
four patients, ruptured abdominal aorta aneurysms – three patients,
sepsis – three patients, acute pancreatitis – two patients, post-
kidney transplant complications – two patients, postpartum
bleeding – two patients, GI bleeding – two patients. One of the
mentioned patients with sepsis was a lady treated with
drotreocogin (Xigris, Lilly) infusion. The average dose of rFVIIa was
22.53 µg/kg (range 10–56). The average blood loss within
12 hours before treatment was 2728 ml and the average blood
loss within 12 hours after treatment was 184 ml. The average
dynamics of bleeding before treatment was 1163 ml/hours versus
184 ml/hours after treatment. The differences between the volume
of blood lost and dynamics of bleeding after and before treatment
were statistically significant.
Conclusion Our 4-year experience with rFVIIa makes us convinced
that this drug is very useful in treatment of severely bleeding
patients. It seems reasonable to start treatment with relatively low
doses, which are very often efficient enough to stop bleeding, and
the costs of such therapy are not so high as with higher doses.

Efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII in the
management of severe hemorrhage following cardiac surgery

Introduction Severe bleeding after cardiac surgery is often difficult
to manage. The efficacy of traditional drugs vary, which is why it is
necessary to use newer agents for beneficial control and
prevention of massive bleeding. The aim of this study is clinical
evaluation of the efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII
(rFVIIa) in the treatment of bleeding during and after cardiac
surgery by stimulation of clot formation at the site of injury.
Patients and methods rFVIIa (NovoSeven®; Novo Nordisk,
Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was used in 37 adult patients aged between
49 and 68 years who underwent open heart surgery (10 patients
coronary surgery, five patients valvular surgery, six patients surgery
of congenital heart defects, three patients surgery of dilated
cardiomyopathy) or surgery for aortic aneurisms (13 patients) in
2002–2005. All patients had normal coagulation parameters
before surgery. In these patients, bleeding (10–20 ml/min) has
developed intraoperatively or postoperatively. In 21 patients the
bleeding started after surgery intraoperatively, and in 16 patients
severe hemorrhage developed in the postoperative period.
Treatment of bleeding included infusions of fresh frozen plasma,
platelet concentrate, aprotinin and µ-aminocaproic acid. Two
patients underwent surgical re-exploration for bleeding. However
pharmacological and surgical management failed to stop the
hemorrhage. Prior to administration of rFVIIa, blood loss reached
2.5–3 l in some patients. rFVIIa was administered in doses of
60–90 µg/kg body weight. We used Student’s t test for statistical
analysis the laboratory data prior to and after rFVIIa.
Results After administration of the first median dose
(75.3 ± 10.1 µg) rFVIIa bleeding stopped in 27 patients (74%),
and markedly decreased in four patients during 1 hour. Six patients
who did not benefit from initial rFVIIa administration received
additional drug in doses of 70–90 µg/kg, with good results in four
patients. (Five patients received one additional dose, one patient
received four doses.)

There was considerable reduction in the need for replacement
therapy after rFVIIa administration. Analysis of laboratory data
(Table 1) revealed a significant decrease of prothrombin time after
30 min and improvement of platelet function after 3 hours of rFVIIa
administration. There were no significant differences in the
dynamics of other parameters of hemostasis. Adverse events have
not been seen after drug injection.
Conclusion These results suggest that rFVIIa has high efficacy in
treatment of massive hemorrhage and reducing the need for
hemotransfusions when other hemostatic therapy has failed.

Experience of NovoSeven administration in management
of coagulopathic bleedings after surgical interventions
with extracorporeal circulation

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P166 (doi:10.1186/cc4513)
Objective To analyze the clinical experience of administration of
recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) (NovoSeven) in post-
surgical bleedings refractory to the traditional haemostatic therapy
in patients who underwent surgical interventions with extra-
corporeal circulation (EC).
Materials and methods Assessment of 17 patients (age 31–53,
44.3 ± 2.9 years) who underwent surgical interventions on the
heart with EC (prosthetic repair of one or two heart valves,
coronary artery bypass graft, prosthetic repair of the ascending
aorta with a valvular conduit, etc.) was performed. Duration of EC
was 172 ± 34 min. The aorta was occluded for 107 ± 19 min.
Indications for administration of the rFVIIa were considered when
there was a postsurgical bleeding (exceeding 750 ml/hour) in the
absence of surgical sources of the bleeding and lack of efficacy of
the conventional hemostatic procedures: adequate neutralization of
heparin with protamine sulfate, high doses of aprotinin,
aminocaproic acid, fresh frozen plasma transfusion. NovoSeven
was administered 44–158 (105 ± 24) min after neutralization of
heparin with protamine sulfate. The dosage of the agent was
1.8 ± 0.3 mg, or 22 ± 3 µg/kg. The data were statistically
processed, with evaluation of the significance of the differences
using Student’s t test.
Results For 2 hours immediately after the administration of rFVIIa, the
rate of the bleeding decreased from 1270 ± 240 to 182 ± 26 ml/hour.
During the following hours of observation it was no different from
the values acceptable for cardiosurgical interventions (125 ± 17–
35 ± 7 ml/hour) (Table 1).
Conclusion The depletion of factor VII plasma activity that occurs
during cardiosurgical interventions may cause coagulopathic
bleeding refractory to the standard therapy. There are several
possible mechanisms for the impairment of the factor VII activity
during the EC surgeries: hemodilution; hypothermia; contact
activation of the components of the haemostasis system due to
interaction of the blood with foreign surface of the EC-device
contour; consumption of the factor and depletion of its plasma
concentration due to ingress of the tissue factors into the systemic
circulation after aspiration of the wound contents into the
cardiotomic reservoir of the EC device. NovoSeven produces a
potent haemostatic effect in bleeding events refractory to the
conventional therapy complicating the cardiosurgical interventions
and substantially decreases the demand for blood transfusion.

Federation
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P167 (doi:10.1186/cc4514)
The presented study evaluates the feasibility of recombinant
activated factor VII (rFVIIa) (NovoSeven) to control bleeding in 28
patients with thrombocytopenia of different etiology (idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura — 4/28, acute myelocytic leukemia —
10/28, acute lymphoblastic leukemia — 2/28, non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma — 8/28, aplastic anemia — 2/28, chronic hepatitis C —
2/28) complicated with hemorrhagic syndrome. The platelet count
in the selected group of patients varied from 3 × 109/l to 80 × 109/l
(mean 31 × 109/l). Some of the patients suffered from coagulo-
pathy (associated with hepatitis — five cases, associated with
sepsis — 10 cases, and associated with bleeding — six cases). All
patients experienced severe bleeds: postoperative — eight cases,
CNS — seven cases, epistaxis — four cases, gastrointestinal —
three cases, pulmonary hemorrhage — one case, after central line
placement or other invasive manipulation — five cases. The majority
received supportive treatment with FFP and/or PLT and RBC
transfusions, which was unsuccessful. A mean dose of 86 mg/kg
rFVIIa (range 41–114 mg/kg) was administered as an intravenous
bolus injection. Fifteen patients received the treatment once, 11
patients were given a second dose of rFVIIa, and two patients
received three doses.
Laboratory haemostatic tests revealed a reduction of the PT of
1.5–2 times compared with the levels before administration of
rFVIIa (Table 1). Thromboelastography (TEG) was performed in 18
patients. Before administration of rFVIIa the reaction time (R) was
within the normal range, but the kinetic time (K) was prolonged and
the maximum amplitude (MA) decreased, both results indicating a
low platelet count. After administration of rFVIIa, eight patients
appeared to have improved TEG parameters, in seven cases these
parameters worsened, and in three cases the TEG parameters

remained unchanged (Table 2). In 16 cases bleeding stopped
10–30 min following the injection, and decreased dramatically in
six cases. Six patients did not achieve effective hemostasis after
administration of rFVIIa. Bleeding reoccurred in seven cases after
6 hours and more following infusion of rFVIIa. In 25 cases no
adverse events were reported; two patients developed high
temperature (38.7°C and 39.0°C) within 15 min after the injection
of rFVIIa. The described observations suggest efficiency of rFVIIa
in controlling the postoperative and spontaneous bleeding in
patients with various types of thrombocytopenia. Nevertheless, the
laboratory tests do not always correlate with clinical efficiency of
this treatment.

Scientific Center for Cardiovascular Surgery named after AN Bakulev,
Moscow, Russian Federation
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P168 (doi:10.1186/cc4515)
Objective To evaluate the opportunities of recombinant activated
factor VII (rFVIIa) in pediatric patients with bleeding after cardiac
surgery.
Methods Since January 2003, 90 pediatric patients received
rFVIIa for bleeding after cardiac surgery. Indications for rFVIIa were
the following: prevention of bleeding after major surgery in
newborns (arterial switch operation, radical correction of truncus
arteriosus, Norwood’s procedure) or bleeding rate 5 ml/kg/hour
and more in older children — 75 patients (group A); severe tracheal
bleeding in sepsis and multiple organ failure — six patients (group
B); uncontrolled bleeding during total cardiopulmonary bypass with
ECMO — nine patients (group C). Children’s age was 2 days–
18 years, body weight was 1.7–89 kg.
In group A the mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 223 ± 29 min
(108–423 min). Before rFVIIa was used the thrombocyte quantity
increased up to 60 × 109/l, the ACT time was less 180 s and the
body temperature was more than 35ºC. FVIIa (120 µg/kg) was
used 10–45 min after bypass. If needed, a repeated dose of
120 µg/kg was given after 1–1.5 hours (36 patients).
In group B severe tracheal bleeding developed in ventilated
patients despite thrombocyte transfusions and 5000 UE/kg/hour
aprotinin. rFVIIa was used in all patients twice (120 µg/kg).
In group C severe bleeding (8–42 ml/kg/hour) occurred during
cardiopulmonary bypass with ECMO. Before rFVIIa administration
the ACT was maintained between 180 and 200 s, the PLT quantity
was not below 50 × 109/l and the aprotinin infusion rate was
10,000 UE/kg/hour. In all cases rFVIIa was used twice with a dose
of 120 µg/kg.
Results In group A bleeding stoppage (<1 ml/kg/hour) was
reached in 49 patients (65.3%) 40–75 min after FVIIa administra-
tion; in 17 cases (22.7%) the bleeding rate decreased to
1–4 ml/kg/hour (incomplete effectiveness) and stopped after
3–6 hours. In nine patents (12%) resternotomy was fulfilled
because of ineffectiveness of rFVIIa therapy (bleeding rate
5 ml/kg/hour and more). Effectiveness of rFVIIa was higher in early
administration of the drug (10–15 min after bypass). Following the
hematology test, changes occurred: the APTT, INR and the SFMC
concentration were decreased and the plasma FVIIa concentration
was increased.
In group B life-threatening tracheal bleeding in mechanically
ventilated septic patients with MOF was stopped in four of six
cases (66.6%) during 30–75 min after rFVIIa administration. Both
nonresponding patients were in severe uncorrectable respiratory/
metabolic acidosis before and during FVIIa infusion (pH 7.14/7.11,
BE –12/–16 and pCO2 76/69 mmHg accordingly).
In group C the bleeding rate was decreased from 29 ± 12 ml/kg/hour
to 4 ± 2.9 ml/kg/hour 2–5 hours after the second FVIIa infusion in
six patients (66%). No cases of extracorporeal circuit/oxygenator
thrombosis were occurred.
No significant adverse effects occurred in all groups.
Conclusion rFVIIa effectively prevents and treats bleeding in
pediatric cardiac surgery, including life-threatening tracheal
bleeding in septic patients and large blood loss during prolonged
cardiopulmonary bypass with ECMO. Further research is required
to determine the indications and dose regimens in these groups of
patients.

Introduction Uncontrollable bleeding is a leading cause of death in
trauma patients and a major cause of preventable morbidity and
mortality. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) has been shown
to decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion among severely
injured blunt trauma patients. A significant difference in the
incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome was also observed
relative to standard care together with a nonsignificant difference in
mortality. While safety and efficacy of rFVIIa in trauma patients has
been demonstrated, little is known about its cost-effectiveness.
Method The cost-effectiveness of rFVIIa relative to standard care was
measured using patient-level data on survival and treatment patterns
collected prospectively in a multicenter, international, trial, and
outcomes data in the German Trauma Registry on patients matching
key inclusion/exclusion criteria in the trial. Differences in survival
observed at the end of trial and differences in healthcare cost were
projected to a lifetime for each patient to produce an estimate of
costs per life-year gained with rFVIIa. Analyses were conducted from
the German third-party payer perspective, limited to healthcare costs
and using a discount rate of 5%. The assessment considered adults
with severe blunt trauma injury who had received 8 U RBC prior to
random assignment to either three intravenous injections of rFVIIa
(200, 100, and 100 µg/kg) or three placebo injections.
Results Projected to a lifetime, the mean cost per treated patient
was €86,085 for rFVIIa and €65,875 for placebo, while life-years
gained (LYG) were 13.17 and 12.22, respectively. The incremental
cost of €21,210 and effect of 0.944 resulted in incremental costs
per LYG of €21,410 for rFVIIa. Adjusting for quality of life (QoL) in
residual life-years produced incremental quality-adjusted survival of
0.763 years and incremental costs per QALY gained of €26,502.
Using a conservative threshold of €30,000 for cost-effective
healthcare technologies, results appeared most sensitive to
assumptions about residual life expectancy and QoL.
Conclusion rFVIIa is a cost-effective adjunctive therapy for control
of bleeding in patients with severe blunt trauma injuries when
compared with standard care in Germany.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P170 (doi:10.1186/cc4517)
Introduction Patients with severe and persistent bleeding have
high mortality. rFVIIa has been approved for the prophylaxis and
treatment of the following types of hemorrhages: in patients with
inhibitors of the coagulation, with congenital deficiency of FVII and
with Glanzmann thrombasthenia. The aim of the study was to
evaluate the role of rFVIIa on blood transfusion requirements and
its safety. Recently there have been reports of this use in refractory
severe hemorrhage (liver transplantation, trauma patients, upper GI
bleeding, intracerebral hemorrhage).
Materials and methods Retrospective analyses of all the patients
admitted to our hospital who received rFVIIa as treatment for
severe bleeding and failure to standard therapy for massive
hemorrhage, between January 2000 and November 2005, were
made in this study. We obtained for all our patients: demographic
data, cause of admission, cause of the hemorrhagic episode and
the total doses of rVIIa. We analyzed the total number of blood
products administered before and after rVIIa, the coagulation
parameters, the adverse effects of rFVIIa and the mortality. We
performed statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon test and
considered statistical significance for P < 0.05.
Results A total of 30 patients fulfilling the definition of massive
hemorrhage were included. Their mean age was 54.4 years. In two of
30 patients rFVIIa was used as preoperative prophylaxis in high-risk
surgeries. rFVIIa was administered using the standard dosage: as an
initial bolus of 60–90 µg/kg, and with repeated doses as needed for
clinical control of hemorrhage (between one and three doses with
2–6 hour intervals). We were able to control the hemorrhage in
68.4% of our patients. Also the total number of packed red blood cell
units decreased from 11 to 3 U per patient (P < 0.014). Moreover the
administration of fresh frozen plasma decreased from an average of 7
to 1 U (P < 0.044). The total number of platelets units decreased but
was not statistically significant (P = 0.07). The transfusion of rFVIIa
also caused an improvement of the coagulation parameters,
especially the prothrombin time (P < 0.004). We observed adverse
effects in three patients (one ischemic stroke and two cardiac
tamponades), although a direct association to the use of rFVIIa could
not be made. Mortality at 30 days was 58%.
Conclusion The administration of rFVIIa in our patients with
massive hemorrhage appears to decrease the transfusional
requirements, although this is only a retrospective descriptive
analysis. In our experience rFVIIa seems to be a fairly safe drug,
although this is not a safety study.

Introduction Recent advances have demonstrated a close
association between coagulation and inflammation. The systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a common host
response following trauma. Recombinant activated factor VII
(rFVIIa) has been used to treat post-traumatic coagulopathy, but its
impact on inflammation is unclear. The purpose of this study was to
determine whether rFVIIa influences post-traumatic host inflammation.
Hypothesis rFVIIa will increase the inflammatory response
following trauma.
Methods As part of an ongoing study to characterize the
inflammatory response among critically ill trauma patients with
SIRS, we identified four patients who received rFVIIa for treatment
of traumatic coagulopathy. These patients were matched (TRISS,
mechanism of injury, and age) with four SIRS patients who did not
receive rFVIIa. Whole blood from both groups was analyzed for 78
inflammatory biomarkers by immunoassay. The average time from
rFVIIa dose to sample was 36 hours. Data are expressed as the
mean ± SD. Student’s t test was used to determine significance
between means of each group.
Results Both groups were similarly matched for mechanism (blunt:
75% each group), TRISS (0.76 rFVIIa vs 0.74 control), and age
(66 years rFVIIa vs 63 years control). rFVIIa patients had
significantly lower levels of factor VII detected by immunoassay
compared with control (127.8 ± 9 vs 283.5 ± 77.2 ng/ml,
P < 0.04). The proinflammatory proteins that increased in the
rFVIIa group are presented in Table 1. No other proinflammatory or
any anti-inflammatory markers demonstrated significant differences
between groups.

CA-125 (U/ml) 14.21 ± 6.68 2.65 ± 1.22 0.01
Conclusions Based on our preliminary results, rFVIIa induces a
mild proinflammatory (TNF-α) state associated with neutrophil
chemoattractants (IL-8, MIP-1β) and extracellular matrix breakdown
(MMP-2, MDC). Lower factor VII levels in the treatment group may
be secondary to clotting factor consumption following rFVIIa
administration.

Methods Experiments were performed using a mild hemorrhagic
(10% of total blood volume) shock model in rats. The blood
vessels (A2 and V2) of the cremaster muscle were observed. One
hour after hemorrhage was induced, FITC-labeled L-HES (MW
150,000–200,000) or M-HES (MW 175,000–225,000) or H-HES
(MW 550,000–850,000) was administered within 15 min. The
retention of HES was evaluated by the contrasting density of the
brightness of fluorescence on the image stored on the PC.

than L-HES, with no difference between M-HES and H-HES (Fig. 1).
Conclusion M-HES (MW 175,000–225,000) seems to have large
molecules, which is enough to maintain the blood volume after
hemorrhage.

Abdominal aortic surgery patients are at risk for renal dysfunction,
notably if preoperatively the renal function is impaired. This
sensitive patient population was chosen to prove that the recent
hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 has no adverse renal effects as
asserted for less metabolisable HES preparations.
After IRB approval and signed informed consent, 65 adult patients
scheduled for abdominal aortic surgery were randomly allocated to
receive either 6% HES 1300.4 (Voluven, n = 32) or 3% gelatin
solution (Plasmion, n = 33) for perioperative volume substitution.
The daily dose limitation for HES was 50 ml/kg body weight
Baseline renal function was impaired in all patients (creatinine
clearance (CrCl) <80 ml/min). The primary renal safety parameter
was the peak increase in serum creatinine through day 6 after
surgery. Both groups were compared for non-inferiority of HES
(predefined non-inferiority range HES < gelatin + 17.68 mol/l or 0.2
mg/dl). Other renal safety parameters were minimum postoperative
CrCl, incidence of oliguria (urine output <500 ml/day), and adverse
events (AEs) related to the renal system until hospital discharge.
Baseline characteristics, surgical procedures, and the mean total
infused colloid volumes were similar between both groups.
Postoperatively, the mean peak increase in creatinine was slightly
higher in gelatin patients. Non-inferiority of HES was statistically
proven by means of the appropriate nonparametric one-sided 95%
CI for the difference HES–gelatin (–∞, 11 µmol/l). The minimum
postoperative CrCl was lower for gelatin (see Table 1, mean values
± SD). Oliguria occurred in a few patients only (three HES vs four
gelatin patients). One patient of the gelatin group required dialysis
treatment following a cascade of AEs related to surgical
complications. Mortality in both groups was 6% (two deaths/
group). No drug-related unfavourable effects on renal function
were found for volume substitution with HES 130/0.4 compared
with gelatin in patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency
undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic surgery.

Introduction Early fluid resuscitation is suggested to be beneficial
sepsis therapy. Using a faecal peritonitis model we tested effects of
two new synthetic high-molecular hydroxyethyl starches, 6%HES
700/0.42/2.5:1 (HES700/2.5:1) and 6%HES 700/0.42/6:1
(HES700/6:1), compared with 6%HES 130/0.42 (HES130) and
ringer’s solution (RS) on plasma volume (PV), heart rate (HR), mean
arterial pressure (MAP) and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2).
Methods A prospective randomized, controlled animal laboratory
study in a university animal laboratory. Twenty-five anaesthetized,
ventilated pigs (28.4 ± 2.3 kg) received 1 g/kg/body weight faeces
into the abdominal cavity to induce sepsis and were observed over
8 hours. Animals were randomized (five to each group) to volume
replacement therapy with colloids or RS and were compared with a
nonseptic control group receiving RS. The infusion rate was titrated to
maintain a central venous pressure of 12 mmHg. PV was determined
using chromium-51-tagged erythrocytes. Systemic haemodynamics
and oxygenation were obtained before (Pre) and 8 hours after
induction of sepsis. Statistics were performed with ANOVA.
Results The PV (ml/kg/body weight) was significantly higher at study
end with every kind of colloid (HES700/2.5:1: 68.5 ± 11.7;
HES700/6:1: 65.5 ± 14.3, HES130: 64.4 ± 4.6) compared with RS
(40.6 ± 5.9; P ≤ 0.05). The HR (1/min) rose in all peritonitis groups
but not in the control group (NS). The MAP (mmHg) was significantly
lower in the RS group (67 ± 11) compared with control (92 ± 4; P ≤
0.05), but not in colloid-treated groups (HES700/2.5:1: 87 ± 15;
HES700/6:1: 88 ± 12, HES130: 86 ± 11). SvO2 (%) remained
stable in all HES-treated animals and the control group over 8 hours,
with significantly higher SvO2 in all groups (HES700/2.5:1: 69 ± 3;
HES700/6:1: 67 ± 16, HES130: 69 ± 8; control 70 ± 5) compared
with RS at the study end (44 ± 17; P ≤ 0.05).
Conclusion In this model, new high-molecular artificial colloids and
HES130 could maintain the PV and preserve SvO2 and
haemodynamics significantly better than RS.

Comparison effect of 6% hydroxyethyl starch with Ringer’s
solution on splanchnic perfusion in canine with septic shock

Introduction 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) is an artificial colloid.
HES and Ringer’s solution (RS) are usually used to restore adequate
volume in patients with septic shock, but their effects on splanchnic
perfusion with septic shock were not clear. This prospective and
randomized study was therefore to compare the effect of HES with
that of RS on splanchnic perfusion in canine with septic shock.
Materials and methods Twenty-four mongrel dogs with septic
shock induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were randomized to
be divided into two groups (HES group and RS group). Each
group was to receive an intravenous infusion of HES or RS
(1 ml/kg/min) for 60 min, followed by normal saline for 180 min at
the same rate. Hemodynamic and oxygendynamic and splanchnic
perfusion parameters were repeated at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180,
240 min after the basic measurement (pre-LPS).
Results After LPS infusion, the mean arterial pressure (MAP),
cardiac output index (CI), and mesenteric blood flow decreased in
all animals (P < 0.05). After fluid resuscitation, the MAP increased
to pre-LPS value after 60 min in the HES group significantly, but
after 120 min in the RS group. The CI increased significantly in
both groups (P < 0.05).
After LPS infusion, the oxygen delivery (DO2) and mesenteric blood
flow decreased in all animals (P < 0.05). Compared with 0 min,
DO2 increased by fluid therapy in both groups. Mesenteric blood
flow increased from 70 ± 35 to 100 ± 40 ml/min after 60 min in the
HES group, and the intramucosal pH (pHi) also increased, and
arterial lactate concentration and Pg-aCO2 decreased significantly
(P < 0.05), but there were no differences in RS group.
Discussion Our present study showed that both HES and RS
could raise arterial pressure and oxygen delivery in canines with
septic shock. HES and RS therefore had similar effects on
systemic hemodynamics and oxygen delivery.
Pg-a CO2 and pHi were important signals of intestinal perfusion —
low pHi and high Pg-a CO2 indicated inadequate intestinal
perfusion and hypoxia. Therefore the gut has been regarded as the
motor of MODS. Compared with baseline values, the mesenteric
blood flow increased, and also the intramucosal pH (pHi)
increased, and the arterial lactate concentration and Pg-aCO2
decreased significantly in the HES group, but there were no
differences in the RS group. Our results indicated that HES
improve splanchnic perfusion.
Conclusion This work demonstrated both HES and RS could
improve the hemodynamic state of canines with septic shock, but
on splanchnic perfusion HES was better than RS.

Background HES containing infusion solutions are used to
effectively maintain circulating blood volume (normovolaemia) or to
treat hypovolaemia in various medical fields. The exclusive use of
normal saline-based fluids may be associated with the develop-
ment of a hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. The goal of this
study was to prove equivalence of 6% HES 130/0.4 in a balanced
electrolyte solution (HES balanced) with 6% HES 130/0.4 in
saline solution (HES saline) regarding colloid volume requirements
in cardiac surgery. Effects on serum chloride, arterial pH, base
excess (BE) and haemodynamic effects of HES balanced were
investigated in comparison with HES saline. Superiority of HES
balance regarding acid–base status parameters was to be proven.
Patients and methods A prospective, randomised, double-blind,
parallel-group, multicentre, clinical phase III study. Up to 50 ml/kg
study drug could be infused until 24 hours after cardiac surgery.
Forty-three patients were treated with HES balanced, 38 patients
were treated with HES saline. The volume of study drug needed for
adequate volume therapy until 6 hours after the end of surgery, the
chloride level and the arterial pH at the end of surgery were
recorded. ANOVA/ANCOVA was performed as appropriate.
Results In the IIT analysis of the primary efficacy parameter, mean
volumes of HES were 2391 ml in HES balanced or 2241 ml in
HES saline, and equivalence (–500 ml; 500 ml) was proven (95%
CI: –77 ml; 377 ml). Serum chloride levels were significantly lower
after infusion of HES balanced. There were no differences in
haemodynamic parameters between groups. The mean BE was at
all times less negative in patients treated with HES balanced
compared with HES saline. At the end of surgery the group
difference of BE was 1.17 ± 0.42 mmol/l (P = 0.0032).
Table 1 (abstract P176)
HES balanced HES saline P value
Cl– (mmol/l) 110.0 ± 0.58 111.8 ± 0.61 0.0171
Arterial pH 7.378 ± 0.006 7.365 ± 0.007 0.0793
Conclusion The volume of HES needed was equivalent between
treatment groups. Serum chloride levels were significantly lower
after infusion of HES balanced, which reflects the lower chloride
load of similar infusion volumes. Regarding the acid–base
physiology, the HES balanced solution showed clear advantages.
The significant lower serum chloride values were accompanied by
less acidosis, as indicated by less negative BE values at all time
points after baseline, and a trend towards a higher arterial pH.

Introduction The use of albumin for the treatment of severe sepsis
remains controversial. The SAFE study [1] reported a mortality rate
of 35.2% in the group resuscitated with saline compared with
30.7% in the group that received albumin (relative risk 0.74,
P = 0.09). This potential beneficial effect could be explained by
several properties of albumin (correction of hypovolemia, of low
oncotic pressure or of hypoalbuminemia, antioxidative and anti-
inflammatory properties). Despite existing recommendations,
albumin remains largely underused in this indication. Given its
higher cost compared with other volume expansion products,
modelling of its cost/efficacy ratio would be justified in light of the
product’s potential advantages.

Methods Everyday medical practice was compared with
systematic use of albumin. The study population was defined as all
adult patients having been treated for severe sepsis in one of the
35 units in the CUB-Rea database between 1 January 1998 and
31 December 2002, not including burn patients, patients with
mediastinitis, organ transplant recipients and those having received
extracorporeal circulation (n = 11,137). Only hospital stays longer
than 24 hours and including at least circulatory, kidney or
respiratory failure were considered. The costs of intensive care
were calculated using the GHS cost (cost of stay) + the daily
intensive care cost. Two indicators of efficacy were used: the
number of lives saved and the number of years of life gained, using
as the baseline case the 4.6% reduction in mortality in the albumin
arm of the SAFE study. The cost of albumin was estimated based
on the quantities administered in this same study (2.24 l). Life
expectancy was determined using the DEALE method with the
following factors: age, sex, IGS2 score and MacCabe score.
Results There were 5980 deaths in intensive care in the CUB-Rea
database. The use of albumin induced a 4.6% reduction in the
number of deaths (512 deaths avoided). Mean survival of the 5156
patients released alive from the hospital was estimated at 9.78
years (95% CI: 9.64–9.92). The average cost per patient of
administration of albumin was evaluated at €78.10. The cost per
life saved was €6073 and per year of life saved was €617.
Conclusion Application of the SAFE results to the CUB-Rea data
showed a highly favourable cost/efficacy ratio for the use of
albumin in severe sepsis.

Effect of bicarbonated Ringer’s solution on PaCO2 and
tissue PO2 in hemorrhagic shock rats

Background and objectives Bicarbonated Ringer’s solution (BRS)
is considered to be an ideal extracellular fluid solution because it
contains bicarbonate, which does not need metabolic processes to
exert alkalinizing effect. But administration of a large amount of BRS
arouses concern about negative effects of acute alkalinizing such as
metabolic alkalosis and a leftward shift of Hb-O2 saturation curves.
In this study, we observed an impact of a large amount of BRS on
PaCO2 and tissue PO2 during hemorrhagic shock.
Methods Fifty male SD rats were divided into five groups: a sham-
operated group (Sham), hemorrhagic shock without infusion (HS
group), hemorrhagic shock with infusion of normal saline (NS group)
and bicarbonated and acetated Ringer’s solutions (BRS and ARS
groups). Thirty minutes after hemorrhage (2 ml/100 g), resuscitation
fluids (three times as much as bleeding) were administered over 30
min. The tissue PO2 and laser Doppler tissue blood flow was
continuously observed, and blood gas analysis was performed.
Results HCO3
– decreased in all the hemorrhagic groups. HCO3
–
increased in the BRS and ARS groups after resuscitation, while it
kept decreasing in the NS group. PaO2 and PaCO2 recovered to
their control values after infusion. PaO2 kept increasing more, but
PaCO2 gradually decreased after resuscitation.
Conclusion Even if BRS was infused to large amounts for the
hemorrhage shock, metabolic alkalosis did not occur. The difference
was not seen on the tissue PO2 among the resuscitation groups. The
repression of breathing was not suggested from this result.

protective effects of EP administered after multi-trauma on lung
oxidative damage and apoptosis in a rat model with delayed
resuscitation.
Materials and methods Thirty-two male Wistar rats were equally
divided into sham-control, multi-trauma, EP and multi-trauma + EP
treatment groups. Anesthesia was performed with ketamine
hydrochloride (60 mg/kg, intramuscularly) in all groups. Multi-
trauma was applied as a moderate head trauma, left femur and tibia
fractures under anesthesia. Head trauma was created using
impaction model; a 450 g weight was dropped on to a metal plate
fixed to the head of the subjects from a 1 m height through a
Plexiglas guide tube [1]. The fractures of the tibia and femur were
created by dropping a blunt guillotine with a weight of 500 g [2].
The first and third groups were resuscitated with Ringer lactate
solution. EP (as a Ringer ethyl pyruvate solution; Sigma) was
administered 40 mg/kg intraperitoneally 6 hours after the multi-
trauma and animals were sacrificed at 24 hours. Post-trauma
treatment with EP after the multi-trauma prevented the increase in
lung tissue TBARS levels and serum MPO levels (Figs 1 and 2;
P < 0.05). Lung tissue histopathology demonstrated a dramatic
reduction in neutrophil infiltration and caspase-stained cells in the
multi-trauma + EP group.
Discussion and conclusion These results suggest that a single
dose of EP inhibits leukocyte infiltration and oxidative lung damage,
even when given 6 hours after the multi-trauma. EP warrants further
evaluation as a therapeutic agent to ameliorate multi-trauma-
induced acute lung injury.

Effect of ethyl pyruvate against un-injurious spinal cord
ischemia in rats
K Sugahara, J Tokumine, K Teruya
University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P180 (doi: 10.1186/cc4527)
Introduction Paraplegia is a complication that sometimes occurs
after successful operations on the thoracic aorta with an incidence
rate ranging from 0.9% to 40%. The primary cause of such spinal
cord injury is ischemia. Pyruvate, a glycolytic intermediate, is a
promising substance with a protective effect against ischemia. Its
mechanism of action has been assumed to be an energy supply to
augment the ATP level, and free radical scavenging. However,
pyruvate is fragile in aqueous solution, and its use is thus
restricted. Ethyl pyruvate (EP) is a novel ester derivative of
pyruvate, which is stable in solution and dissolves immediately into
pyruvate in blood. The objective of this study was to evaluate
whether EP can improve the neurological outcome in a rat spinal
ischemia/reperfusion model.
Methods We used male Sprague–Dawley rats, and spinal cord
ischemia was induced for 9 min, in which most rats tend to
become paraplegic, using an intra-aortic balloon occlusion. EP was
dissolved in saline under sonication with a final concentration of
28 mmol/l. We administered 2 ml EP solution pre and post
ischemic interval. For the control, saline (vehicle fluid) was
administered at the same times. The neurological function of the
lower extremities was assessed with the BBB scale at 24 and
72 hours after ischemia. A histochemical examination of the spinal
cord was performed for neurons or apoptotic bodies.
Results and discussion The motor function of the lower
extremities (BBB scale) of the EP group was better than the saline
group at 24 and 72 hours after ischemia. The number of neurons
stained for NeuN in the EP group was higher than those in the
saline group, but less than the normal control (no treatment)
(P < 0.001). The number of apoptotic bodies in the EP group was
less than those in the saline group (P < 0.001). We demonstrated
that the EP improved the neurological outcome after a transient
ischemia and reperfusion model in rats. The histological findings
supported the hypothesis that EP protected the neurons against
ischemic injury. This is a first report to describe the neuroprotective
effect of EP in vivo.
Conclusions EP improved the neurological outcome after transient
ischemia and reperfusion, and also preserved the neurons.
Although the mechanism for such neuroprotection is still unclear,
inhibition of apoptosis may be related its preventive effect against
neuronal damage.

Maintenance fluids should contain at least 77 mmol
sodium per liter for critically ill pediatric patients

Background Disorders of sodium and water metabolism are
frequently encountered in hospitalized patients. Hyponatremia in
critically ill patients can cause significant morbidity and mortality. It
remains uncertain what should be the composition of maintenance
fluids for critically ill pediatric patients. We conducted a
prospective randomized trial to compare the effect of fluids
composition on hyponatremia in a heterogeneous population of
pediatric patients.
Methods We randomly assigned patients who had been admitted
to hospital to receive maintenance fluids of 34 mmol/l (group I) or
50 mmol/l (group II) or 77 mmol/l (group III) sodium during the first
72 hours of hospitalization. The primary outcome measure was to
determine the relation between hyponatremia and fluid
composition, the secondary outcome was to identify the optimal
maintenance fluids for critically ill children.
Results Of the 77 patients who underwent randomization, 24 were
assigned to group I, 27 to group II and 26 to group III; the three
groups had similar baseline characteristics. There were 41.7%
(n = 10) with hyponatremia in group I, 37% (n = 10) in group II as
compared with 15.4% (n = 4) with hyponatremia in group III. The
risk of hyponatremia was increase 3.92 times in group I and 3.23
times in group II according to group III (95% CI, 1.03–14.9 and
0.86–12.1, respectively). There were no significant differences
between the groups in the proportions of patients who were
treated in the PICU: 45.8% (n = 11) in group I, 44.4% (n = 12) in
group II and 42.3% (n = 11) in group III (P = 0.78). In all the
groups hyponatremia developed especially in PICU patients: 70%
(n = 7) in group I, 80% (n = 8) in group II and 100% (n = 4) in
group III (P < 0.001).
Conclusions The most important factor for hospital-acquired
hyponatremia is the administration of hypotonic fluid. Hyponatremia
risk increases especially in critically ill pediatric patients. In patients
in the PICU, for preventing of hyponatremia, maintenance fluids
should contain at least 77 mmol/l sodium.

The accuracy of tonicity balance formulas in predicting
changes in plasma sodium in ventilated infants with
respiratory syncitial virus bronchiolitis

Guy’s and St Thomas NHS Trust, London, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P182 (doi: 10.1186/cc4529)
Objective Infants with respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) infection
demonstrate avid renal water retention due to raised antididuretic
hormone activity and are at risk of hyponatraemia [1]. Fluid
restriction (48 ml/kg/day) and diuretics are often required to
prevent this occurrence and to maintain fluid and sodium balance.
Many methods have been postulated for predicting tonicity balance
and the resulting change in plasma sodium (Na) changes. These
include calculating the tonicity balance using intake/output of
water with net Na flux (tonoNa), Na and K flux (tonoNa+K), and
more recently with the Nguyen–Kurtz method [2-4]. The objective
of this study was to document the water and electrolyte balance,
and to document the accuracy of these different tonicity balance
methods to predict Na changes during the first day of intensive
care admission in ventilated infants with bronchiolitis.
Method We prospectively enrolled 30 consecutive infants (median
weight 4.3 kg) with bronchiolitis requiring mechanical ventilation to
a tertiary PICU. Infants were placed on a fluid-restricted regime of
48 ml/kg/day 0.9% saline intravenously or oral feed when
tolerated, and were studied over the first 24 hours following PICU
admission. Blood samples were collected on admission and at
24 hours; urine collection over this period was analysed for
osmolality and electrolyte content. The volume and content of all
fluid inputs, including drugs, were recorded over the same time
periods. Data are presented as the median (IQR).
Results The admission plasma Na was 140 mmol/l (138–141)
and after 24 hours was 139 mmol/l (138–143). The net electrolyte
and fluid balance is presented in Table 1 with almost neutral
balance for Na, K and Cl and fluid, in keeping with the fact that
plasma Na did not change over the 24-hour period (P = 0.9). Free
water clearance predicted a net gain of water of 10 ml/kg/day
(5–17). Electrolyte free water clearance using urine Na and K
predicted a net gain of 17 ml/kg/day (7–26) free water.
Consequently both the tonicity balance with Na and with Na and K
predicted a significant fall in plasma Na at 24 hours: 137 mmol/l
(136–139, P = 0.1), and 136 mmol/l (135–140, P = 0.006),
respectively. The Nguyen–Kurtz method was most accurate and
predicted no change in plasma Na: 142 mmol/l (136–147,
P = 0.06). Bias with 95% limits of agreement for predicting plasma
Na with the tonoNa, tonoNa+K and Nguyen methods were –2 (–9
to 13), –3 (–10 to 5) and 2 (–9 to 13) mmol/l, respectively.
Conclusion Fluid restriction of ventilated infants with bronchiolitis
results in a neutral balance of water and elelctrolytes and no
resulting change in plasma Na. Tonicity balance methods using the
net Na balance or Na and K balance overestimate free water
retention and predicted lower plasma Na values. The Nguyen–
Kurtz method, although more complex, provides the most accurate
method of predicting plasma Na changes in these patients.

Therapeutic effects of hypertonic saline on peritonitis-
induced septic shock with multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome in rats

Significant mortality in patients with sepsis results from the
development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
More recently, small-volume resuscitation with 4 ml of 7.5% NaCl
per kilogram of body weight of hypertonic saline (HS) has been
proposed to restore physiological hemodynamics in hypotensive
conditions such as hemorrhagic shock. We therefore hypothesized
that HS resuscitation may alleviate the development of MODS in
sepsis. In order to test this possibility, we evaluated effects of
hypertonic saline in a rat sepsis model induced by cecal ligation
and puncture (CLP). Our results demonstrated that CLP for
18 hours was associated with circulatory failure (i.e., hypotension
and vascular hyporeactivity to norepinephrine), MODS (examined
by biochemical parameters and histological studies) and severe
18-hour mortality. Animals treated with HS (7.5% NaCl, 4 ml/kg; at
3 hours after CLP surgery) not only ameliorated the deterioration of
hemodynamic changes but also attenuated polymorphonuclear
neutrophil (PMN) infiltration in the lung and the liver. In addition,
HS increased the survival rate at 9 and 18 hours when compared
with the CLP group. Moreover, HS reduced plasma nitric oxide
(NO) and IL-1β and organ O2
– levels in CLP-treated rats. In
conclusion, HS prevented circulatory failure and alleviated MODS
as well as decreasing the mortality rate in CLP-treated animals.
These beneficial effects of HS may be attributed to reducing the
plasma concentration of NO and IL-1β as well as the organ O2
–
level and decreasing lung PMN infiltration and liver necrosis, and
thus decreasing the mortality rate in peritonitis-induced septic
animals. Our study suggests that HS could be a cheap and novel
therapeutic agent in the early sepsis animals or patients.

Objectives Intravascular fluid resuscitation is one of the mainstays
of supportive therapy in severe sepsis or septic shock. However,
despite decades of research, there is still ongoing controversy
whether crystalloid or colloid fluids should be used. Therefore the
choice of fluids varies widely. In order to describe current clinical
practice, we analyzed the epidemiological data derived from the
Prevalence Study of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock in Intensive
Care Units in Germany.
Methods The study was designed as a prospective observational
cross-sectional study. A representative random sample of 454
ICUs out of a total 2075 ICUs was obtained. According to hospital
size, five strata (<200, 201–400, 401–600, >600 beds and
university hospitals) were established. All data were collected by
specially trained physicians from SepNet who used ACCM/SSCP
criteria. Visits were randomly distributed over a 1-year period to
allow assessment of seasonal variations.
Results Four hundred and fifteen patients with severe sepsis or
septic shock were identified, representing a total of approximately
1500 patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock. Crystalloids
were administrated in 87% of the patients. In this subgroup 57%
received full electrolyte solutions (median: 1500 ml; 25/75
percentile: 1000–2000 ml), whereas in 30% of patients NaCl
0.9% was used (1000 ml; 500–1575 ml). A combination of 0.9%
NaCl with full electrolyte solutions was administered in 12.8% of
patients. Other crystalloid solutions such as 1/2 or 2/3 electrolyte
solution or glucose 5% did not play a role in fluid therapy. Artificial
colloids such as gelatins or hydroxyethyl starch (HES 6% or 10%)
were used much less frequently. Gelatins, HES (6%) or HES
(10%) were administered as follows: gelatins, 10.2% (500 ml;
500–1000 ml); HES (6%), 23.5% (500 ml; 500–1000 ml); HES
(10%), 12.1% (500 ml; 500–1000 ml). A combination of
crystalloids and colloids was observed in 36.3% of the patients.
Albumin (HA) was used in 0.5% (HA 5%) and 4.0% (HA 20%) of
the patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in
hospital-size strata.
Conclusion There is a marked preference for crystalloid fluid
resuscitation (87% of patients) in the treatment of severe sepsis in
Germany, whereas colloids are used to a much lesser degree (46%),
among them most frequently HES 6% (24%) and gelatins (10%).
Human albumin does not play a role in volume replacement therapy.
Fluid choice is not associated with hospital size. The relatively low
amount of colloids administered may be explained by time delay
between onset of sepsis and the visiting day (mean 7.7 days).

Introduction Surgical patients receive various intravenous
maintenance fluids after major surgical procedures. Usually these
fluids are prescribed by most junior surgical trainees with different
levels of experience. We surveyed intravenous maintenance fluid
therapy for post major abdominal surgery patients among surgical
trainees in London, UK.
Objective To assess the current intravenous fluid optimisation
practice among surgical senior house officers (SHOs), after major
abdominal operations.
Methods Surgical SHOs were contacted by telephone. The
answers for a set of questions regarding their level of experience,
including intensive care training, and choice of intravenous fluids
for major abdominal surgical procedures were recorded on a
paper. The telephone interview was done by a single member, for
all SHOs, and data were analysed.
Results One hundred and fifty surgical SHOs were contacted
(response rate 100%) and the results are summarised in Tables 1
and 2. The majority (67%) of the surgical trainees did not have
previous formal intensive care training. More than one-half of the
SHOs (51%) preferred 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) as
their first-choice intravenous maintenance fluid. When asked
regarding awareness of central venous saturation (ScvO2)
monitoring for fluid optimisation, only 44% of the trainees regularly
used ScvO2 as a guide to fluid therapy. Only 27% of the surgical
SHOs are aware of goal-directed therapy for surgical patients. The
SHOs who had previous intensive care experience had better
knowledge of ScvO2 monitoring (88%) and goal-directed therapy.

Sixty-one per cent of trainees monitor blood electrolytes only when
they recognise or anticipate complications.
Discussion Currently there is no clear recommendation by the
surgical or intensive care bodies regarding minimal formal intensive
care training for surgical trainees in the UK. In spite of increasing
evidence of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, caused by use of
normal saline as maintenance fluid in surgical patients, the majority
of the surgical SHOs prefer normal saline as the first-choice
maintenance fluid. Introduction of regular intensive care teaching
should be part of the curriculum for surgical training to improve the
care of critically ill surgical patients in the wards.

Introduction Present in various industrial and household products,
hydrofluoric acid (HF) is one of the most dangerous mineral acids.
Extremely aggressive for the skin, HF is responsible for immediate
tissue damage and potentially systemic complications, especially
life-threatening hydro-electrolytic perturbations. Calcium gluconate
in the form of a 2.5% gel is considered the first-aid treatment for
accidental HF skin burns. In France, a ready-to-use form is
produced and distributed to hospitals by the AGEPS. Although the
use of this gel is based on clinical practice, there is no available
controlled study on its efficacy.
Materials and methods Thirty male Wistar–Han rats of 250 g
were burned with 60 µl of a 40% HF aqueous solution on two
spots of 4 cm2 (right flank) under pentobarbital anesthesia. After a
2 min contact with HF, one lesion was treated by repeated
(n = 10) topical applications of 1 g of 2.5% calcium gluconate gel
for 4 days; the other one was untreated (control). The AGEPS
formulation and two other alternatives were evaluated in a blind
fashion (10 rats/gel). Burn severity was assessed on days 1, 2, 3,
7, 10, 14 and 17 post-injury by a visual semi-quantitative scaling
system (0–4). Treatment efficacy was evaluated by comparing
burn severity scores and areas under the curve (AUC) of treated
and untreated lesions for each animal. Statistical analysis was
performed by analysis of variance followed by the Student–
Newman–Keuls test.
Results The untreated lesion started to develop upon HF
application; it reached a maximum between days 2 and 7 (median
score: 3), before beginning to recover (day 17, median score: 1).
Treatment significantly limited the severity of burns at all time
intervals (median: –0.5 to –2) and for all scores (median: –1 for
severity scores 1, 2 and 4, –2 for score 3 lesions, P < 0.0001).
Treatment reduced the AUC days 1–17 of burn injury from 34.0
(untreated) to 17.7 (P < 0.001); there were only three cases of
treatment failure (AUC of untreated/treated: 15/21, 53.5/58.5,
51.5/50.5). At day 17, full wound recovery was obtained in 14
cases by gel therapy compared with six cases in the absence of
treatment. The efficacy of the three gel formulations was
comparable (severity scores and AUC of burn injury, number of full
recoveries).
Conclusion Calcium gluconate in the form of a 2.5% gel reduces
the severity of skin burns induced by 40% HF in a rat model. These
data support the use of the AGEPS gel as a rapid, safe, and
economical ‘first-aid’ treatment for accidental HF skin burns; more
severe burns may require additional injection of calcium gluconate.

Introduction In patients in the ICU of the Anaesthesiological Clinic
we find generally decreased selenium (Se) in serum, which does
not normalise under supplementation with standard doses of Se.
Some recently published papers demonstrate that supple-
mentation of high doses of Se significantly decreases the mortality
of patients in critical states. We therefore started in a prospective
clinical trial the supplementation of Se in high doses and followed
its influence on selected laboratory parameters, on the mean
arterial pressure (MAP) and on the survival of critically ill patients.
Methods In a randomised clinical trial, 61 ICU patients were
followed. Thirty-five of them (group 1) received standard daily
doses of Se 0.4–0.8 mmol (30–60 mg) as part of nutritional
support, 25 patients (group 2) received additional Na-selenite
containing Se through infusions in the amount of 12.7 mmol
(1000 mg) on the first day, and later 6.7 mmol (500 mg) daily until
the 14th day. In blood samples, the following were examined every
other day during this period: Se, prealbumin, albumin, cholesterol,
C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, IgM. Altogether, 150
examinations in group 1 and 119 in group 2 were performed.
Moreover, the glutation peroxidase (GSHPx) was investigated 67
times in group 1 and 34 times in group 2.
Results Presented as medians and 95% CIs. Serum Se levels
(µmol/l) group 1 = 0.292 (0.27; 0.33), group 2 = 0.57 (0.51;
0.72), P < 0.01; GSHPx (U/l) group 1 = 4059 (3854; 4346),
group 2 = 4668 (4213; 4878), P < 0.01. Reference ranges: Se
0.58–1.82 mmol/l, GSHPx 4170–10,880 U/l. There was no
statistically significant difference between both groups for all the
other biochemical parameters followed. In the supplemented group
2, the MAP could more frequently be kept above 70 Torr
(P < 0.01). Fifty-nine per cent of patients from group 1 and 72.7%
from group 2 survived their ICU stay. Neither at the dismissal from
the ICU or 1 month later was this difference statistically significant.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P188 (doi: 10.1186/cc4535)
Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate levels of N-terminal
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and its correlation to
sodium biochemical parameters in patients after elective cervical
spine surgery.
Methods We prospectively measured NT-proBNP and serum
sodium immediately after the operation, urinary loss of sodium,
creatinine clearance, sodium clearance, sodium fractional excretion,
diuresis, intake of fluids and sodium on day 1 in 50 patients and NT-
proBNP on day 2 in 30 patients after elective cervical spine surgery
for spondylosis. All patients were classified as New York Heart
Association (NYHA) I, they did not receive diuretic or osmotic
therapy and had an uneventful postoperative period.
Results Immediate postoperative NT-proBNP values were normal
(51 ± 28 pg/l), but they increased significantly on day 2
(230.5 ± 160 pg/l, P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation
between NT-proBNP on days 1 and 2 (P = 0.002), NT-proBNP
and daily urinary loss of sodium (P = 0.049) on day 1, and no other
correlations were found.
Conclusion NT-proBNP values were not increased on day 1 in
patients after elective cervical spine surgery, but they were
significantly increased on day 2 and there was a significant
correlation to daily urinary loss of sodium.

NT-proBNP levels in the ICU do not predict the etiology of
respiratory distress

Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, MA, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P189 (doi: 10.1186/cc4536)
Introduction BNP and NT-proBNP are hormones released by the
ventricular myocardium in response to pressure and volume overload.
Their levels help differentiate cardiac from noncardiac etiologies of
dyspnea. For example, NT-proBNP above 1000 pg/ml is as a cutoff
value indicating CHF is a more likely cause of dyspnea in non-ICU
patients. The applicability of this test to a mixed ICU population is
unclear and there is no known correlation between PCWP and BNP
levels in these patients. In addition, there is no known correlation
between elevated NT-proBNP and the incidence of respiratory failure.
Methods A retrospective review of our combined medical/surgical
ICU between 1 July 2004 and 30 June 2005 using Project
IMPACT (Cerner Corporation) to generate a list of patients
admitted for a variety of potential causes of dyspnea along with
NT-proBNP levels. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to determine
significant differences between five specific diagnoses; CHF/
pulmonary edema (both cardiogenic and noncardiogenic), pneumonia,
COPD exacerbation, ARF and sepsis. A receiver–operator curve
(ROC) was used to examine the sensitivity and specificity of CHF
at different NT-proBNP cutoff values.
Results A total of 47 patients out of 199 (23.6%) surveyed had
NT-proBNP measured. Forty-two of 199 (21.1%) fit into the
diagnostic categories used for comparison. The Kruskal–Wallis
test showed among the five diagnoses that only CHF and
pneumonia had significantly different NT-proBNP levels
(P = 0.0025). The difference in NT-proBNP levels between
patients with and without respiratory failure was not significant.
Results are presented in Table 1. The ROC analysis showed a
ROC AUC of 0.774, but to achieve a specificity >0.9 requires a
cutoff value of approximately 15,000 pg/ml.
Conclusion The generally accepted cutoff for NT-proBNP
supporting the diagnosis of CHF is 1000 pg/ml. The average
values in this ICU population (14,114.6 pg/ml) are well above this
cutoff value; 85% were above 1000 pg/ml but only 12/47 (25.5%)
of the patients were diagnosed with CHF. This suggests either a
higher cutoff value may be required to properly utilize the test in an
ICU population or it should be abandoned completely for patients
admitted to the ICU, especially in light of such large standard
deviations about the mean. Moreover, the data suggest that NT-
proBNP does not play a role in differentiating the etiology of
respiratory compromise.

Background B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) plasma levels have
recently been demonstrated as significant neurohormonal markers
of chronic heart failure (CHF) progression and prognosis.
Additionally, clinical studies have shown that the calcium sensitizer
levosimendan beneficially affects the central hemodynamics of
CHF patients and improves their long-term prognosis.
Purpose To investigate whether levosimendan-induced hemo-
dynamic improvement, as confirmed by echocardiogram of CHF
patients, is related to respective changes in BNP levels.
Methods Circulating levels of BNP were measured by ELISA in 37
patients with decompensated advanced CHF at baseline and
72 hours after the initiation of levosimendan treatment. Echo-
cardiographic parameters — pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), end-
diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV) and left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) — were also measured at
baseline and 72 hours after infusion initiation. We used the
threshold of 500 pg/ml for BNP, 30 mmHg for PAP and 50% for
LVEF to define patients as having altered results.
Results We retrospectively analyzed 37 consecutive CHF patients
to whom levosimendan was prescribed by the attending physician
besides standard measures. BNP levels were significantly lower

within 72 hours of levosimendan treatment (P < 0.01). A significant
reduction of PAP (P < 0.05) was also found during the same
period. A good correlation between the levosimendan-induced
changes in LVEF and the respective reduction of BNP levels
(P < 0.01) was observed.
Conclusions Our results indicate that changes in BNP levels may
be useful as biochemical markers of levosimendan-induced
improvement in echocadiographic and clinical parameters.

Significance of B-type natriuretic peptide in acute
cerebrovascular disease
R Stevens, H Puttgen, M Koenig
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P191 (doi: 10.1186/cc4538)
Introduction Increased serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
peptide (N-BNP) has been observed in congestive heart failure
(CHF), acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism and septic
shock. N-BNP elevation has also been linked with ischemic stroke
(IS) and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH); however,
the significance of N-BNP in this setting is unknown. We
hypothesized that elevated serum N-BNP may occur independently
of CHF in patients with acute cerebrovascular disease.
Design A case–control study.
Methods Patients hospitalized with acute IS, SAH, or spontaneous
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) were evaluated with serum N-BNP
testing and transthoracic echocardiography. Patients were
classified into two groups (presence or absence of CHF) using
modified Framingham criteria.
Results Sixty-seven patients were evaluated, 37 with IS, 20 with
SAH, and 10 with ICH. CHF was present in 36 patients (53%),
while elevated N-BNP (>500 pg/ml) was detected in 57 (85%).
Patients with and without CHF were not significantly different with
regard to demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, stroke sub-
type, fluid balance, and administration of diuretic, antihypertensive,
or vasoactive medications. Systolic and diastolic dysfunction and
increased serum troponin I were more common in the CHF group,
but these differences were not significant. N-BNP was markedly
elevated in both groups, and significantly higher in patients with
CHF. At a 500 pg/ml cutoff, the sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value, and negative predictive value of N-BNP for CHF
were respectively 94%, 25%, 58%, and 80%.
Conclusions Serum N-BNP has limited value for diagnosing CHF
in patients with acute cerebrovascular disease. Elevated levels in
patients without CHF point to alternative mechanisms of N-BNP
production. More work is needed to explore the pathophysiology,
diagnostic role, and prognostic significance of N-BNP in this
patient group.

Can N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin
T predict ICU and hospital mortality in patients with septic
shock?
A Turley, M de Belder, M Johnson, J Gedney

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P192 (doi: 10.1186/cc4539)
Introduction The counter-regulatory neurohormone N-terminal pro-
B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is predominantly released
from the left ventricle in response to increasing wall tension and is a
useful prognostic marker in patients with-established cardiac failure
[1]. Myocardial dysfunction commonly occurs in septic patients.
Cardiac biomarkers, including NT-proBNP, have been shown to be
predicators of mortality in unselected critically ill patients [2].
Objectives To evaluate the role of NT-proBNP and troponin T
(TnT) as predictors of mortality in patients with severe sepsis and
septic shock.
Methods A prospective observational study was carried out on
patients admitted to a noncardiothoracic tertiary ICU within 24
hours of the development of severe sepsis or septic shock. Plasma
samples were taken on all patients on admission. NT-proBNP and
TnT were determined using commercially available assays. Data
were compared after logarithmic transformation, where
appropriate.
Results Thirty-four patients met the entry criteria (mean age 61.3 ±
14.9 years, male n = 19, all patients were mechanically ventilated).
The APACHE II score of ICU survivors (median [range]) was 19
(12–33) and for nonsurvivors was 22.5 (14–38) (P = 0.19). Of the
34 patients, 11 died during their ICU admission (32%). Hospital
mortality was 15/34 (44%). NT-proBNP was elevated (>150 ng/l)
in all patients and TnT (>0.1 ng/ml) in 13 patients. Results are
summarised in Table 1.
Conclusion NT-pro-BNP and TnT are frequently elevated in severe
sepsis. However admission values are not prognostic markers of
ICU and hospital survival.

Background Heart failure and pulmonary edema have been
implicated as causes for weaning failure in mechanically ventilated
patients; however, the identification of these conditions could be
challenging in critically ill patients. The natriuretic peptide B-type
(BNP) level has been used to evaluate volemia and cardiac
function in patients with heart failure, but no data have been
published about the use of BNP to guide weaning in mechanically
ventilated patients.
Objective This study was performed to evaluate whether the BNP
level could be useful to predict weaning failure or success in
patients mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours.
Methods Sixty-three consecutive patients mechanically ventilated
for more than 48 hours in a medical/surgical ICU and who were
included in our weaning protocol had their BNP level (pg/ml)
recorded immediately before a T trial. The decision about
extubation or reintubation was made by an attending physician not
involved in this study and blinded for the BNP level. Weaning
failure was defined by the T-trial intolerance or need for
reintubation in the first 48 hours after extubation.
Results Weaning failure was observed in 16 patients (25%),
seven who failed during the T trial and nine who were extubated
but needed reintubation within 48 hours. The BNP level was
greater in the failure group when compared with the success
group (712.6 ± 151.9 vs 295.3 ± 42.4 respectively, P = 0.02).
The patients who were reintubated had a BNP level (864 ± 128.8)
higher than the success group (P < 0.001) but there were no
differences between the reintubation group and T-trial failure
(517.8 ± 146).
Conclusion BNP recorded before a T trial can be helpful to predict
weaning outcome in patients mechanically ventilated for more than
48 hours.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P194 (doi: 10.1186/cc4541)
Background and goals The aim of our study was to assess
concentrations of N-terminated propeptide type B (NTBNP), a
marker of cardiac insufficiency, and MB isoenzyme of creatine
kinase (CKMB), which level is adequate to the area of acute
myocardial necrosis, and to compare their predictive values of
survival in patients after cardiac arrest (CA).
Participants Fifty-two patients after CA (CA-patients) of age 62 ±
13 years. In 34 patients CA appeared during acute coronary
syndrome. Twenty-six patients died after CA (CA-D), and 26
patients survived and were discharged from hospital (CA-S).
Methods The state of patients after CA was assessed by scales of
proven values of survival after CA used in critical care: Glasgow
Coma Scale (GCS), Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS),
Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II). In CA-
patients the concentrations of NTpBNP and CKMB were
measured in venous blood samples taken just after CA (day 0) and
on two consecutive days (day 1 and day 2) at 8:00 am. In CA-D
and CA-S patients the concentrations of NTBNP and CKMB were
compared. In regression and survival analysis, predictive values of
concentrations of NTBNP and CKMB were assessed. Correlations
among concentrations of NTBNP, CKMB and values of the scales
used in critical care were estimated by Spearman’s correlation
coefficient.
Results The mean concentrations of NTBNP and CKMB were
higher in CA-D than in CA-S patients 3 days running but were
significantly higher only for NTBNP on day 1 (114,000 ± 112,000
vs 45,100 ± 58,000 pmol/l, P < 0.027). On day 1 similar values of
the OR of survival after CA of concentrations of NTBNP (OR 5.7
for concentrations >50,000 or ≤50,000 pmol/l, P < 0.02) and
concentrations of CKMB (OR 7.5 for concentrations >40 or
≤40 U/l, P < 0,02) were found, but it was only concentrations of
NTBNP whose OR was significant in blood on day 0 (OR 5.8 for
concentrations >50,000 or ≤50,000 pmol/l, P < 0.02). The
relationship to survival of concentrations of CKMB on day 1 and
concentrations of NTBNP on day 0 and day 1 was also confirmed
in Kaplan–Meyer survival analysis. Only concentrations of NTBNP
revealed good correlation with values of the scales used in critical
care.
Conclusions On day 1 after CA, concentrations of NTBNP and
CKMB are of predictive values of survival. In blood taken just after
CA, only the concentration of NTBNP reveals a predictive value of
survival. NTBNP is a better predictor of survival after CA than
CKMB because its concentration is of predictive value in the first 2
days after CA and of good fit with scales concerning the severity of
state of patients after CA.

Introduction The counter-regulatory neurohormone N-terminal pro-
B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is predominantly released
from the left ventricle in response to increasing wall tension and is
a useful prognostic marker in patients with cardiac failure [1].
Cardiopulmonary exercise (CPX) testing is an objective method of
assessing functional cardiac status. The anaerobic threshold (AT),
the point at which anaerobic metabolism supplements aerobic
metabolism, correlates with the severity of cardiac failure [2].
Objective and methods An ongoing, prospective, observational
study, to determine the correlation between preoperative CPX
testing and measurement of NT-proBNP (Roche) in patients
undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (open
or endovascular [EVAR]). All patients were preassessed by a
consultant vascular anaesthetist with particular emphasis on
cardiac risk factors and functional capacity (metabolic equivalents
[METs]). CPX testing was performed preoperatively, by a blinded
investigator, in a standardised manner [3] with calculation of AT
made by the V-slope method. NT-proBNP levels were also
measured preoperatively, a level >150 pg/ml considered elevated.
Results Forty-three patients were recruited, mean (SD) age
71.8 ± 8.9 years. The mean (SD) AT was 10.7 ± 3.2 ml/min/kg.
There was no significant correlation between age and AT
(r = –0.12, P = 0.45). The median level (range) of NT-proBNP was
322.8 (52–5085) pg/ml. Over 85% of patients had an NT-proBNP
level >150 pg/ml. There was a weak negative association between

S83
NT-proBNP and AT (r = –0.24, P = 0.18). Results between open
repair and EVAR are summarised in Table 1. There was a positive
correlation between AT and METs (r = 0.41, P < 0.01).
Conclusion There is no correlation between anaerobic threshold
and NT-proBNP levels in patients undergoing elective abdominal
aortic aneurysm repair but there was a definite positive correlation
between AT and functional capacity (METs). Whether CPX or
cardiac biomarkers influences outcome requires further study.

Introduction Prohormones of cardiovascular active mediators may
add important information to the clinical status of patients with
systemic inflammation. However, only little information is available
of how serum levels of such prohormones are affected by the
clinical status of critically ill patients. The goal of this study was to
identify factors that independently influence prohormone plasma
concentrations in an ICU setting.
Methods Citrate plasma samples of 185 patients with either
severe sepsis/septic shock (n = 120) or systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS, n = 65) after coronary bypass surgery
have been obtained daily, resulting in 2385 samples. The
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was also
determined daily. Midregional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide
(MR-proANP), midregional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), and
C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET-1) have been measured by
an immunoassay (BRAHMS AG, Germany). For each patient, the
maximum values of MR-proANP, MR-proADM and CT-proET-1
were identified. These maximum levels were analyzed with multiple
regression using demographic parameters and parameters of
inflammation (leukocytes [WBC], C-reactive protein [CRP],
procalcitonin) as well as the SOFA score as independent factors.
Results The mean age was 63.5 years. The mortality rate was
27% at a mean APACHE II score of 17.5. Table 1 presents
individual regression coefficients if statistically significant. CRP
levels did not correlate with any of the measured prohormones.
Conclusions Variations in the levels of measured prohormones are
only slightly affected by parameters of inflammation. However,
development of organ dysfunction is well reflected by proANP and
MR-proADM but only to a lesser degree by CT-proET-1.

Introduction Systemic inflammation is accompanied by
cardiovascular dysfunction. Prohormones of cardiovascular active
mediators may therefore add important information to the clinical
status of these patients. The goal of this study was to describe the
prognostic value of three different prohormones in an ICU setting.
Methods Citrate plasma samples of 185 patients with either
severe sepsis/septic shock (n = 120) or systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS; n = 65) after coronary bypass surgery
have been obtained on admission to the ICU. Midregional pro-atrial
natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), midregional pro-adrenomedullin
(MR-proADM), and C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET-1) have
been measured by an immunoassay (BRAHMS AG, Germany). The
prognostic value for ICU survival was estimated by the area under
the curve (AUC) of the receiver–operating characteristics (ROC).
Results The mean age was 63.5 years. The mortality rate was
27% at a mean APACHE II score of 17.5. AUC values and 95%
CIs are presented in Table 1. The AUC of the APACHE II score to
predict survival in this study was 0.70 (0.61; 0.80).
Table 1 (abstract P197)
Admission value ROC AUC 95% CI
MR-proANP 199.7 pmol/l 0.66 0.57; 0.74
MR-proADM 2.3 nmol/l 0.68 0.59; 0.77
CT-proET-1 70.5 pmol/l 0.64 0.56; 0.73
Conclusion Elevation of all three parameters is significantly
associated with a poor prognosis in critically ill patients. Outcome
prediction is similar to the APACHE II score.

Materials and methods Four hundred and seventeen medical and
surgical adult patients admitted to the general ICU of Tartu
University Clinics during 2004 and 2005 were retrospectively
studied. Eighty patients were excluded due to missing data.
Results The total ICU mortality was 29%. The survivors had
significantly smaller fluid gain during the admission day than
nonsurvivors (2.6 ± 3.3 l vs 4.7 ± 6.4 l; P < 0.001). The fluid gain
was significantly smaller in survivors who had SOFA score ≤10
(2.4 ± 3.3 l vs 3.8 ± 5.6 l in nonsurvivors; P = 0.026), but not for
those with SOFA score >10 (4.3 ± 3.7 l vs 5.3 ± 6.9 l; P = 0.525).
The fluid balance had no impact on the outcome of the latter
subgroup of patients, having lactate >4 mmol/l. However, if these
patients had lactate <4 mmol/ they significantly benefit from
positive fluid gain (Table 1).

Data presented as mean ± SD.
Conclusions The fluid gain during the admission day is associated
with increased mortality of ICU patients. Subgroup analysis
revealed that this was true for less severely ill patients (SOFA
score ≤10), but not for patients with SOFA score >10. The
positive fluid balance per se is not necessarily fatal and its effect
on outcome is mainly dependent on the severity of illness.

Determination of ‘unmeasured’ anions in acidotic ICU patients

University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P199 (doi: 10.1186/cc4546)
Metabolic acidosis is one of the most frequent acid–base
disorders occurring in the ICU. Major causes of metabolic acidosis
in critically ill patients are hyperchloremia, hyperlactatemia and the
presence of anions of unknown identity, the so-called
‘unmeasured’ anions. The latter is associated with increased
mortality and several diseases: sepsis, shock, liver dysfunction and
renal failure. The physicochemical approach described by Stewart
can be applied to quantify metabolic acidosis. Accordingly, the
strong ion gap (SIG) is a quantitative measure of ‘unmeasured’
anions. We hypothesised that derangements in amino acid and
organic acid metabolism and abnormal uric acid concentrations
could be an explanation for the SIG.
From 32 adult ICU patients with metabolic acidosis, defined as a
pH less than 7.35 and a base excess less than –5 mmol/l, the SIG
was calculated in a single arterial blood sample. Two groups were
compared: patients with SIG <2 mEq/l and patients with SIG
>5 mEq/l. ‘Unmeasured’ anions were examined quantitatively by
ion-exchange column chromatography, reverse-phase HPLC and
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry measuring, respectively,
25 amino acids, uric acid and organic acids. Some organic acids
were determined semi-quantitatively. The Mann–Whitney U test
was applied for significance (considered P < 0.05) in all cases. For
nominal data, the chi-square test was used.
Aspartic acid, isoleucine, ornithine, uric acid, succinic acid, fumaric
acid, p-OH-phenyllactic acid and the semi-quantified organic acids
3-OH-isobutyric acid, pyroglutamic acid and homovanillic acid
were all significantly elevated in the SIG >5 group (n = 12, mean =
8.3 mEq/l) compared with the SIG <2 group (n = 8, mean =
0.6 mEq/l). Generally, no major differences in organic acid spectra
between both groups were observed. However, in one patient in
the SIG >5 group who was in a prolonged fasted state at ICU
admission, 3-OH-butyric acid was extremely high: 4.0 mEq/l,
corresponding to 25% SIG. Overall, the averaged difference
between both groups in total amino acid, uric acid and organic
acid concentration contributed to the SIG for, respectively, 3.5%
(268 µEq/l, not significant), 2.2% (169 µEq/l, P = 0.021) and
1.0% (79 µEq/l, P = 0.025). The total organic acid concentration
consisted of glycolic acid, oxalic acid, methylmalonic acid, succinic
acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, adipic acid and p-OH-phenyllactic
acid. Comparison of patient characteristics of both groups showed
that age, sex, APACHE II score, pH, base excess and lactate were
not significant. However, renal insufficiency, sepsis and mortality
were more prominent in the SIG >5 group. Also, the apparent
strong ion difference (due to a significantly lower plasma chloride),
phosphate and urea were significantly elevated in the SIG >5
group.
This study demonstrates that total amino acids, uric acid and
organic acids form a minor contribution (6.8%, corresponding to
517 µEq/l) to the SIG in acidotic ICU patients.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P200 (doi: 10.1186/cc4547)
Background Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (HCMA) after
cardiac surgery is iatrogenic and is due to large volumes of saline
infused perioperatively [1]. The aim of the study was to determine
the incidence, the clinical implications and the duration of this
acid–base disorder in cardiac surgery.
Methods One hundred patients who underwent cardiac surgery
with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were included prospectively.
Exclusion criteria were: diabetes mellitus, pre-existing acid–base
abnormalities, postoperative renal failure or low cardiac output
syndrome. All patients received crystalloid (0.9% saline or
Ringer’s) and colloid solutions (gelatin). Sampling of arterial blood
for gas, acid–base parameters and serum electrolytes were
performed at four time points: 30 min after induction of anesthesia
(T1), after completion of CPB (T2), at 6 hours (T3) and at 24 hours
postoperatively (T4). Values are given as the mean ± SD. We
registered the volume of solutions administered intraoperatively
and in the first 24 hours postoperatively as well as complications:
bleeding, cardiac arrhythmias and organ dysfunctions. (renal,
pulmonary or neurological). For statistical analysis we used a t test
(P < 0.05).
Results Sixty-six patients (66%) presented a simple normal-anion
gap hyperchloremic acidosis. Twenty-seven patients had no
acidosis. The results of the arterial blood sampling are presented in
Table 1. The infused volumes are presented in Table 2.
Cardiac arrhythmias were more frequent in patients with HCMA
compared with those with no acidosis. There were no statistical
differences in the incidence of bleeding or organ dysfunctions.
Conclusions HCMA due to saline infusion is common after
cardiac surgery. However it is transient (less than 24 hours). Due
to the low number of patients in our study, the clinical relevance of

Prediction of arterial blood gas values from earlobe blood
gas values in patients receiving mechanical ventilation
A Honarmand
Esfahan Medical Sciences University, Esfahan, Iran
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P201 (doi: 10.1186/cc4548)
Background Arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling represents the
gold standard method for acquiring patients’ acid–base status. The
most common complications associated with arterial puncture are
pain, arterial injury, and thrombosis with distal ischemia,
hemorrhage, and aneurism formation. Earlobe blood gas samplings
(EBG) may be useful alternatives to ABG sampling. This study
evaluates whether the pH, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), partial
pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), base excess (BE), and
bicarbonate (HCO3
–) values of EBG accurately predict their ABG
analogs for patients treated by mechanical ventilation in an ICU.
Methods Sixty-seven patients who were admitted to the ICU and
treated by mechanical ventilation were included in this descriptive
study. Blood for ABG analysis was sampled from the radial or
brachial arteries. Blood for EBG analysis was sampled
simultaneously from ear lobe by contact with a capillary tube tip.
Regression equations and mean percentage-difference equations
were derived to predict arterial pH, PCO2, PO2, BE, and HCO3
–
values from their EBG analogs.
Results A total of 67 simultaneous arterial and earlobe blood
samples were obtained from 67 patients. The pH, PCO2, BE, and
HCO3
– ere all significantly correlated in ABG and EBG. In spite of
a highly significant correlation, the limits of agreement between the
two methods were wide for PO2. Earlobe values of PO2 were
usually lower than arterial values, with larger differences in the
range of normal arterial PO2. On the other hand, the error and the
limits of agreement were smaller for PCO2. Regression equations
for prediction of pH, PCO2, BE, and HCO3
– values were: arterial
pH (pHa) = 1.81 + 0/76 × earlobe pH (pHe) [r = 0.791,
P < 0.001]; PaCO2 = 11/44 + 0/7 × earlobe PCO2 (PeCO2)
[r = 0.774, P < 0.001]; arterial BE (BEa) = 1/14 + 0/95 × earlobe
BE (BEe) [r = 0.894, P < 0.001], and arterial HCO3
– (HCO3
–a) =
1/41 + earlobe HCO3
– (HCO3
–e) [r = 0.874, P < 0.001]. The
predicted ABG values from the mean percentage-difference
equations were derived as follows: pHa = pHe × 1.001; PaCO2 =
PeCO2 × 1.04; BEa = BEe × 0.57; and HCO3
–a = HCO3
–e ×
1.06.
Conclusions Earlobe blood gas can accurately predict the ABG
values of pH, PCO2, BE, and HCO3
– for patients receiving
mechanical ventilation.

patients?

Introduction There is evidence about pulmonary production and
release of lactate during acute lung injury. The aim of this study was
to evaluate whether the arterial–central venous lactate gradient
(AVLG) is correlated with the P/F ratio in general ICU patients.
Methods Twenty-four patients requiring mechanical ventilation for
at least 72 hours were enrolled. During the first 72 hours, we
prospectively collected and recorded central venous and arterial
blood samples to analyse blood gases and serum lactate every
24 hours. Ventilator settings as well as general patient
characteristics were also recorded. Data are shown as the median
and interquartiles. The Spearman correlation test was used and
P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results Eleven females and 13 males were evaluated. Median age
was 49 (42, 65) years old and the APACHE II score was 23 (19,
33). One-half of patients were admitted with septic shock
diagnosis. Four patients had the diagnosis of acute lung injury or
acute respiratory distress syndrome at enrollment. The median
PEEP was 10 (8, 12) cmH2O, FiO2 was 0.4 (0.3, 0.5) and the P/F
ratio was 229 (159, 315). The AVLG was evaluated as the
variation [(arterial – venous lactate) / arterial lactate] and its median
was 0.00 (–0.20, 0.08). In overall group analysis (n = 70), the P/F
ratio and AVLG correlation was –0.05 (P = 0.670). In the P/F
≤ 200 subgroup analysis (n = 25), the P/F ratio and AVLG
correlation was 0.08 (P = 0.709).
Conclusions Even though the lungs may produce and release
lactate in some patients as sepsis and acute respiratory distress
syndrome subjects, we could not find a correlation between the
AVLG and the P/F ratio in a general population of critically ill
patients. However, our results are probably underpowered.

Methods Lactate and BE levels were measured at the time of
admission along with the SAPS II and APACHE II scores. Patient
outcome at 28 days was also documented.
Results See Tables 1 and 2. Statistical analysis using a paired
t test was performed, indicating a statistical significant difference
P < 0.001 for SAPS II and P < 0.000 for the APACHE II score, and
P < 0.008 for the lactate and BE levels between the two groups.
Conclusion Lactate levels and BE appear to be independent
prognostic factors for the 28-day mortality of the newly admitted
patients in the ICU.

Objective The assessment of the validity of the osmolar gap (OG) as
an independent prognostic factor for the mortality of the newly
admitted patients compared with the SAPS II and APACHE II scores.
Participants All the newly admitted patients in two 12 (6 + 6)-bed
ICUs regardless of the cause of admission.
Method Measurement of the freezing point and simultaneous
calculation (using the known formula) of plasma osmolarity in every
patient at the time of admission. Patient data and the overall
outcome at 28 days were documented.
Results See Table 1. The findings were statistically analysed using
a paired t test and a statistically significant difference was obtained
(P < 0.001 for SAPS II and OG scores, and P < 0.000 for
APACHE II and OG scores, respectively). In addition ROC analysis
disclosed for OG an area under the curve of 0.745 ± 0.040 (SE).

Conclusion The OG appears to have good correlation with the
existing clinical scoring systems and therefore it might be used as
an independent prognostic factor. To find out the appropriate
cutoff point for the OG obviously requires a greater number of
patients in the present study, which is still underway.

Assessment of stress oxidative modulation when
conventional parenteral solutions were used compared
with nutrition based on an olive oil compound in multiple
trauma patients

Kirchberg Hospital, Luxembourg
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P205 (doi: 10.1186/cc4552)
Introduction We studied metabolic parameters from oxidative
stress response in trauma patients when using intravenous
nutrition with Oliclinomel (an olive/soybean oil mixture
characterized by an essential fatty acids content of 20%) or
Nutriflex (an soybean oil composition).
Methods A prospective, randomized study was conducted in a 16-
bed ICU during an 8-month period: family informed consent and
institutional agreement were obtained in 43 consecutive intubated
multiple traumatic patients with Injury Severity Scores of
23.2 ± 10.6; 22 patients received Oliclinomel N7 (O group [Og])
and 21 patients received Nutriflex Energy (N group [Ng]) to reach
equal caloric support in the two groups (50% of the energy
demand at day 1 to 100% at day 3). Oxidative parameters were
measured every day by blood sample analyses and capnography
was used continuously. Every patient was sedated and ventilated
(Vc: 6 ml/kg; rate: 12/min; PEEP 5 ± 3 mmHg) by the same
approach. The study stopped on day 4 at the beginning of enteral
nutrition. For statistical analysis, a Shapiro–Wilk test, a Wilcox test
and a Student t test were used.
Results The ratio between the total energy intake and the energy
expenditure was similar in both groups (Og: 0.75 ± 0.17; Ng:
0.86 ± 0.26, P = 0.24). The nitrogen balance was negative for all
patients and showed no significant difference (P = 0.08). The daily
amino supply showed no significant difference (Og: 0.7 ± 0.2; Ng:
0.8 ± 0.2 kcal/kg; P = 0.17).
The daily glucose intake was similar in both groups, but with a
lower significant trend in Og showing a more stable glucose/
insulin ratio (P < 0.05) with a significant lower average PCO2
production (Og: 38 ± 5 mmHg; Ng: 68 ± 12 mmHg) (P < 0.01).
The daily lipid intake was higher in Og (Og: 0.8 ± 0.3; Ng:
0.5 ± 0.1 g/kg; P < 0.001). The ratio triglyceride/cholesterol level
was not different between groups. No fat emboly occurred in all
the study population. Infection rates where similar in both groups.
Conclusion The main purpose for controlling stress oxidation is to
diminish eicosanoide production [1]. By modifying the n-6/n-3 ratio
in new parenteral solution we can protect the cellular membrane
and promote a glucose/insulin ratio stability avoiding also further
CO2 production.

with conventional lipid emulsions led to a better utilisation of the
lipids.
Methods A prospective randomized study. After approval of the
ethical committee, 45 postoperative surgical patients with an
indication for parenteral nutrition therapy were included in the
study. Nonprotein calories were given as 60% glucose and 40%
lipid emulsion. The total energy intake per day was 25 kcal/kg body
weight. Sedation regimen was standardized. Patients were divided
into three groups: Group A (n = 15) received structured TGs
(Structolipid® 20%), group B (n = 15) received a MCT/LCT
physical mixture (Lipofundin® 20%) and group C (n = 15) received
a pure LCT lipid emulsion (Lipovenoes® 20%). Lipid emulsions
were administered for 5 days postoperatively, corresponding to the
observation time. TG levels were measured before the start of
infusion (d0), at day 1 (d1), day 2 (d2), day 3 (d3) and day 5 (d5)
after the start of infusion. The significance level was defined at
P < 0.05.
Results There were no significant differences in TG levels at d1
and d2, whereas at d3 and d5 the TG levels in group A (d3:
140 ± 31 mg/dl; d5 134 ± 36 mg/dl) were significantly lower than
in group B (d3: 220 ± 91 mg/dl; d5 177 ± 52 mg/dl) and group C
(d3: 239 ± 136 mg/dl; d5 256 ± 156 mg/dl).
Conclusions The administration of structured lipid emulsions
within a parenteral nutrition regimen led at d3 and d5 of the
nutrition regimen to significantly reduced TG levels compared with
a MCT/LCT physical mixture or a pure LCT lipid emulsion.

Immunonutrition with eicosapentaenoic acid and
γγ-linolenic acid as a new strategy to reduce mortality and
improve outcomes in patients with severe sepsis

Introduction Enteral diets enriched with EPA (fish oil), GLA
(borage oil) and elevated levels of antioxidant vitamins are capable
of ameliorating several outcomes in patients with ARDS. Several
studies using animal models of sepsis point towards a possible
role of enteral nutrition enriched with omega-3 fatty acids in the
reduction of mortality.
Hypothesis This study investigates whether an enteral diet
enriched with EPA, GLA and elevated levels of antioxidants can
improve outcomes and reduce 28-day all-cause mortality in patients
with severe sepsis or septic shock under mechanical ventilation.
Methods This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized trial. One hundred and sixty-five patients with either
severe sepsis or septic shock were enrolled. Patients were
randomized and continuously tube-fed either EPA, GLA and
elevated antioxidants or a control diet isonitrogenous and isocaloric
to the study diet and delivered to achieve a minimum of 75% of
basal energy expenditure × 1.3 during a minimum of 4 days.
Results Septic patients fed EPA, GLA and elevated antioxidants
showed a significant reduction in mortality rate, with an absolute
reduction of 19.4% (P = 0.037). The EPA+GLA-fed group also
presented significant improvements in oxygenation status from
baseline to study days 4 and 7, more ventilator-free days (13.4 vs
5.8, P < 0.001), more ICU-free days (10.8 vs 4.6, P < 0.001) and
significantly less development of new organ dysfunctions during
the follow-up period (P < 0.001).
Conclusions An enteral formulation enriched with EPA, GLA and
elevated antioxidants can contribute to better ICU and hospital
outcomes, and is also associated with lower mortality rates of
septic patients under mechanical ventilation. The beneficial effects
of this diet suggest that this enteral nutrition formula would be a
useful adjuvant therapy in the clinical management of sepsis.

Introduction Septic patients have reduced plasma arginine (ARG)
levels, and have been considered ARG deficient. This has resulted
in the use of ARG-enriched enteral formulas, which recently raised
much concern. These formulas, however, also contain other
components besides ARG. ARG is the precursor for nitric oxide, a
known vasodilator. Since little is known about the haemodynamic
effects of continuous i.v. ARG supplementation as a single
component in sepsis, we aimed to study dose–response effects of
ARG in severe septic patients.
Methods Eight ICU patients with severe sepsis/septic shock
(<48 hours) were included. APACHE II scores ranged between 27
and 43. Norepinephrine dose ranged between 0.05 and
0.8 µg/kg/min. After 2 hours baseline, L-ARG-HCl was infused
continuously in three stepwise increased doses (0.6, 1.2 and
1.8 µmol/kg/min), each dose for 2 hours. Haemodynamics were
recorded at 30-min intervals. Plasma arginine levels were analysed
by HPLC. Repeated-measurements ANOVA was used to compare
doses; data are means ± SEM.
Results No significant changes in systemic blood pressure were
observed. Compared with plasma ARG levels of age-matched
healthy subjects (81 ± 5 µM), levels were reduced in our patients
(P < 0.05). The heart rate decreased during ARG supplementation
and the stroke volume increased (Table 1).

Conclusions ARG infusion does not affect systemic and
pulmonary blood pressure, but increases the cardiac stroke
volume. This indicates that continuous ARG supplementation does
not deteriorate the haemodynamic condition in severe septic
patients, despite its vasodilating effect.

treatments for these patients, improving body protein and immune
function, reducing the rate of infection and shortening hospitalization.
In this study, we administered intravenous glutamine supplemen-
tation to patients with SIRS in order to investigate the effect of
glutamine supplementation on immune states.
This study is a prospective, randomized clinical trial. The APACHE
II score and the SAPS II were used to evaluate the patients after
admission. All patients received total parenteral nutrition (TPN)
given continuously during 6 days. Thirty patients with SIRS were
allocated to either a glutamine group (L-glutamine 0.4 g/kg/day) or
a control group (glutamine-free, isonitrogenous, isocaloric formula).
Blood samples were collected on day 1 and day 6 after admission
for C-reactive protein, IgM, IgG, IgA, C3, C4 and lymphocyte
analysis.
Although there was tendency to decrease T-sitotoxic cells and
natural killer cells in the control group, no significant difference was
observed between the two groups. However, an increase in
lymphocyte and lymphocyte subgroups in the glutamine group was
observed but there was no difference between groups. A low
SAPS II was observed on the sixth day in the glutamine group
whereas no difference in SAPS II and the APACHE II score were
observed between the two groups.
The administration of TPN supplemented with glutamine causes
enhancement in T-cell function in SIRS patients.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P210 (doi: 10.1186/cc4557)
Background Malnourished elective major surgery patients are not
routinely given nutrition support (NS) preoperatively in the
Philippines owing to financial constraints and lack of evidence of
benefit in the local patient population. Such patients frequently
develop postoperative complications that may necessitate
admission to the ICU. This pilot study was conducted to
demonstrate the benefit of NS in such patients in terms of reduced
ICU admissions.
Methods Thirty-six malnourished and lymphopenic elective
abdominal surgical patients (BMI <18.5 kg/m2 or weight loss
>10% or SGA grade C) were given NS preoperatively for 5 days
without (n = 18, group A) or with (n = 18, group B) parenteral
glutamine. NS was given orally, enterally or parenterally in
combinations to ensure delivery of energy 25–30 kcal/kg/day and
of proteins 0.8–1.5 g/kg/day. For ethical reasons at the research
centres, a control group (no NS) was not included.
Results Postoperatively, only one (2.7%) patient required ICU
admission. Compared with historical data in similar patients (>20%
incidence; P < 0.05) the difference was significant. Complications
included one (2.7%) each of wound infection, respiratory infection
and wound dehiscence. Unlike group A, group B showed
significant (P < 0.05) increases in granulocyte, lymphocyte and
monocyte counts, which returned to normal at 7 days post-
operation. See Table 1.
Conclusions Preoperative NS resulted in a reduction in
postoperative complications requiring ICU admission, at least in
comparison with historical data of similar patients at the same
institutions. Addition of glutamine to NS resulted in indicative
immunologic benefits that may be worth further exploration.

Objectives To study the prevalence of malnutrition in surgical
patients. To identify the patients at risk of early postoperative
wound infection. To observe the pattern of wound healing in
various groups of surgical patients based on their preoperative
nutritional status.
Design A descriptive study in the surgical department at Jinnah
Hospital Lahore, Pakistan.
Participants One hundred patients presenting to surgical OPD
since 1 January 2001.
Methods Serum albumin levels and the BMI of these patients were
evaluated and patients were assigned to a group according to their
nutritional status.
Main outcome measures Adding all patients in groups II, III, and
IV and dividing by the total number of patients in the study
determined the prevalence of malnutrition. Wounds of all patients
were examined on the third postoperative day and the wound
category was recorded. Wound infection was observed in various
nutritional status groups.
Results The prevalence of malnutrition in surgical patients is 70%.
Wound infection was present in all groups of patients except
group I. Patients in groups II and IV had more severe wound
infection.
Conclusions Malnutrition is common in surgical patients.
Hypoalbuminemia is associated with increased risk of early
postoperative wound infection. The BMI has no direct effect on
early postoperative wound infection. Further studies are needed to
explore the role of other parameters of nutritional assessment on
early postoperative wound infection in patients with different
demographic factors.

Introduction The impact of synbiotics on enteral feeding tolerance
and immune function has been studied. We designed a protocol
monitoring impact of synbiotics on these variables in long-term ICU
patients.
Patients and methods Patients estimated on D1 (D0 = admission)
to stay in the ICU >3 days were randomized (according to age,
sex, SOFA score and diagnosis group) to postpyloric placebo (tea)
or treatment (Synbiotic) groups. Monocyte function was monitored
on D1 and then at 5-day intervals; enteral nutrition (EN) was given
according to the standard ICU protocol.
Preliminary analysis of early development (D1–D5–D10) of
CD14+HLADR+ expression and tolerance of enteral feeding is
reported. Data are presented as the median (Q25; Q75).
Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA and Wilcoxon tests were used when
appropriate, P < 0.05 considered significant.
Results Twelve patients (10 male, two female; age 54 [39; 63]
years) were randomized and 11 were eligible for analysis
(Synbiotic n = 6, placebo n = 5). Ten patients survived the ICU
stay (S), and one did not (NS). The APACHE II score on admission
was 22 (21; 26.5). The course of CD14+HLADR+ did not differ in
the Synbiotic/placebo groups (Table 1). In two placebo and no
Synbiotic patients a significant drop of 15% was measured. The
amount of EN (10 days) is higher in the Synbiotic than the placebo
group (6930 ml [6490; 7292] vs 5010 ml [4747; 5237],
P < 0.05), as was the frequency of stool (9 [4; 14] vs 1 [0; 4],
P = 0.13).

Conclusion Preliminary data do not show a major impact of
synbiotics on monocyte function. Tolerance of EN seems to be

The effect of enteral synbiotics on the incidence of
ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically
ventilated critically ill patients

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P213 (doi: 10.1186/cc4560)
Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) affects
between 8% and 28% [1] of mechanically ventilated patients. A
novel way of reducing the incidence of VAP may be the use of
enteral synbiotics. Synbiotics may reduce VAP directly (reducing
pathogenic organisms in the proximal gut) or indirectly (improving
host immunity) [2].
Objective To determine the effect of enteral Synbiotic 2000
FORTE® (a mixture of lactic acid bacteria and fibre) on the
incidence of VAP in critically ill patients.
Design A prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial in the 14-bed general ICU of a UK university hospital.
Participants Mechanically ventilated, enterally fed, critically ill
patients were recruited over a 13-month period.
Methods Patients were enterally fed as per the ICU protocol and
were randomly assigned to receive either synbiotic 2000 FORTE®
(twice a day) or a cellulose-based placebo, throughout the ICU
stay. Oropharyngeal swabs were obtained on days 0, 4 and 7.
Measurements and results The treatment group (n = 130) was
well matched with the placebo group (n = 129) for age (median 53
and 50 years) and APACHE II score (median 17 for both).
Oropharyngeal microbial flora and colonization rates were
unaffected by synbiotics. The overall incidence of VAP was lower
than anticipated (11.2%) and no statistical difference was
demonstrated between synbiotic or placebo in the incidence of
VAP (9% and 13%, P = 0.31), VAP rate per 1000 ventilator-days
(13 and 14.6, P = 0.73) or hospital mortality (27% and 33%,
P = 0.32), respectively.
Conclusions The incidence of VAP and mortality were not
significantly decreased by the administration of Synbiotic 2000
FORTE®. These preliminary data indicate that synbiotics are
unlikely to be harmful, although trends to benefit suggest a larger
multicentre study may be warranted.

Introduction In critical illness, nasogastric (NG) feeding is
frequently compromised by delayed gastric emptying. This is
usually treated by administration of prokinetics, such as
metoclopramide or erythromycin. Data on the relative and individual
effects of these agents, in critically ill patients, are limited. In
addition, erythromycin has been reported to cause hypotension,
which could compromise splanchnic perfusion.
Objectives To compare metoclopramide (M) and erythromycin (E)
in the initial treatment of feed intolerance in critical illness, to
determine the success of combination treatment in patients who
fail to respond to a single agent, and to examine the effect of E on
blood pressure (BP).
Methods Ninety feed-intolerant (6-hourly NG aspirate >250 ml)
mechanically ventilated patients (mean APACHE II score =
21.4 ± 0.6) were randomly allocated to receive either M (n = 45;
10 mg i.v. four times daily) or E (n = 45; 200 mg i.v. twice daily) in
a prospective, double-blind randomized fashion. Age, sex,
APACHE II scores and initial gastric residual volumes were similar
between the two groups. After the first dose of prokinetic therapy,
NG feeding was restarted at 40 ml/hour and increased in a
standardized fashion and 6-hourly NG aspirates were performed. If
NG aspirate >250 ml recurred, combination therapy was
commenced. Patients were studied for 7 days. The BP was
recorded.

Results Inotrope, opioid and benzodiazepine usage, and blood
glucose concentrations were similar in the two groups. After
24 hours of treatment, both M and E significantly reduced 24-hour
gastric residual volumes (M: 830 ± 32 ml to 435 ± 30 ml,
P < 0.0001; E: 798 ± 33 ml to 201 ± 19 ml, P < 0.0001) and
improved the proportion of patients with successful feeding (no
aspirate >250 ml; M: 62% and E: 87%). Treatment with E was
more effective than with M (P < 0.05). The effectiveness of both
treatments on subsequent days declined rapidly. In patients who
failed single-agent therapy, combination therapy was highly
effective (day 1, 92%) and its effectiveness was maintained for the
duration of the study (day 6, 77%). Predictors of poor response to
single or combined prokinetic therapy included increased age,
APACHE II score, pretreatment gastric residual volume, trauma,
and abnormal renal function. E caused a nonsignificant reduction in
systolic BP (+1.0 ± 0.9 vs –3.6 ± 0.9 mmHg, P = NS) and
diastolic BP (–0.1 ± 0.9 vs –1.7 ± 1.1 mmHg, P = NS).
Conclusions Erythromycin is safe and more effective than
metoclopramide in treating feed intolerance in critical illness;
however, rapid tolerance occurs to both agents when used
individually. In patients who develop feed intolerance on a single
agent, combination therapy is effective with little evidence of
tolerance. The role of combined therapy as initial treatment
requires further evaluation.

Introduction Nutritional support is vital to improving the clinical
outcomes in patients on the ICU. Enteral nutrition should be
administered early and aggressively, thereby reducing the need for
parenteral nutrition (TPN). Nasogastric (NG) feeding may not be
tolerated due to gastroparesis, small and large bowel ileus
associated with drugs and/or surgery.
Objectives We hypothesised that if NG feeding was not tolerated
within 24 hours, following suitable use of prokinetics, then a self-
propelling nasojejunal (NJ) tube (Tiger Tube [TT tube]; Wilson
Cook, USA) would be placed and NJ feeding commenced
reducing TPN requirements.
Design A prospective observational study.
Methods We prospectively monitored patients with NG feeding
intolerance. If enteral feed was not tolerated, patients were
commenced on prokinetic agents (metaclopramide 10 mg three
times daily i.v. and or erythromycin 250 mg i.v.). Despite prokinetic
therapy, if still intolerant a TT tube was placed. One hour pre-TT and
4 hours post-TT placement patients received erythromycin (500 mg
i.v.). The TT tube was placed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. (The NG tube was also left in situ for aspirate assessment.)
Abdominal X-ray was performed 6 hours after initiation of TT
placement to confirm location and NJ feeding commenced.
Results NJ feeding was commenced promptly on medical and
surgical patients intolerant of standard NG feeding, and placement
of the TT tube was successful (35/40 patients, 87.5%). Estimated
savings in patient days of TPN have been illustrated in Table 1
(n = 40).
Conclusion The TTs were easily placed aided by prokinetics
(87.5%). All tubes were placed by the nurse/doctor at the bedside
and did not require endoscopic placement. Significant financial
and manpower resources have been saved by a simple bedside
technique. No clinical complications were noted with the use of TT
tubes in our study. A randomised study is now planned.

Introduction More than 80% of ICU patients are fed enterally via
nasogastric or nasoenteric tubes. Incorrect placement of these
tubes, however, can have fatal consequences for these patients.
Several methods have been used to ensure proper placement of the
nasogastric tube before starting enteral feeding. Our aim was to
estimate the value of bedside sonography (ATL, ultramark9) in
confirming the position of a common radio-opaque nasogastric tube
(NG-Levin) and compare this procedure with simple radiography.
Methods A prospective study in a five-bed ICU over a 5-month
period from May to September 2005. Confirmation of the
nasogastric tube position was made by sonographically identifying
the air bubble that comes out of the Levin after injecting a 10 cm3
mixture of 5% dextrose and air as well as by standard radiography.
All NG tubes where inserted by the same individual. The success
and the accuracy of the procedure, as well as the procedure times
for both sonography and radiography, were recorded and
compared. The APACHE score was estimated for every patient.
Results Sixteen patients were included in the study, nine of them
men and seven women, with a mean age of 66.3 ± 7.1 years and a
mean APACHE II score of 21 ± 5.2. All patients were intubated
and mechanically ventilated. The nasogastric tube position was
confirmed sonographically in 15 out of 16 patients. In one case the
ultrasound failed to produce results due to gas interposition. The
nasogastric tube position was also confirmed radiographically. The
median procedure time was 14.93 ± 1.71 min for sonography and
84 ± 30.64 min for radiography (P < 0.001). No case of
mispositioning occurred.
Conclusion Bedside sonography is a sensitive method for
confirming the position of nasogastric tube. It is easy to perform by
ICU physicians, it is an easy procedure to be learned and it is
quicker than conventional radiography.

Introduction The risk of a severe malnutrition is particularly high in
critically ill patients. On the other hand, to administer feeding
overcoming the metabolic need should be considered a significant
risk factor and not a useful approach in improving the outcome of
ICU patients. To this purpose, a hypocaloric nutritional support has
been proposed. It may satisfy the patient’s caloric–proteic needs,
and supply energy enough aimed to avoid the adverse effects of
the stress-related metabolic response. The present study aimed to
evaluate the nutritional support management in our ICU, and to
assess the relative role of the enteral nutritional therapy on
morbidity.
Methods One hundred and fifty-one out of 194 adult patients
admitted to our polyvalent ICU from 1 January 2005 to 30
September 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients younger
than 18 years, those requiring a length of stay less than 3 days,
patients with an ideal body weight >30%, and those on
parenteral nutritional therapy were excluded from the study. The
enteral nutritional support contained 55% carbohydrates, 30%
lipids and 15% proteins, and was administered by means of
either a nasogastric or orogastric probe. The estimated total
caloric need for each patient was calculated with the
Harris–Benedict formula. The correction factor of 1.2 was used
for patients admitted to the ICU after severe head injury.
Multivariate and receiver–operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analyses were applied.
Results The daily average of theoretical kcals provided was
26.4 ± 6 kcals, with respect to 21.8 ± 3.4 kcals actually adminis-
tered. Only 22% of patients received the amount of 90% of the
theoretically calculated kcals. The ROC analysis identified a
threshold of 70% for the theoretical/administered nutritional
support ratio (T/A-NSR) value related to morbidity (the area under
curve was 0.76; 95% CI = 0.681–0.843, P < 0.05). By using the
threshold of 70% for the T/A-NSR value, we were able to split our
patient population into two groups: group A, patients receiving a
T/A-NSR value ≤70%, and group B receiving a T/A-NSR value
>70%. The statistical analysis showed that morbidity, duration of
mechanical ventilation, and ICU length of stay were higher in group
A (P < 0.05).
Conclusion Our findings showed that administering a lower
nutritional support (i.e. hypocaloric nutritional support) than the
theoretically calculated calories is associated with increased
morbidity. However, hyponutrition should be considered not only
a direct risk factor for morbidity, but a result of bad outcomes. In
fact, gastrointestinal problems often occur in critically ill
patients, and the enteral nutrition may not be sufficiently
adequate. In such cases, the only alternative to enteral nutrition
is total parenteral nutrition. In conclusion, proof that limiting the
hyponutrition improves outcomes in this setting awaits a sound
prospective goal-oriented trial investigating one or more
strategies to improve the nutritional management of the critically
ill patient.

Introduction Nutritional status has been associated with several
outcomes in critically ill patients, including prolonged ventilatory
dependence, increased infection rate, prolonged ICU length of
stay (ICU LOS) and mortality.
Objective To study the influence of several markers of nutritional
status on ICU LOS and mortality.
Methods An observational study regarding several nutritional
markers (serum albumin, nitrogen balance and caloric deficit)
routinely recorded on our ICU and their association with ICU LOS
and mortality. Appropriate descriptive statistics are presented
Comparisons between groups were performed using the chi-
square test, Student’s t test or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney
U test or Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate. Analysis of the
association between nutritional markers and mortality, estimated by
the OR, unadjusted and adjusted for sex and SAPS II, were
calculated using logistic regression. Multiple logistic regression
modelling was performed, using the stepwise forward method, with
mortality as the dependent variable and age, sex, nutritional
markers and ICU variables (reason for ICU admission, SAPS II, ICU
LOS) as independent variables. For the analysis of ICU LOS, and
because of the right skewness of its distribution, a logarithmic
transformation of this variable was used. Simple and multiple linear
regression models were then used to study the association
between nutritional and other factors and the ICU LOS, with the
log-transformation of ICU LOS as the dependent variable. For
hypothesis testing a value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0® software
package.
Results Ninety-one patients were included, of which 53 were
male; mean age was 62 years. The reason for admission was
medical in 68 patients, surgical in 16 patients and trauma in seven
patients. The mean SAPS II was 45 and the median ICU LOS was
11 days. Patients surviving, patients with serum albumin lower than
2.5 g/dl, and those with a caloric deficit higher than –500 kcal/day
exhibit a significantly shorter ICU LOS. In the linear regression
model, however, these variables were no longer significantly
associated with ICU LOS. Severity of illness (SAPS II) (OR 1.052;
95% CI 1.014; 1.091), nitrogen balance (OR 1.115; 95% CI
1.013; 1.228) and the need for parenteral nutrition plus enteral
nutrition (OR 6.255; 95% CI 1.277; 30.645), were significantly
associated with mortality in the logistic regression model. Caloric
deficit was also significantly associated with mortality after
adjustment for sex and SAPS II.
Conclusion Nutrition markers were associated with a longer ICU
stay and a higher mortality. This hypothesis should be evaluated
with more appropriate methodological approaches.

Introduction Critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPM) is the
leading cause of failure to wean in ICU patients without
concomitant cardiorespiratory disease, resulting in a prolonged
ICU stay and increased morbidity and mortality.
Objectives To estimate the epidemiologic characteristics of CIPM
in a general ICU and to investigate the risk factors.
Patients and methods We prospectively evaluated 474 (323 male/
151 female, age 55 ± 19 years) consecutive patients from August
2004 to September 2005 who were admitted to a general ICU
and stayed for >24 hours. All patients were assigned admission
APACHE II (15 ± 19) and SOFA (6 ± 3) scores and were
subsequently evaluated for newly developed neuromuscular
weakness. We examined muscle strength according to the Medical
Research Council scale, deep tendon reflexes, sensory function
and muscle wasting. Laboratory values and medical therapy were
recorded daily. Other potential causes of new-onset generalized
weakness after ICU admission were excluded before the diagnosis
of CIPM was established.
Results Fifty (11%) out of 474 patients developed generalized
weakness that met the criteria for CIPM. Patients with CIPM had a
higher admission APACHE II score (19 ± 7 vs 14 ± 7, P < 0.001),
SOFA score (8 ± 3 vs 6 ± 3, P < 0.001) and a higher mortality
rate (30% vs 18%, P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression
showed that risk factors independently associated with the
development of CIPM were the duration of hypoproteinemia and
APACHE II score during admission at the ICU. Other factors
studied were the SOFA score at admission, use of inotropic and
pressor agents, duration of enteral and parenteral nutrition,
administration of colistin and the development of ventilator-
associated pneumonia.
Conclusions CIPM has a high incidence in the general ICU
population. The severity of illness and persistent hypoproteinemia
are associated with an increased risk of the development of CIPM.

Introduction Acute gastroduodenal stress disorder-related ulcer is
a major problem for treatment in patients with generalized
peritonitis. Numerous studies have tried to identify some of the risk
factors for stress ulcer formation in patients with peritonitis. The
aim of this study was to investigate the most important changes of
the immune system and neuroimmune interactions for the
prognosis of the risk for stress gastroduodenal ulcer formation in
patients with acute generalized peritonitis.
Methods We studied prospectively 320 patients aged 18–86 with
acute generalized peritonitis of different etiology after an
emergency operation. All patients were treated with broad-
spectrum antibiotics and supportive therapy. Blood was collected
1, 3, 7 and 14 days after operation to determine lymphocyte
subsets, plasma concentrations of IgA, IgM, IgG, and
neuroreceptors (β-adrenoreceptors and cholinoreceptors) on the
surface of lymphocytes.
Results Although most patients with acute peritonitis (94%) did
not demonstrate clinical signs of ulcer, the incidence of stress
ulcer was significantly higher (32% in nonsurvivors). Our findings
revealed four types of neuroimmune interactions in patients with
generalized peritonitis. Type I — patients (only 8% of patients) with
active adrenoreceptors and cholinoreceptors; type II — patients
(61%) with active cholinoreceptors in combination with blockade
of β-adrenoreceptors on the surface of sensitized lymphocytes;
type III — patients (16%) with active β-adrenoreceptors in
combination with blockade of cholinoreceptors; type IV — patients
(15%) with blockade of both β-adrenoreceptors and
cholinoreceptors. Among the patients with proinflammatory
complications in the postoperative period we observed mostly the
III (40%) and IV (34%) types of neuroimmune interactions; and
among the patients with an uncomplicated course of the
postoperative period, type II (62%). In patients with stress ulcer
formation in the postoperative period we diagnosed II and IV types
of neuroimmune interactions. The index of stimulation of β-
adrenoreceptors activity by adrenaline was decreased to
1.7 ± 0.09, and the index of stimulation of cholinoreceptors on the
surface of lymphocytes by carbocholine was normal (1.62 ± 0.09
in type II) or below the normal level (0.8 ± 0.07). We did not reveal
stress gastroduodenal ulcers in patients with I and III types of
neuroimmune interactions.
Conclusions Dysfunction of neuroimmune interactions may explain a
proneness towards weaker defense and formation of the stress
disorder-related acute gastroduodenal ulcer. One of the contributing
factors to the development of the stress ulcer in patients with acute
generalized peritonitis is the condition of β-adrenoreceptors and
cholinoreceptors on the surface of the lymphocytes.

Objective In our study, we aimed to compare the effects of proton
pump inhibitors in ICU patients with a control group for:
hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure),
hematologic parameters, gastric intramucosal pH, gastric volume,
gastric pH, duration of stay in the ICU and mortality.
Materials and methods Seventy-five patients were included in our
study. Cases of Group C (n = 15) were given only 100 ml serum
physiologic, cases of Group O (n = 15) were given 20 mg omepra-
zole, cases of Group P (n = 15) were given 40 mg pantoprazole,
cases of Group E (n = 15) were given 20 mg esomeprazole, and
cases of Group R (n = 15) were given 20 mg rabeprazole from
nasogastric with 100 ml serum physiologic. Demographic findings,
the duration of stay in the ICU and mortality were recorded in all
groups. Before any medicine was given, and after giving the
medicine, in the second, fourth and sixth hours, the gastric pH,
gastric volume, gastric intramucosal pH, hemodynamic parameters,
and PaO2 were recorded. Before any medicine was given, and
after giving the medicine, in the second, fourth and 24th hours,
hematologic parameters were recorded.

S93
Results There were no differences regarding demographic
findings, duration of stay in the ICU, mortality, hemodynamic
parameters, hematologic parameters, gastric intramucosal pH, and
PaO2 between all groups. The initial gastric volume and gastric pH
values were not statistically significantly different between all
groups. In the second, fourth and sixth hours, after giving medicine,
in the pantoprazole, esomeprazole and rabeprazole groups the
gastric pH increased and the gastric volume decreased statistically
significantly compared with the omeprazole and control groups. In
the gastric volume and gastric pH values, changes in the
pantoprazole, esomeprazole and rabeprazole groups were not
statistically significantly different between these groups.
Conclusion The proton pump inhibitors pantoprazole, esomepra-
zole and rabeprazole were more effective in increasing the gastric
pH and decreasing the gastric volume than omeprazole. In all the
proton pump inhibitors we used, there were no effects on the
gastric intramucosal pH.

Stress ulcer prophylaxis is one of the most common medications
used in the intensive care setting. Despite well-established risk factors
and guidelines, most critical care physicians use prophylaxis therapy
inappropriately. In the absence of a standard of care, we evaluated
the efficacy, safety, and potential cost savings of an evidence-based
stress ulcer prophylaxis protocol in the surgical ICU (SICU).
We conducted a prospective, clinical study at a tertiary care
teaching hospital in Chicago. One hundred and nine patients
admitted to the SICU were screened daily for 12 risk factors of
stress ulceration and followed until discharge from the unit.
Patients with at least one identified risk factor were started on
famotidine. Prophylaxis was discontinued when risk factors were
no longer present and/or the patient tolerated at least 50% of
his/her daily caloric need. Data collected included patient
demographics, daily risk factor assessment, number of doses
received, nutritional intake, estimated creatinine clearance, and
adverse outcomes. Comparison data was collected for the 109
patients admitted to the SICU prior to the adoption of our protocol.
Of the 109 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 99 required stress
ulcer prophylaxis per our protocol. The most common risk factors
were major cardiovascular or abdominal operation within 48 hours,
mechanical ventilation greater than 48 hours, and intolerance to
enteral feeding. A comparison of pre-protocol versus post-protocol
implementation revealed an average SICU length of stay of 5.2 vs
8 days (P = 0.003), an average duration of prophylaxis therapy of 5
vs 4 days (P = 0.02), and an average number of doses
administered per patient of 8.6 vs 5.7 (P = 0.001), respectively.
This translated into a cost difference per patient of $4.53 vs $3.84
(P = 0.02). Efficacy and safety analysis revealed six adverse drug
reactions, with one treatment failure documented by a clinically
significant bleed requiring transfusion (0.92% incidence), and five
incidents of thrombocytopenia (0.01% incidence) for which
famotidine could not be ruled out as a causative agent. These
findings are consistent with previously established adverse
reactions associated with histamine-2 receptor blockers.
Pantoprazole was subsequently initiated in all six cases.
Our midpoint data analysis suggests that our evidence-based
protocol is a safe and efficacious tool for the standardization of
stress ulcer prophylaxis in an ICU. Although potential cost savings
may be minimal, the reduction of unnecessary medication
administration, prevention of potential drug–drug interactions, and
recognition of patient risk factors through the use of a stress ulcer
prophylaxis protocol are achieved.

Background Excessive postoperative bleeding (>1 l/24 hours)
and transfusion requirements for major cardiac surgical inter-
ventions vary widely. Factors such as preoperative status and
medication, cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), activation of
coagulation, fibrinolysis and complement all play a determinant role
in postoperative bleeding.
Objective To determine the incidence and host factors associated
with EB in CPB patients without antifibrinolytic prophylaxis.
Patients and methods We performed a cross-sectional study of
26 patients (15 men; mean age 64.5 years, SD 1.4), from a clinical
trial of 50 CPB patients, who did not receive antifibrinolytic
prophylaxis. Surgery performed was: 12 CABG, 10 valvular
replacement and four patients underwent both procedures.
Variables were collected preoperatively, at ICU admission, and at 4
and 24 hours after surgery. The associations of excessive bleeding
with demographic, clinical and genetic factors were analyzed. We
used SPSS-12.2 software for statistical purposes.
Results The incidence of excessive bleeding (EB) was 50%. BMI
<26.4 (25–28) was associated with EB (P = 0.026). Preoperative
levels of leptins (P = 0.059) and PAI-1 (P = 0.014) were
predictors for EB. Body temperature <30.7 (30–32)ºC during
CPB (P = 0.037) and at ICU admission (P = 0.029) was
associated with EB. We found greater activation at admission of
C1q (P = 0.019), C1-inhibitor (P = 0.029) and B factor
(P = 0.005), C7 (P = 0.005), with lower levels of PAI-1 (P < 0.001),
prothrombin time (PT) (P = 0.039), leptins (P = 0.014) and
leptin/BMI (P = 0.019) in those patients with EB. In the same
patients at 4 hours, we found lower levels of C1q (P = 0.004), C1-
inhibitor (P = 0.046), C3 (P = 0.010), B factor (P = 0.016), C7
(P = 0.004), PT (P = 0.034), leptins (P = 0.004) and leptin/BMI
(P = 0.011). In addition lower levels at 24 hours of C1q (P = 0.039),
leptins (P = 0.005) and leptin/BMI (P = 0.003) were found in
patients with EB. These patients showed a hyperdynamic state and
greater transfusion requirements.
We observed a statistically significant positive correlation between
the complement system (alternative and final pathway: C3, B factor
and C7) and the following variables: sTNF, PAI, PT and leptins;
and an inverse correlation with bleeding.
Conclusion The incidence of excessive bleeding was 50%;
coagulation, fibrinolysis, complement and inflammation parameters
were involved. Our results suggest that patients admitted with low
BMI, PAI and leptins together with higher activation of the
complement system had greater transfusion requirements over 24
hours.

Ospedale M. Bufalini, Cesena, Italy
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P224 (doi: 10.1186/cc4571)
Introduction Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) increased in active upper
gastrointestinal bleeding. The relationship between BUN and
endoscopic pattern is not fully investigated.
Patients and methods From January 2001 to October 2004, 157
(male/female, 123/34; mean age 69.3 years) were admitted to our
hospital because of signs of gastrointestinal bleeding (hemathe-
mesis and/or melaena). At admission to the Emergency
Department, haemodynamics parameters (cardiac rate, arterial
pressure) and laboratory blood tests (complete blood count,
creatinine, electrolyte, BUN, albumin) were measured. All patients
underwent endoscopy within 8 hours and Forrest’s criteria for
gastrointestinal bleeding were used: F1, active bleeding; F2, signs
of recent bleeding (clot); F3, healing ulcer. During hospitalization,
the history, past treatment, haemotransfusion, rebleeding and
surgical treatment were also recorded. Data were analyzed in a
statistical manner and t tests for unpaired data and univariate
analysis were performed.
Results Among 157 upper gastrointestinal bleeding cases, 128
were peptic ulcer and classified, according to Forrest’s criteria, as:
23 F1, 61 F2 and 44 F3. Bleeding recurrence occurred in 10/128
(7.7%); no patients underwent surgery. There was a significant
difference between the three groups for: number of blood units
transfused, BUN, BUN/creatinine ratio, systolic blood pressure,
and length of hospital stay (P < 0.05) (see also Table 1).
Conclusion BUN levels and the BUN/creatinine ratio correlate
with Forrest’s different ulcer patterns. These could identify patients
who need an early endoscopic evaluation and more intensive
treatment.

Background The incidence of excessive postoperative bleeding
and transfusion requirements for major cardiac surgical inter-
ventions varies between 10% and 70%. Not all the mechanisms
involved are as yet understood.
Objective To investigate the possible role of several genetic
polymorphisms associated with coagulation, fibrinolysis and inflam-
mation, in patients with excessive bleeding after elective cardio-
pulmonary bypass (CPB).
Patients and methods We performed a cross-sectional study of 26
patients, from a clinical trial of 50 CPB patients, who did not receive
antifibrinolytic prophylaxis. For these patients we recorded clinical
variables associated with bleeding, and the following polymor-
phisms: insertion/deletion (I/D) of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
gene; G1691A of the Leiden factor gene; G20210A of the factor II
gene; 4G/5G of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1); Alu repeat
I/D of the plasminogen tissular activator (tPA) gene; and finally the
first intron of TNF-β (TNF-β +250). In addition, seven neutral markers
were genotyped to follow genomic control strategies that would
detect spurious associations due to population substructure [1]. The
neutral markers chosen are biallelic Alu repeats distributed in different
chromosomes. We used SPSS-12.2 software for statistical purposes.
Results Greater bleeding in the 24-hour postoperative period was
associated with: ACE (DD: 891 [SD 531] ml; ID: 512 [SD 458] ml,
II: 1125 [SD 735] ml; P = 0.046), TNF-β +250 (AA: 747 [SD 459]

PAI-1 (4G/4G: 792 [SD 477] ml; 4G/5G: 554 [SD 376] ml;
5G/5G: 1036 [SD 694] ml; P = 0.037). Homozygous 5G showed
lower levels of PAI-1 (36.98 [7.68] vs 120.3 [14.3], P = 0.02), lower
levels of leptins preoperatively (11.15 [2.15] vs 25.56 [3.93], P =
0.016), at admission (3.54 [0.84] vs 18.67 [3.72], P = 0.02), and at
4 hours (3.43 [1.12] vs 15.48 [3.27], P < 0.001) and 24 hours
postoperatively (11.12 [4.36] vs 29.57 [4.82], P = 0.013) and
greater coagulation factors consumed. Those patients achieved a
greater advantage of antifibrinolytic prophylaxis with tranexamic acid.
Conclusion We found three polymorphisms associated with exces-
sive postoperative bleeding. This may enable us to identify patients
at risk before CPB intervention and to optimize prophylactic therapy.

systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). We evaluated the
efficacy of tranexamic acid (TA) for SIRS and postoperative bleeding.
Patients and methods We performed a prospective, randomized,
double-blind controlled study of 50 consecutive patients who
underwent elective CPB. Twenty-four patients received TA, and 26
received saline solution before and after CPB. We performed an
intention-to-treat analysis, comparing SIRS incidence, post-
operative 24-hour bleeding, and the need for haemoderivatives.
We used SPSS-12.2 software for statistical purposes.
Results No significant differences were found between groups for
demographic, biochemical, and surgical characteristics. The
incidence of post-CPB SIRS was significantly lower in the TA
group than in the placebo group (17% vs 42%; P = 0.048). Fifty-
three per cent of SIRS patients had vasoplegic shock vs 0% in
non-SIRS patients (P < 0.001), and SIRS patients required more
red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (P = 0.013), and more fresh
plasma (P = 0.014) in the first 4 postoperative hours. The SIRS
group showed an hyperfibrinolytic state, TA reduced fibrinolysis
parameters such as D-dimer (P < 0.001). The TA group lost less
blood than the placebo group (492 ± 387 ml vs 1036 ± 147 ml;
P = 0.001) and required less RBC (475 ± 146 ml vs 962 ± 165 ml;
P = 0.021) and less fresh plasma (33 ± 33 ml vs 409 ± 144 ml;
P = 0.012). In the TA group the incidence of vasoplegic shock was
significantly lower (P = 0.013), as was the use of norepinephrine
(P = 0.029) and the mechanical ventilation time (P = 0.018).
Conclusions We observed a significant reduction of SIRS and
postoperative bleeding in the group of CPB patients who received
tranexamic acid.

Introduction Human recombinant erythropoietin (rh-Epo) may be a
potent neuroprotectant [1]. It is approved in Canada to reduce
blood transfusions in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery,
which is complicated by neurocognitive dysfunction (NCD) in
50–80% of patients at discharge, 10–36% at 6 weeks and 42%
at 5 years [2]. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled study in 32 first-time CABG patients to investigate the
feasibility and safety of three doses of rh-Epo with the ultimate goal
of reducing NCD in patients following CABG.
Methods Patients were randomized to receive placebo or a total of
375 U/kg, 750 U/kg, or 1500 U/kg rh-Epo divided into three
doses: the day before, the time of, and the day after surgery. A
battery of 10 neuropsychological tests was performed pre-
operatively, at discharge and at 2 months. The primary outcomes
were feasibility and safety, including recruitment rates, 28-day all-
cause mortality, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), incidence
of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and thrombotic complications
(stroke, myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary
embolism). The secondary outcome was the incidence of NCD
defined as a 20% reduction in 20% of the tests.
Results Consent was obtained in 32/101 of eligible patients. All
subjects were male with mean age 60 years (range 46–73 years).
Hypertension was present in 66%, diabetes in 22%, dyslipidemia
in 81%, CHF in 6% and COPD in 6%. The mean pump time was
76 min (SD 23), and the mean cross-clamp time was 56 min (SD
22). The median ICU LOS was 1 day (IQR range 1–2). The median
hospital LOS was 6 days (IQR 5–6.5). Mortality, PRCA and
thrombotic complications were not observed. NCD was present in
66% of patients at discharge and 16% at 2 months. One patient
declined 2-month follow-up. NCD at discharge, by group, was:
placebo 75%, 375 U/kg 50%, 750 U/kg 75% and 1500 U/kg
63%. NCD at 2 months, by group, was: placebo 38%, 375 U/kg
13%, 750 U/kg 13% and 1500 U/kg 0%. Patients receiving
rh-Epo at any dose had an incidence of NCD of 8.3%, compared
with 38% for placebo (P = 0.085). The comorbidity, mean pump
time and mean cross-clamp time were not significantly different
between the two groups, nor were the ICU and hospital LOS.
Conclusion This study of rh-Epo as a neuroprotectant in patients
undergoing CABG surgery is feasible and safe. rh-Epo was
associated with a trend in the reduction of NCD at 2 months.
These data support a multicentre study of rh-Epo to reduce NCD
in CABG patients.

Introduction Large differences in tolerance of organ systems for
conditions of decreased O2 delivery such as hemodilution exist.
The kidney is an organ receiving a high amount of oxygen and is
generally regarded as being less prone to reduced oxygen delivery.
In a model of acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) we studied
the total oxygenation of the rat kidney.
Methods In 12 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated (FiO2
0.4) male Wistar rats, the arterial blood pressure (MAP) and renal
blood flow (RBF) were recorded. After infusion of Oxyphor G2 the
renal cortical (c) and medullary (m) microvascular PO2 (µPO2) and
the renal venous PO2 were continuously measured by oxygen-
dependent quenching of phosphorescence. Six animals underwent
four steps of ANH (hematocrit 25%, 15%, 10% and <10%). Six
animals served as time controls. Data are presented as means ±
SD. P < 0.01 was considered significant.
Results Baseline values: RBF 6.0 ± 0.5 ml/min, cµPO2 71 ± 12
mmHg, mµPO2 53 ± 3 mmHg, DO2ren 1.4 ± 0.2 ml/min and VO2ren
0.13 ± 0.04 ml/min/g. Despite a significant increase in RBF in the first
two steps of ANH (7.9 ± 2.5 and 7.5 ± 1.1 ml/min, respectively),
cµPO2 and mµPO2 dropped immediately (hematocrit 25%: 37 ± 6
and 29 ± 2 mmHg; hematocrit 15%: 20 ± 4 and 15 ± 2 mmHg,
respectively). VO2ren became dependent on supply when DO2ren fell
below 0.5 ml/min (hematocrit 15%). With impairment of µPO2 during
progressive hemodilution (lowest values cµPO2 and mµPO2 12 ± 4
and 10 ± 3 mmHg, respectively), a significant correlation between
cµPO2 and mµPO2 and VO2ren could be observed (hematocrit
≤15%). Furthermore there was a high correlation between VO2ren
and RBF over a wide range of different flows.
Conclusion Our data provide evidence that the oxygen supply to
the renal tissue is already becoming critical in an early stage of
acute normovolemic hemodilution.

Low hematocrit causes worsened cerebral injury after
prolonged hypothermic circulatory arrest in rats: possible
involvement of C-Fos, Bcl-2 and Bax

Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P229 (doi: 10.1186/cc4576)
Background Although experience with cardiovascular surgery in
adults refusing transfusion suggests that very low hematocrit levels
can be tolerated, the optimal hematocrit level for cerebral
protection during CPB and HCA has not been defined. Gaining
insights into the cerebral consequences of HCA and CPB, and in
particular the molecular pathways possibly involved, has been
limited by the relative inability to study brain tissue after recovery
from HCA and CPB. With the development of a rat model of CPB,
we have been able to sample brain tissue after HCA and CPB for
molecular analysis with well-established molecular tools. In this
study, we hypothesized that low hematocrit causes worsened
cerebral injury after prolonged hypothermic circulatory arrest in
rats, with possible involvement of C-Fos, Bcl-2 and Bax.
Methods A rat HCA model was developed and animals were
randomly distributed into four groups: sham operation group (sham
op); hematocrit (Hct) 10% group; Hct 20% group and Hct 30%
group (n = 10 each). All animals except those of the sham op
group underwent HCA for 90 min at 18°C. Physiologic values such
as Hct, pH and so on were monitored. Brain damage after HCA
was evaluated with the light microscopy and electron microscopy.
RT-PCR and imunohistochemistry techniques were used to
measure the transcription and translation of the C-Fos, Bcl-2 and
Bax in various brain parts.
Results After beginning CPB, Hct was decreased to the target levels.
The number of injured neurons in the hippocampus CA1 and parietal
cortex in the Hct 10% group (CA1: 11.44 ± 2.52; cortex: 13.65 ±
2.31) was higher than that of the Hct 20% group (CA1: 8.29 ± 1.31;
cortex: 10.68 ± 1.24; P < 0.05), and the Hct 20% group was higher
than that of the Hct 30% group (CA1: 4.40 ± 1.98; cortex: 7.38 ±
2.11). The mean score of mitochondrial injury in the Hct 10% group
(34.05 ± 1.56) was higher than that of the Hct 20% group (29.30 ±
0.68; P < 0.05) and the Hct 20% group was higher than that of the
Hct 30% group (18.65 ± 0.53; P < 0.05). The ratio of mRNA
transcription of C-Fos and Bax to that of β-actin in the Hct 10% group
(C-Fos: 1.94 ± 0.19; Bax: 1.41 ± 0.12) was higher than that of the
Hct 20% group (C-Fos: 1.66 ± 0.13; Bax: 1.22 ± 0.14, P < 0.05)
and the Hct 20% group was higher than that of the Hct 30% group
(C-Fos: 1.33 ± 0.16; Bax: 0.99 ± 0.14, P < 0.05). On the other hand,
the transcription of the Bcl-2 mRNA in the Hct 30% group (0.97 ±
0.04) was higher than that of the Hct 20% group (0.76 ± 0.10) and
the Hct 10% group (0.75 ± 0.12, P < 0.05). The numbers of C-Fos
and Bax immunoreactive cells in the hippocampus CA1 and parietal
cortex in the Hct 10% group (C-Fos in CA1: 14.00 ± 2.45; C-Fos in
cortex: 18.67 ± 2.16; Bax in CA1: 22.50 ± 1.87; Bax in cortex: 24.33
± 3.88) were higher than those of the Hct 20% group (C-Fos in CA1:
10.83 ± 1.94; C-Fos in cortex: 12.50 ± 1.87; Bax in CA1: 14.67 ±
2.94; Bax in cortex: 14.00 ± 2.83; P < 0.05), and the Hct 20% group
was higher than that of the Hct 30% group (C-Fos in CA1: 5.83 ±
0.75; C-Fos in cortex: 7.50 ± 1.05; Bax in CA1: 10.83 ± 1.47; Bax in
cortex: 9.17 ± 1.72; P < 0.05). The number of Bcl-2 immunoreactive
cells in the HCT 30% group (CA1: 13.33 ± 2.16; cortex: 15.50 ±
1.87) was higher than that of the Hct 20% group (CA1: 11.00 ±
1.41; cortex: 11.83 ± 2.04) and the Hct 10% group (CA1: 9.33 ±
1.21; cortex: 9.67 ± 1.03, P < 0.05).
Conclusions Low hematocrit resulted in evidence of worsened
cerebral injury after prolonged HCA and CPB in rats, which is
possibly due to the regulation of the C-Fos, Bcl-2 and Bax
transcription and translations.

Background Among the common problems in critically ill ICU
patients is anemia, the consequences of which on mortality and
morbidity are not adequately studied.
Objectives To describe the anemia incidence and the red blood
cell transfusion strategy in critically ill patients and their relationship
to clinical outcome.
Patients and methods The study period lasted from July 2003 to
December 2004. The patients were enrolled within 48 hours of
ICU admission. The follow-up time was 30 days, until hospital
discharge or death.
Results A total of 169 patients (116 male, 53 female, mean age
57.6 ± 2.1 years, range 15–96 years) were included in the study.
The mean hemoglobin level at baseline was 11.2 ± 2.1. Overall,
63.9% (108/169) of the patients received one or more RBC units
while in the ICU (mean 3.1 ± 3.8 units per patient). The mean
pretransfusion Hb was 8.7 ± 1.8 g/dl and the mean time to first
ICU transfusion was 2.6 ± 4.1 days. More RBC transfusions were
given in the first week of the ICU stay (331units vs 110, 61 and 36
units in the second, third and fourth week, respectively). The
number of RBC units transfused during the study were positively
associated with a longer ICU length of stay and increased mortality
(r = 0.19, P < 0.05 and r = 0.26, P < 0.05, respectively). The
baseline Hb level was significantly related to the number of RBC
transfusions (r = 0.55, P < 0.001), but was not an independent
predictive risk factor of length of stay or mortality (r = 0.16,
P > 0.05 and r = 0.13, P > 0.05, respectively). The mean baseline
APACHE II and SAPS scores were 19.6 ± 7.4 and 49.8 ± 17.4,
respectively. Furthermore, both baseline APACHE II and SAPS
scores were significantly higher in patients with a baseline Hb level
<10 g/dl (23.2 ± 7.9 vs 18.3 ± 6.7 and 54.6 ± 18.8 vs
48.1 ± 16.5, respectively), while the APACHE II values were
positively associated with a significantly increased likelihood of
RBC transfusion (Pearson correlation P < 0.005).
Conclusions In ICU patients the commonly occurring anemia
appears early in their ICU course and conveys them throughout
their ICU stay. More RBC transfusions are given during the first
week of the ICU stay. The severity of illness seems to have a
positive relation to transfusion requirements. Although a strong
enough statistical correlation emerges from our study, further
prospective studies with larger cohorts are required in order to
definitively address the issue.

with worsened neurological outcome. Traditionally, red blood cell
(RBC) transfusion has been employed in patients with sTBI to
improve oxygen delivery to the brain. The objective of this study
was to determine the effect of RBC transfusion on cerebral
oxygenation and metabolism in patients with sTBI.
Methods Adult patients with sTBI were randomized to one of three
transfusion thresholds: 8, 9, or 10 g/dl. Patients with active
hemorrhage or coronary ischemia were excluded. A tissue oxygen
monitor and cerebral microdialysis catheter were placed in the
nondominant frontal region. When the patient’s hemoglobin
concentration fell below their assigned threshold, 2 units packed
RBCs were transfused, each over 1 hour. Following transfusion, a
1-hour period of stabilization was observed prior to final data
collection. The primary outcome was change in brain tissue oxygen
(PbO2). Secondary outcomes included dependence of baseline
hemoglobin concentration and baseline PbO2 on the relationship
of transfusion and PbO2, and the effect of transfusion on lactate/
pyruvate ratio and brain pH as markers of cerebral metabolic state.
Analysis was performed using a population-averaged panel-data
model developed using a generalized estimating equation (GEE)
variant of the generalized linear method.
Results Thirty patients (21 male) with a mean (SD) age of 39 (15)
years were studied. The median (IQR) pre-intubation GCS was 7
(6, 10). Transfusion occurred on median (IQR) day 4 (3, 6) after
injury. Patients received a mean (SD) of 551 (58) ml packed
RBCs. Transfusion resulted in a significant increase in hemoglobin
concentration (pre-transfusion mean [SD] 8.4 [0.8], post-
transfusion 10.2 [0.9]; P < 0.0001). Multivariable GEE analysis
revealed the following variables to be positively associated with an
increase in PbO2: [Hb] 0.10 kPa/(g/dl) (95% CI: 0.03–0.17, P =
0.003); PaO2 0.09 kPa/kPa (95% CI: 0.04–0.13. P < 0.001); and
CPP 0.02 kPa/mmHg (95% CI: 0.008–0.031, P = 0.001). Probe
location, age, GCS, time of transfusion from injury, pHb, PbCO2,
and temperature were not significantly related to the change in
PbO2. Improvement in PbO2 was not associated with the baseline
Hb, assigned transfusion threshold group or low baseline PbO2
(<1 kPa). The lactate/pyruvate ratio and pHb did not change during
the course of the study.
Conclusion RBC transfusion improved PbO2 without an effect on
the cerebral metabolism.

Red cell pack use and mortality rate in Brazilian septic
patients: Sepsis Brazil study
R Hatum, J Andrade, C Davi
Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P232 (doi: 10.1186/cc4579)
Background Anemia in the setting of critical illness is quite prevalent,
with 37–44% of patients receiving at least one blood transfusion
during their ICU stay [1,2]. In one representative study [3], 85% of
patients with an ICU length of stay greater than 1 week received at
least one blood transfusion. In more than two-thirds of these cases
blood transfusion was not associated with acute blood loss.
Objective To compare packed red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in
septic patients and the mortality rate in septic patients.
Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study in 65 hospitals
of all regions of Brazil. The patients who were admitted or who
developed sepsis during September 2003 were enrolled. They were
followed until the 28th day. Sepsis diagnosis was made in
accordance with the criteria proposed by ACCP/SCCM in 1992. We
evaluated demographic features, APACHE II score, SOFA score,
mortality, sources of infections, microbiology and interventions. We
also recorded underlying diseases and length of stay.
Results A total of 3128 patients were identified and 526 (16.8%)
filled the criteria of sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock. Two
hundred and thirty-three patients (44.7%) received a RBC
transfusion and 288 did not (55.3%). Five patients were excluded
(three lost to follow-up and two lack RBC transfusion registry).
One hundred and eighteen patients (50.6%) of the transfused
group were dead on the 28th day; 115 (49.4%) were alive. One
hundred and twenty-five patients (43.4%) of the nontransfused
group were dead on the 28th day; 163 (56.6%) were alive. The
APACHE II score in both groups was 20, with an expected
mortality rate of 40%.
Conclusions RBC transfusion made no difference in the 28-day
mortality rate (the number of patients dead or alive with RBC
transfusion was almost the same). In the nontransfused group the
number of patients alive on the 28th follow-up day is greater then
the number of dead patients.

Introduction To reverse oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, a
number of treatment modalities is available. Fresh frozen plasma
(FFP) is effective and is currently used for coagulation factor
replacement, carrying a risk of volume overload, transmission of
infective agents and being time consuming. Variable and frequently
low potency of clotting factors results in minor haemostatic effects
compared with prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC), which
are considered very effective and safe. PCC PPSB-SD® has
constant, highly concentrated levels of factors II, VII, IX and X
compared with FFP. We studied the efficacy of the intraoperative
administration of PCC and FFP in patients on OAC therapy
undergoing heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
Method After Ethical Committee approval and informed consent,
40 patients (P group, n = 20; FFP group, n = 20) with a
preoperative INR ≥2.1 were studied. PCC was supplied as 500 IU
factor IX (20 ml) vials. The dose was calculated on the basis of
body weight, the initial INR and the target INR aiming at an INR of
1.5 after protamine. One-half of this dose was administered before
the start of CPB. After weaning from CPB and protamine, the
second half-dose was given in order to reach a postoperative INR
≤1.5. In case the INR value was still too high a further dose of
PPSB was given. In the FFP group, each patient received 4 units:
one-half of this dose was given before CPB and the other half after
CPB. Additional FFP was given until the INR had reached a

danger of volume overload, PCC was given. A portable coagulation
monitor (CoaguChek) was used for INR measurements. Blood

preadministration and postadministration before CPB (T1,T2),
during CPB at 15 and 45 min (T3, T4), at the end of CPB (T5),
after protamine administration (T6), and 15 and 60 min and 3 and
16 hours post-CB (T7–T10).
Analyses performed were: INR, PT, Hct, ACT, aPTT, ad factors II,
VII, IX, X and FV. The amount of blood lost in the chest tube
drainage and the blood products administered was also registered.
Statistical evaluations were performed using the Student t test,
repeated-measurements ANOVA and Fisher’s exact test.
Results The P group was more successful in reaching the target
INR. In the FFP group 16/20 (80%) patients received an additional
dose of PPSB vs 6/20 (30%) in the PCC group. The INR with
PCC treatment dropped sooner below 1.5 than that in the FFP
group. More patients in this group reached the target INR in the
first hour after ending CPB (T7, P < 0.007). We found a significant
difference between groups in factor II (P = 0.023) and factor X
(P = 0.008) levels over time.
Conclusion The results of our study support the use of PCC in
patients on OAC therapy facing semi-urgent or urgent cardiac
surgery. Treatment with PCC reverses anticoagulation safely, more
rapidly and more effectively than FFP.

Clinical application of an integrated multiparameter system
in perioperative body stress assessment
X Wang
Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P234 (doi: 10.1186/cc4581)
Objective As an important reaction against nociceptive stimulus,
perioperative stress response has important predictable effects
during operation. A moderate stress reaction can protect patients
from excessive injury and enable them to safely live through the
operation. However, to evaluate perioperative stress levels properly
and maintain the reaction in a suitable range to decrease post-
operative complications remains a problem. In the present study,
we applied a novel system that integrated life multiparameters into
a composite index to evaluate patients’ reactions to body stress,
and the stability and accuracy of the system was further estimated
by modifying the intensity of body stress with electroacupuncture.
Method Volunteers were randomly selected. Multiparameters were
recorded respectively. The physiological parameters, including
heart rate (HR), variety of HR, pulse tracings (PT), variety of PT,
blood pressure (BP), variety of BP, high frequency of electro-
encephalogram (HFECG), electric resistance of skin, bispectral
index (BIS) and perfusion index (PI), were recorded continually. In
addition, blood samples were collected at different time points
(including preoperation, onset time of operation, and every 15 min
postoperation) to acquire biochemical indicators, such as
adnephrin, noradrenalin, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and so on.
The aforementioned parameters were analyzed with the algorithms
of ambiguity mathematics according to the principle of evidence-
based methods of cybernetics, combined with modern intelligence
technology, integrating into a physiological and a biochemical
stress index, respectively, which tended to reflect the intensity of
the body reaction to nociceptive stimulus. Electroacupuncture was
then applied to modify the intensity of body stress. Stress indexes
were acquired accordingly.
Results (1) Every parameter in this system contributed to certain
weight in the stress index. Changes of stress indexes paralleled
with a variety of perioperative stress intensities. A preliminary
estimation of the stimulus level can thus be achieved from the
stress indexes. (2) The multiparameter system was designed
based on modern mathematical methods including fuzzy theory,
grey system and neural networks, and bioinformation reflecting the
intensity of stress reaction in these parameters was excavated with
the algorithms of ambiguity mathematics. (3) Correlation between
the physiological index and biochemical stress index was validated
in the multiparameter system, with the conclusion that there was
positive concordance between them. So the system using inte-
grated physiological multi-indexes can replace the blood sample
analysis to estimate body stress more promptly and, feasibly, with
less injury. The multiparameter system provided a platform for
evaluating stress reaction standardly and optimally. (4) In this
study, the effects of electroacupuncture significantly modulated the
body reaction to stress, and the effect can be estimated with a
multiparameter system timely and accurately.
Conclusion In this study, a life multiparameter system was explored
with a combination of medicine, mathematics and bioengineering.
The body reaction to stress was estimated by integrated multi-
indexes, including physiological parameters and blood bio-
chemistry parameters. The biochemical analysis can be replaced
by an integrated physiological multiparameter system, as the latter
can assess stress continuously and promptly. The system provided
a platform and an objective reference standard to evaluate the
stress reaction. In addition, the effects of electroacupuncture
modulating stress were validated and estimated by the multi-
parameter system.

Phosphodiesterase 4D disruption causes ββ2 adrenergic
receptors to behave like ββ1 adrenergic receptors in vivo
N Pearl, C Chang, M Bruss, J Wong, R Agrawal, B Kobilka,

Background β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors (βARs) are G-protein-
coupled receptors that mediate physiologic responses to
catecholamines in the heart. β1ARs couple to stimulatory G protein
(Gs) and elicit increases in inotropic and chronotropic performance
during acute activation. Continuous activation of β1ARs is
cardiotoxic, causing ventricular remodeling. β2ARs couple first to
Gs then to inhibitory G protein (Gi). Continuous β2AR activation
may protect the heart from continuous β1AR stimulation.
Distribution of cAMP within myocytes differs after β1AR stimulation
relative to β2AR stimulation. β1AR activation results in a global
increase in cAMP while β2AR activation generates an increase only
within restricted cellular subdomains. Phosphodiesterase 4D
(PDE4D) degrades cAMP and is recruited to activated β2ARs after
agonist-induced internalization of the receptors. In cultured myocytes,
inhibition of PDE4D leads to a global rise in cAMP levels after β2AR
stimulation and causes β2AR signaling to resemble that of the β1AR.
Hypothesis We hypothesized that mice with disruption of both
β1AR and PDE4D (β1/PDE4D DKO) would experience myocardial
remodeling similar to that associated with continuous β1AR
stimulation.
Methods Seven β1/PDE4D DKO, 11 β2KO, and seven wild-type
mice were evaluated. The wild-type and β2KO mice received 14-day
infusions of the βAR agonist isoproterenol. ECG-gated magnetic
resonance imaging was used to determine the left ventricle end
diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricle end systolic volume, and
heart rate. The stroke volume and cardiac output were calculated.
Results See Fig. 1.
Conclusions Disruption of PDE4D causes β2ARs to behave like
β1ARs in vivo, just as it does in vitro.

Background Patients with chronic alcohol misuse have an
increased risk of postoperative bleeding complications compared
with non-alcoholic individuals [1]. Serotonin increases [2], and
cAMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) decrease,
platelet aggregation [3]. The aim of our study was to examine
platelet-rich plasma levels of the mentioned substances in long-
term alcoholic patients undergoing surgery.
Methods We included 33 consecutive patients with chronic
alcohol misuse scheduled for tumor resections of the upper
digestive tract and postoperative intensive care. We defined long-
term alcoholic patients as having a daily alcohol intake of at least
60 g and fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria of the American Psychiatric
Association for alcohol abuse or dependence. Blood samples were
collected before and 1 day after surgery. Serotonin was measured
by ELISA, cAMP and cGMP by radioimmunoassay. Additionally,
we measured standard coagulation tests and determined platelet
aggregation induced by ADP, collagen, epinephrine and ristocetin
before and after surgery. Statistics: Mann–Whitney U test.
Results Basic patient characteristics and platelet aggregation
responses induced by the mentioned agonists did not significantly
differ. Data are presented in Table 1.
Table 1 (abstract P236)
Parameter Alcoholics Nonalcoholics P value

cAMP postoperatively (nmol/l) 1.8 (1.5–2.3) 2.7 (2.1–3.9) 0.03
cGMP preoperatively (nmol/l) 4.0 (2.3–5.8) 5.6 (1.6–14.4) 0.77
cGMP postoperatively (nmol/l) 2.9 (2.3–7.8) 3.7 (1.4–9.3) 0.94
Serotonin preoperatively 381 (194–573) 386 (180–905) 0.98
(ng/109 platelets)
Serotonin postoperatively 288 (193–380) 460 (225–923) 0.10
(ng/109 platelets)
Data presented as median (25th–75th quartiles).
Conclusion In contrast to previous studies, there were no
significantly altered aggregation responses in long-term alcoholic
patients. A possible explanation might be the decreased inhibition
through diminished cAMP levels. Our findings may suggest that
cGMP and serotonin do not influence the perioperative hemostasis.

Starling axis. Measurements of LVEDV and stroke volume were
obtained using electrocardiogram-gated MRI and plotted on a Starling
axis. By 8 months of age the β1/PDE4D DKO mice demonstrated left
ventricular dilatation similar to that experienced by β2KO mice during
continuous catecholamine (isoprotenerol) administration. In β2KO
mice, the dilatation has been attributed to cardiac remodeling caused
by continuous β1 adrenergic receptor activation in the absence of β2
adrenergic receptor-mediated protective effects. The absence of the
β1 adrenergic receptor in the β1/PDE4D DKO mice suggests that the
PDE4D disruption causes β2 adrenergic receptors to behave like β1
adrenergic receptors in vivo, a phenomenon that has been shown to
occur in vitro.

resuscitation in early sepsis [1]. There has been no published
study examining the effect of inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2)
on SCVO2. We performed a study to examine the effect of
increasing FiO2 on SCVO2.
Methods We studied 20 stable critical care patients who had
arterial and central venous lines in situ and who were not due to
undergo any events that would affect their oxygen consumption or
delivery. After consent was obtained, basal arterial and central
venous gases were obtained. Their FiO2 was then increased to
1.0. After 30 min further arterial and central venous gases were
taken and the patient’s FiO2 was returned to baseline.
Results The mean baseline FiO2 was 0.35. The mean SaO2
increased from 97.5% (SD 1.6) to 99.5% (SD 0.6), mean increase
2% (95% CI 1.3–2.6, P < 0.001 [paired t test]). The mean SCVO2
increased significantly from 73.3% (SD 6.6) to 80.0% (SD 7.0), mean
increase was 6.7% (95% CI 4.8–8.7, P < 0.001 [paired t test]).
Discussion This study has two implications. First, SCVO2 should
be interpreted with knowledge of FiO2. Patients receiving high
inspired oxygen concentrations may have elevated SCVO2 values
leading to false reassurance. Second, in early resuscitation many of
our strategies are aimed at increasing tissue oxygen delivery. We
measure SCVO2 as a marker of oxygen extraction and thereby
oxygen delivery. Our study showed that SCVO2 can be
significantly increased by increasing FiO2, which implies better
tissue oxygen delivery. Other investigators have shown that
increasing FiO2 can increase tissue oxygen delivery in surgical
patients [2] and in patients with traumatic brain injury [3]. It is
possible that increasing FiO2 during the resuscitation of patients
with sepsis may improve tissue oxygen delivery while other
resuscitation is ongoing.
Conclusion Increasing FiO2 significantly increased SCVO2 in our
study.

Contribution of perfusion-related, metabolic and
respiratory components to gastric mucosal acidosis in
acute cardiorespiratory failure
S Jakob1, I Parviainen2, E Ruokonen2, J Takala1
1University Hospital — Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland; 2University
Hospital Kuopio, Finland
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P238 (doi: 10.1186/cc4585)
Introduction Local mucosal acidosis in acute circulatory and
respiratory failure is influenced by three main components: local
perfusion and metabolism (mucosal–arterial pCO2 gradient),
systemic metabolic acidosis (arterial bicarbonate), and respiration
(arterial pCO2). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of
primary resuscitation on these components of gastric mucosal pH
in surviving and nonsurviving patients admitted to the ICU.
Patients and methods One hundred and three patients with acute
respiratory or circulatory failure (age 63 ± 15 years [mean ± SD],
APACHE II score 20 ± 6, SOFA score 8 ± 3) were studied during
the first 24 hours after ICU admission. Gastric air tonometers were
inserted and arterial blood gases for the calculation of pHi and
DpCO2 were taken ≥4 times daily. The effects of bicarbonate, and
arterial and mucosal pCO2 on pHi were calculated using the
Hendersson–Hasselbach equation.
Results The pHi increased from 7.27 ± 0.14 at admission to
7.30 ± 0.12 after 24 hours (P < 0.005). Twenty-three patients died
in hospital. In nonsurvivors, ∆pCO2 contributed more to pHi at
admission than in survivors (0.04 ± 0.10 vs –0.02 ± 0.09, P = 0.023)
and this effect persisted for 24 hours. Arterial bicarbonate altered
pHi at admission twice as much as ∆pCO2 (nonsurvivors:
0.08 ± 0.10 vs survivors: 0.03 ± 0.09, P = 0.006) but this effect
decreased during the first 24 hours (in nonsurvivors to 0.04 ± 0.10
and in survivors to 0.01 ± 0.09, P < 0.001 both). In nonsurvivors,
hypocapnia increased pHi both at admission and after 24 hours
(P = 0.013 both).
Conclusions Persistent inadequate gastric mucosal perfusion
(increased ∆pCO2) during primary resuscitation is associated with
increased mortality. Arterial bicarbonate contributes more to
gastric mucosal acidosis than the ∆pCO2 at admission, and
increases in both survivors and nonsurvivors. The severity of
mucosal acidosis is partially masked by hyperventilation. These
results support the concept that inadequate microcirculatory
perfusion may persist despite normalization of systemic
hemodynamics and that this contributes to poor outcome.

Comparison of arterial haemoglobin and electrolyte
measurements between an arterial blood gas analyser and
the laboratory on the critical care unit
A Beggs, M Grounds, D Bennett, T Rahman
St Georges Hospital, London, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P239 (doi: 10.1186/cc4586)
Introduction Arterial blood gas analysers are commonly used in
ICUs to provide a measurement of haemoglobin and electrolytes to
determine progress and titrate therapy. Comparison between
these analysers and formal laboratory measurement has not
previously been undertaken in a large number of samples in the
setting of a critical care unit. Anecdotal evidence suggests
possible poor correlation.
Hypothesis To compare and contrast two methods of haemoglobin
and electrolyte evaluation, expecting a significant difference.
Design A prospective, paired observational study.
Methods Patients had paired samples taken from their arterial line
for arterial blood gas analysis via a Radiometer PICO 70 arterial
sampler, and also samples taken into Vacutainer collection bottles
for formal laboratory analysis. A Radiometer Copenhagen ABL700
or ABL625 blood gas analyser measured the total haemoglobin,
sodium, potassium and chloride. Formal laboratory samples were
analysed on GenS (haemoglobin) and LX20 (sodium, potassium
and chloride) analysers (Beckman-Coulter). Samples were
compared via a paired t test.
Results Two hundred and thirty-eight paired samples were
collected over a 2-month period. The correlation coefficients
between arterial blood gas analysis and formal laboratory analysis
for haemoglobin, sodium, potassium and chloride were 0.934,
0.945, 0.817 and 0.922, respectively. There was no significant
difference between the two methods of measurement in this study
when measuring these variables (P < 0.001)
Conclusion Arterial blood gas analysis is an accurate method of
measuring haemoglobin, sodium, potassium and chloride in the
critical care unit. The transfusion practice and electrolyte or fluid
resuscitation can therefore be accurately guided by the arterial
blood gas measurements. This will be dependent on the accurate
and regular calibration of the measuring device.

Potential pharmacobiological and hormonal effects on
resuscitation

Hospital, Dallas, TX, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P240 (doi: 10.1186/cc4587)
Objectives Studies have now clearly shown sex-related
differences in the clinical presentations of women (vs men) with
out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA) and, more importantly,
differences in the ability to resuscitate them. Presumably, these
observations indicate potential pharmacobiological and/or hormonal
factors. However, almost all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests
(OOHCAs) occur in postmenopausal women aged >60 years. The
purpose of this investigation was therefore to delineate any further
stratification in sex-related differences when examining the
outcomes of younger women and men (<50 years old) prospec-
tively entered into a very large OOHCA registry.
Methods A prospective, population-based, 7-year study of all adult
(>18 years) OOHCAs in an urban-EMS system with centralized
protocols and medical direction using Utstein-style data guidelines.
In terms of ability to resuscitate, the endpoints evaluated were
return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and short-term survival
(SURV) for those <50 years of age vs those >50 years.
Results Of the nearly 10,000 consecutive OOHCAs studied,
3926 were women (with 839 <50 years) and 5519 were men
(with 1653 <50 years). Although OOHCAs for women were
witnessed less often, were fewer in ventricular fibrillation (VF)
presentations (21% vs 29% for men) and were less frequent with
bystander CPR, they still achieved ROSC (46% vs 39%; P < 0.001)
and SURV (21% vs 17%; P < 0.001) more often than men,
especially if they were <50 years of age (ROSC = 52% for women
vs 41% for men, P < 0.001; SURV = 28% vs 17%; P < 0.001).
Also, for younger women, VF SURV was 31% vs 16% for men
(P < 0.001) while VF SURV for older patients was 29% vs 20%.
For pulseless electrical activity (PEA) cases, SURV was 29% vs
18% (P < 0.001) for younger ages, but was not different for the
older women and men (18% vs 19%). For asystole presentations,
it was 21% vs 11% (younger group; P < 0.001) and was 10% for
both women and men >50 years of age.
Conclusions Relative to men, younger women (<50 years of age)
are strikingly easier to resuscitate from cardiac arrest than older
counterparts, especially with PEA and asystole presentations.
Regardless of eventual neurological outcomes, these findings
significantly strengthen the argument that there may be either
hormonal and/or pharmacobiological differences between men and
women that facilitate the ability to resuscitate. While these findings
still ostensibly suggest genetic links to ROSC (and possible sex-
related differences in the effects and dosing of interventions), the
data here now strongly infer hormonal (e.g. estrogenic) differences
as a key factor in these observations.

Protection of mitochondria by intensive insulin therapy in
critical illness: blood glucose control or insulin?

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P241 (doi: 10.1186/cc4588)
Strict blood glucose control with intensive insulin therapy reduces
the mortality and morbidity of critically ill patients [1]. To elucidate
the relative impact of maintaining normoglycemia and glycemia-
independent actions of insulin, we independently manipulated
blood glucose (normal NG, high HG) and insulin levels (normal NI,
high HI) in a rabbit model of prolonged critical illness [2]. We here
focus on the mitochondrial compartment, which in the liver was
shown to be protected by intensive insulin therapy [3].
In the liver, activities of all respiratory chain complexes are
statistically similar for control and NI/NG rabbits. HI/NG rabbits
have lower complex I activity than control or NI/NG animals and
lower complex V activity than controls. Complexes I, II and V are
further reduced in the NI/HG group and are even more severely
affected in the HI/HG rabbits, with residual activities of 46%, 44%
and 25% of control values, respectively. Complex III is only
affected in HI/HG rabbits (62% of controls), whereas complex IV
levels are similar in all groups. Complexes I, II, III and V are lower in
HG vs NG groups. HI may negatively affect mitochondrial function
and as such does not contribute to the protective effect of
intensive insulin therapy on this cellular compartment. Compromised
hepatic mitochondrial enzyme activities correlate with the degree
of liver damage evaluated by serum ALT levels. Mitochondrial
enzyme activities in the left ventricle are statistically equal for
control, NI/NG and HI/NG rabbits. Complex III and V activities are
lower in NI/HG than in NI/NG rabbits. Mitochondria of HI/HG
rabbits are the most affected also in the heart, with residual activities
of 76%, 84%, 61% and 47% compared with the NI/HG group for
complexes I, II, III and V, respectively. Electron microscopic analysis
confirmed the presence of severely damaged mitochondria in
cardiac myocytes of HI/HG rabbits and is ongoing for liver.
In conclusion, the beneficial effect of intensive insulin therapy on
hepatocytic mitochondria [3] is explained by avoiding glucose
toxicity. The deleterious effect on both liver and cardiac
mitochondria in the HI/HG group may be particularly important in
view of the controversy surrounding glucose–insulin–potassium
infusion and highlights the need for simultaneous glucose control
when applying this therapy.

Background Tight glucose control was shown to greatly improve the
morbidity and mortality of septic ICU patients [1]. The mechanism by
which hyperglycemia is detrimental is not clearly understood.
Hypothesis Hyperglycemia is associated with hepatic dysfunction
of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC).
Methods Male Sprague–Dawley rats, 250–400 g, were used. We
followed glucose levels in rats made septic by cecal ligation and
perforation (CLP) over time (tail puncturing). We also evaluated
MRC in isolated liver mitochondria at different time-points post-
CLP. Enzymatic activities of MRC complexes I–IV were measured
by spectrophotometry and respiration was measured by an oxygen
electrode with glutamate + malate as substrates. The respiratory
control ratio (RCR), calculated as the ratio of oxygen uptake in the
presence and absence of ADP, served as an indicator for coupling.
Sham laparotomy rats served as controls.

Results Hyperglycemia was evident 6 hours post-CLP, followed by
a significant decrease of the blood glucose level (Fig. 1). Mitochon-
drial dysfunction was manifested as an up to 48% reduction of the
RCR (Fig. 2). A mild reduction of oxygen consumption and MRC
complexes I, II and IV (70%, 77%, 57% and 73% residual activity
respectively, compared with controls) was observed at 6 hours
post-CLP.
Conclusions This rat CLP model of sepsis, in its early hours,
mimics human septic hyperglycemia. Impaired function of a septic
rat’s liver mitochondria (markedly decreased coupling and
moderately decreased MRC activities) is evident following the
time-period of hyperglycemia in this model.

Objective To verify the significance of strict blood glucose (BG)
control and to clarify the beneficial BG level in acutely ill severe
patients with glucose intolerance.
Materials and methods Ninety patients were retrospectively
investigated in whom BG control was performed by means of the
bed-side type artificial pancreas (AP), STG22 (NIKKISO Corp.,
Japan). The patients were evaluated at two phases, that is, early
phase or just after admission (E phase) and late phase (L phase:
about 1 week after the E phase). Based on the daily mean BG level
(BGm), patients were classified into two groups (i.e. high group
and low group), which were compared with the three selected
BGm values, or 150, 175, and 200 mg/dl. The patients with BGm
below 150 mg/dl was group 150b and those above 150 mg/dl
was group 150a, as well as those below 175 mg/dl being group
175b and those above 175 mg/dl being group 175a, and those
below 200 mg/dl being group 200b and those above 200 mg/dl
being group 200a. Parameters studied were as follows: sex, age,
underlying diseases including diabetes mellitus, the amount of
administered glucose (G [kcal/kg/day]), the amount of
administered insulin (I [U/kg/day]) from the AP, the rate of septic
patients, the severity (SOFA score), and the mortality (%).
Nutritional support for all the patients was performed with total
parenteral nutrition.
Results (1) E phase (1.2 ± 0.8 days [mean ± SD] after the
operation of AP, n = 84): group 200b (BGm: 173 ± 19, n = 68)
had lower G (23.4 ± 6.8 vs 27.4 ± 8.3, P < 0.05), I (1.11 ± 0.73
vs 2.47 ± 1.34, P < 0.001), and lower mortality (29 vs 56, P < 0.05)
as compared with group 200a (BGm: 224 ± 22, n = 16). Other
parameters were not significantly different between group 200b
and group 200a. However, regarding the mortality, there was no
statistical difference between groups 175b and 175a, and
between groups 150b and 150a. (2) L phase (7.6 ± 1.4 days after
the operation of AP, n = 88): group 175b (BGm: 155 ± 18, n = 58)
had lower I (0.76 ± 0.58 vs 2.30 ± 1.19, P < 0.001) and lower
mortality (28 vs 50, P < 0.05) as compared with group 175a
(BGm: 197 ± 17, n = 30). Other parameters were not significantly
different between group 175b and group 175a. In this phase the
mortality was not statistically different both between groups 200b
and 200a, and between groups 150b and 150a.
Interpretation BG control has recently been widely accepted as
one of the most important therapies that improve outcome, which
was reconfirmed by our strict BG control using the AP. However,
the optimal BG goal remains to be elucidated. Our clinical trial
suggested that we should change the goal chronologically.
Conclusions BG control aiming at a BG level lower than
200 mg/dl at the early stage and lower than 175 mg/dl at about
1 week later may link to the improvement of outcome of the acutely
ill severe patients. The AP would be effective and essential for
improving the outcome as well as for the evaluation of BG control
and glucose tolerance through the strict BG control.

Introduction Implementation of an intensive insulin protocol (IIP)
aiming for tight glycaemic control (TGC) (blood glucose [BG]
4.4–6.1 mmol/l) resulted in a significant mortality reduction from
8% with conventional treatment to 4.6% in the IIP group [1].
Objective To determine the key factors that influence the degree
of control achieved by IIP.
Method We implemented an IIP in mechanically ventilated surgical
and medical patients, aiming for a target BG of 4.4–6.1 mmol/l.

Ethics approval was gained to conduct a prospective,
observational study in 50 patients who were treated with the IIP.
All measured BG results were analysed to calculate the time spent
in predefined BG bands. Univariate and multivariate analyses were
conducted on key baseline characteristics and the percentage
time in the target band, using SPSS version 13 software.
Results In the univariate analysis, significant results were seen for
BMI (R2 = 13.1% P = 0.01), previous diabetes (R2 = 10.2%
P = 0.02) and gender (R2 = 7.1% P = 0.06). The APACHE II
score, age, drugs affecting glycaemia and percentage of correctly
timed assays did not explain the variability in the percentage time in
the target TGC range.
The multivariate analysis identified BMI as a significant factor
(Table 1). Taken together, the factors in Table 1 explain 22.4% of
the variability.

Gender –5.7 –12.5 to 1.1 0.096
Drug interactions 4.8 –2.4 to 12.0 0.184
Conclusion BMI was inversely related to control of glycaemia.
Diabetics had worse glycaemic control than nondiabetics. Women
had better TGC than men. The BMI, previous diabetes, gender and
interacting drugs explained 22.4% of the variability in achieving
TGC targets.

An altered glucose concentration increases plasma
membrane injury in alveolar cells
S Ensminger, N Vlahakis
Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P245 (doi: 10.1186/cc4592)
Introduction Lung injury has been associated with such insults as
inflammation, infection, transfusion of blood products and mechanical
ventilation with high tidal volumes (VALI). In the critically ill,
intensive control of hyperglycemia with insulin results in decreased
mortality and length of ICU stay. Whether or not abnormal glucose
concentration contributes to VALI is unknown. The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the role of an altered glucose environment in
lung cell injury.
Methods In in-vitro experiments, rat type II alveolar cells were
cultured on a flexible membrane in the presence of low
(100 mg/dl), normal (400–500 mg/dl) and high (700 mg/dl)
glucose concentrations (standard growth media = 400 mg/dl).
Cells were stretched by deforming the membrane cyclically eight
times per minute for 2 min. Cell stretch was performed in the
presence of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, a marker of plasma
membrane injury and reseal. Following cell stretch, cells were
labeled with propidium iodide (PI), a marker of cell death. Cell
injury was expressed as the number of injured and dead cells over
the total number of cells.
In in-vivo experiments, isolated rat lungs were mechanically
ventilated with injurious tidal volumes (initial tidal volume 40 ml/kg,
adjusted to initial peak airway pressure = 25 cmH2O) for 25 min
while perfused with Kreb’s solution of normal (120 mg/dl) or high
(500 mg/dl) glucose concentration. PI was added to the perfusate
during injurious ventilation. The number of labeled subpleural cells
was measured and reported as an injury index (labeled
nuclei/number of alveoli in each view field).
Results At a glucose concentration lower than that found in
standard type II cell growth media, there was increased injury
following cell stretch (27.6% vs 18.9%, P = 0.01). At higher
glucose concentrations cells no longer were adherent to the
deformable membrane, which is a strong marker of nonviability. In
rat lungs perfused with high-glucose Kreb’s solution during
injurious ventilation there was significantly greater injury than in
lungs perfused with normal glucose Kreb’s solution (28.0% vs
10.1%, P < 0.01).
Conclusions States of altered glucose homeostasis result in
increased cell injury in both cell stretch and isolated lung models of
injurious ventilation. These findings highlight the importance of tight
glucose control in the lung cell environment to ensure the integrity
of the alveolar capillary membrane. They also suggest that cell
injury and resulting alveolar–capillary leakiness may explain the
worse clinical outcome and increased incidence of bacteremia
seen in critically ill patients with hyperglycemia. Further study is
warranted to define the mechanism through which altered glucose
homeostasis contributes to lung cell injury and VALI.

Improved hepatic glucose production in mice lacking
inducible nitric oxide synthase during hyperdynamic septic
shock
E Barth, P Radermacher, J Vogt, M Georgieff, G Albuszies
University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P246 (doi: 10.1186/cc4593)
Introduction We recently showed in a hyperdynamic mouse model
of septic shock that endogenous glucose production is depressed
[1]. However, the mechanism for this depression remains unclear.
In this context, the role of excess NO release due to activation of
the inducible isoform of the NO synthase (iNOS) has been
controversially discussed: while Stadler reported a direct relation
between excess NO release and the inhibition of gluconeogenesis
[2], other authors did not demonstrate any NO effect [3]. We
therefore investigated the effects of genetic iNOS deletion on
hepatic glucose production in a clinically relevant murine model of
normotensive, hyperdynamic, volume-resuscitated septic shock.
Wild-type mice served as controls.
Materials and methods Fifteen hours after induction of sepsis by
cecal ligation and puncture, mice were anesthetized, mechanically
ventilated and instrumented using a central venous line, ultrasound
flow probes on the portal vein (PV) and the superior mesenteric
artery (SMA), and combined laser Doppler flowmetry and remission
spectroscopy to assess macrocirculatory and microcirculatory blood
flows and tissue oxygenation. Normotensive, hyperdynamic hemo-
dynamics were achieved by fluid resuscitation with colloids and intra-
venous noradrenaline (NA) titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure
(MAP) >70 mmHg. Stable, nonradioactive isotope-labeled 1,2,3,4,5,
6-13C6-glucose was infused to calculate the rate of gluco-
neogenesis [1] from isotope enrichment in a liver specimen taken at
the end of the experiment. Data are the median (range), analysed
using Mann–Whitney rank sum tests (intergroup differences).
Results In iNOS knockout mice, the target MAP was achieved
with less than 20% (P < 0.001) of the NA infusion rate required in
wild-type mice. SMA and PV flow were significantly lower in iNOS-
deficient mice; however, all parameters of gut and liver
microcirculatory perfusion and oxygenation were well maintained.

S104
Hepatic glucose production was significantly increased in iNOS
knockout mice compared with wild-type mice in septic shock (4.3
[3.2–8.4] vs 1.9 [0.4–2.9] mg/g*hour, P < 0.001) despite reduced
NA infusion rates.
Conclusions Since hepatic microvascular perfusion and
oxygenation were well maintained in iNOS-deficient mice, our
results of improved hepatic glucose production during hyper-
dynamic, volume-resuscitated septic shock support the concept
that an iNOS-mediated inhibition of cellular energy metabolism
rather than a deficiency in oxygen supply contributes to hepatic
dysfunction in septic shock.

Introduction Proteomic platforms allow one to detect changes in
the proteome of tissues. They can be combined with the use of
stable isotope-labelled tracer amino acids to detect changes in the
synthesis or breakdown rate of individual proteins. An ideal
complement to these data would be a characterization of the
metabolism. We focus on the defense against oxidative stress,
which is closely related to energy metabolism. The latter can be
assessed using isotope-labelled 1,2,3,4,5,6-13C6-glucose and
following the metabolic fate of the labelled carbons. We therefore
investigated whether an in-vivo septic animal model with labelled
glucose would provide useful data about glucose and energy
metabolism and whether the same tracer set up could be used to
reliably estimate the turnover of individual proteins.
Methods In a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model
anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated mice were infused over
8–10 hours with labelled glucose and then liver samples were
taken. Samples from five septic and five sham-operated mice were
analysed by 2D-Page gel electrophoresis/Maldi TOF mass
spectrometry, and the turnover of individual proteins was
determined [1]. The same samples were also used for isotopomer
analysis of glutamate and glucose to assess glucose production
and oxidation via the Krebs or citric acid cycle [2]. Comparisons
were based on Mann–Whitney rank sum tests.
Results Endogenous glucose production significantly decreased
from 3.1 (CLP) to 1.6 (sham) mg/g/hour. Glucose oxidation via acetyl-
CoA and subsequent use in the Krebs cycle was significantly
reduced under sepsis. Metabolic labelling via glucose resulted in
extensive labelling of glucose, glutamate and alanine such that
30–70% of the molecules had more than two carbons simultaneously
labelled. It was sufficient to detect sepsis-induced changes in the
protein labelling and their fractional synthesis rate: HSC71, a
constitutive chaperone, had a reduced rate, the heat shock proteins
HSP60 and HSP70 showed a minor increase, and protein disulfide
isomerase, a protein repair enzyme, showed a significant increase.
Conclusions Metabolic labelling with glucose allows one to
simultaneously assess key parameters of glucose metabolism and
changes in the dynamics of individual proteins. The combined
measurements allow a fine-grained characterization of sepsis and
can be used to link changes in the energy metabolism to changes
in the dynamics of individual proteins.

Organ dysfunction in critical illness: impact of maintaining
normoglycemia and glycemia-independent insulin actions

Introduction Tight glycemic control by intensive insulin therapy
(IIT) reduces mortality and risk of organ failure in critically ill
patients. The relative impact of maintaining normoglycemia and of
glycemia-independent actions of insulin in explaining these clinical
benefits remains unknown.
Methods In a TPN-fed rabbit model of prolonged (7 days) critical
illness we assessed the impact of normoglycemia/normoinsulin-
emia, normoglycemia/hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia/normoinsulin-
emia and hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia on survival and organ
function. Assessment of myocardial function (dp/dtmax) was
performed under mechanical ventilation on day 7. Aortic rings were
isolated to quantify endothelium-dependent relaxation by relaxation
to cumulative doses of acetylcholine (Ach), Ach + L-nitro-arginine-
methyl-ester and nitroprusside, respectively, of norepinephrine
(NE)-induced vasoconstriction. Leukocyte function and plasma
markers of kidney and liver function were measured.
Results Both normoglycemic groups revealed a mortality rate of
11%, whereas mortality was 36% in the HG/NI group and 47% in
the HG/HI group (P = 0.03). Left ventricular contractility was
increased by high insulin levels exclusively when normoglycemia
was maintained (P < 0.05). The two normoglycemic groups
revealed largely sustained endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation,
as compared with both hyperglycemic groups (P < 0.05), indepen-
dently of insulinemia. Nitroprusside-induced relaxation was not
affected. Leukocyte function as well as kidney and liver function
were protected only in both normoglycemic groups and deterior-
ated in both hyperglycemic groups (P < 0.05).
Conclusion Survival benefits and prevention of organ dysfunction
by IIT largely depend on glycemic control rather than on glycemia-
independent actions of insulin. When normoglycemia is
maintained, insulin might exert a glycemia-independent effect on
myocardial contractility.

has recently proven to ameliorate intensive care outcome and to
prevent polyneuropathy. However, direct toxicity of glucose on
neurons is hardly investigated
Methods Cultured neuroblastoma cells (with stauroporine for
differentiation) were incubated with different amounts of glucose,
starting from a concentration of 30 mM. Cultures were pretreated
with placebo, nerve growth factor (NGF) or insulin-like growth
factor-I (IGF-I). Survival was measured by the luminescent cell
viability assay and the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
was measured using JC-1 fluoroscopy.
Results Differentiated SHSY cells died in 150 mM glucose over the
3-day period measured. Doses of mannitol to obtain comparable
osmolality with the different glucose concentrations used resulted in
a significant lower cellular mortality. MMP started to decrease at day
1 from 125 mM glucose. Cellular survival, measured at 1–3 days,
was positively influenced by adding IGF-I (0.01–100 ng/ml) to the
200 and 300 mM glucose medium. NGF (same doses) also
improved survival but was less potent, especially in the higher
ranges of glucose. NGF, but not IGF-I, attenuated the MMP
decrease elicited by high glucose concentrations.
Conclusion Neuroblastoma cell death is dose-dependently
influenced by increasing doses of glucose. The decreased cellular
production of ATP, as measured by MMP, possibly participates in
cell death. Neuronal growth factors were able to improve cell
survival, but their effects on MMP differ. The clinical relevance of
these findings needs further investigation.

Introduction Kidneys transplanted from brain dead donors have a
poorer function and a higher risk of rejection than kidneys from living
donors [1]. This might partly be due to the inflammatory changes in
the kidneys after brain death [2]. In a previous porcine study we
found that a high-insulinaemic–euglucaemic clamp modulated the
renal cytokine response to lipopolysaccharide infusion towards anti-
inflammation [3]. We hypothesized that insulin in brain death would
give a similar cytokine response, and tested this hypothesis in brain-
dead pigs by studying the effect of insulin on renal IL-6 content.
Methods In 16 anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated pigs
(38–42 kg bw) brain death was induced by inflation of an epidurally
placed balloon catheter. Eight pigs received insulin at a constant
rate (0.6 mU/kg/min). Blood glucose was clamped at 4.5 mmol/l
by infusion of 20% glucose. The kidneys were removed 6 hours
after brain death and biopsies from the renal cortex and medulla
were taken for measurements of IL-6, by ELISA (pg/mg total
protein) and of IL-6 mRNA by PCR (optimal density ratio IL-6/
HRPT).
Results See Table 1. In the renal medulla IL-6 and IL-6 mRNA
were lower in the treated group, whereas in the cortex only IL-6
was lower.
Conclusions Insulin inhibits renal IL-6 production in brain-dead
pigs. This indicates that insulin treatment of organ donors might be
beneficial for kidney graft survival after transplantation.

Hemoglobin A1c predicts outcome of sepsis in patients
with diabetes

Introduction Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a widely used
marker of long-term glycoregulation in diabetes since it reflects
levels of glucose in the 120 days prior to measurement. A positive
impact of strict glucose control on the outcome of diabetic patients
with sepsis has been well established, but the influence of
glycoregulation prior to the occurrence of sepsis has not been
investigated in relation to outcome. Nonenzymatic glycation and
formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are
associated with chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes and have many
biochemical and cellular effects, including changes in immune and
inflammatory responses. Our hypothesis was that such changes
could influence the outcome of sepsis.
Methods A prospective, single-center, observational study included
adult patients admitted with sepsis and a history of diabetes during
a 1-year period. HbA1c was measured on the first hospital day and
the result did not influence treatment. APACHE II and SOFA
scores were calculated for all patients at admission. Complications
of diabetes (renal, vascular and ocular) were noted. WBC, CRP
and blood culture results were recorded. The hospital mortality and
hospital length of stay (LOS) were used as measures of outcome.
Nonparametric tests, multiple regression and logistic regression
were used in statistical analyses.
Results The study included 286 patients admitted to medical
wards or the medical ICU. Hospital mortality for all patients with
sepsis was 21.7% with a median LOS of 6 days (95% CI
6–7 days). Patients who survived had significantly (P < 0.001)
lower HbA1c (median 8.2%; 95% CI 7.8–8.6%) than patients who
died (median 9.75%; 95% CI 8.7–10.6%). A correlation was
found between the HbA1c values and patient’s LOS (r = 0.289,
P < 0.001). In a logistic regression model HbA1c was found to be
related to lethal outcome (OR 1.36; P < 0.001), together with
APACHE II score (OR 1.08; P = 0.014) and SOFA score (OR
1.27; P < 0.001) and female sex (OR 2.223; P = 0.032). In a
multiple regression model HbA1c was found to relate to LOS
(P < 0.001) together with APACHE II (P = 0.015) and SOFA
(P < 0.001) scores, age (P = 0.032), female sex (P = 0.033) and
WBC (P = 0.048).

Conclusion HbA1c was shown to be predictive of mortality and

Chronic hyperglycemia and consequent increased AGE formation
may influence inflammatory and immune responses, and thus be
responsible. Proper glycoregulation in diabetic patients could
reduce the risks in the event of infection.

Expression of glucose transporters in critical illness
L Langouche, S Vander Perre, P Wouters, G Van den Berghe

Stress-induced hyperglycemia is a significant problem in critically ill
patients, for whom the severity of hyperglycemia and insulin
resistance reflects the risk of death. We recently demonstrated
that strict maintenance of normoglycemia with intensive insulin
therapy during intensive care reduced the morbidity and mortality
of surgical ICU patients [1]. Normal cells respond to hyperglycemia
by downregulating the insulin-independent glucose transporters
(GLUT1, GLUT2 and GLUT3), thereby protecting themselves
against passive glucose overload. Insulin is known to upregulate
muscle GLUT4 expression, required for controlled glucose uptake
in the muscle. We investigated expression levels of these four
GLUTs in critical illness and assessed the impact of intensive
insulin therapy.
We examined mRNA expression levels with real-time RT-PCR in
muscle and liver tissue of 36 nonsurvivors, who had been
randomized to intensive (normoglycemic) or conventional (hyper-
glycemic) insulin therapy and who were comparable for age and
severity, duration and type of critical illness. The mean blood
glucose levels were 5.6 ± 0.4 and 9.9 ± 0.9 mmol/l (P < 0.001) on
a median daily insulin dose of 44.2 and 14.4 IU (P = 0.005),
respectively. For comparison, we studied tissue harvested from
patients undergoing acute surgical stress as well as tissue from
healthy controls.
We demonstrated that in both the liver and muscle of patients with
prolonged critical illness, the high-affinity insulin-independent
glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3 are substantially up-
regulated. In muscle the GLUT4 expression is reduced, reflecting
insulin resistance. In liver, intensive insulin therapy suppresses
GLUT2 with no effect on the other GLUTs. In muscle, intensive
insulin therapy downregulates GLUT1 and GLUT3 expression
whereas GLUT4 expression is normalized.
In conclusion, expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 is upregulated
and GLUT2 expression is normal in prolonged critical illness, a
constellation that may predispose cells to glucose overload and
toxicity, and that can be beneficially affected by intensive insulin
therapy. Expression of GLUT4, by far the most dominantly
expressed transporter in muscle, is low in the critically ill and is
normalized by intensive insulin therapy. Together, these findings
may offer an explanation for the high vulnerability to glucose toxicity
during critical illness and how intensive insulin therapy may prevent
this.

Introduction The influence of the plasma glucose levels on the
prognosis of infection is unclear. The aim of this clinical trial is to study
the impact of the plasma glucose levels at the onset of bacteremia
(PGLOB) on the prognosis of bacteremia in ICU patients.
Methods We studied retrospectively 202 bacteremic ICU patients
(143 men, 59 women). Mean age: 49.3 ± 16.9 years. Mean stay:
25.2 ± 11.1 days. Underlying diseases: multiple trauma 131,
complicated surgery 52, other 19. All were mechanically ventilated
and developed a nosocomial infection (NI) with at least one
positive blood culture. From 202 patients, 34 (16.8%) were
diabetic. The PGLOB (at the exact moment of the first positive
blood culture) was measured and was related to prognosis of NI.
Results In diabetic patients the mean PGLOB was 244.5 ± 103.4
mg%, while in nondiabetic patients it was 141.3 ± 58.4 mg%.
Global mortality rates (MR): 48/202 = 23.8%. From 48 patients
who died, in 37 death was associated with NI with bacteremia;
they had mean PGLOB 158.3 ± 91.1 mg%. The other 11
nonsurvivors had 153.4 ± 74.3 mg%. The related MR to NI and
bacteremia according to PGLOB were: <75 mg%, MR 33.3%;
75–140 mg%, MR 20.1%; 141–200 mg%, MR 24.5%;
>200 mg%, MR 27.1% (P = 0.32).
Conclusion There was no significant relationship between
PGLOB and mortality attributed to NI and bacteremia. Multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome was observed more frequently in
patients with PGLOB >200 mg%, but not significantly. MR was
similar in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients.

Background and aims Tight glycaemic control (TGC) has proven
to reduce mortality and morbidity in critically ill patients. However,
in many ICUs implementation of TGC in daily practice is still
suboptimal due to the risk of hypoglycaemia and the increased
work demands for the ICU nursing staff. Continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) in the interstitial fluid (ISF) might be an
alternative to improve the adjustment of insulin therapy without
causing additional workload. The aim of the study was to
investigate CGM in the ISF in ICU patients using a microdialysis-
based monitoring system.
Materials and methods Twenty patients (male/female: 15/5; age
69 ± 7 years, nondiabetics/diabetics: 14/6; BMI 28.2 ± 4.9 kg/m2,
APACHE II score: 11.0 ± 3.5) with a glucose level higher than
6.7 mmol/l were investigated in ICU after cardiothoracic surgery. A

microdialysis catheter (CMA 60), which is part of the SCGM1
system (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), was inserted
into the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the abdomen. In all
patients, arterial glucose was measured hourly to describe the
glucose profile until the end of the ICU stay, but for a maximum
period of 48 hours.
Results The mean duration of glucose monitoring was 36 ± 15 hours.
Eighteen out of 20 data could be analysed (two systems were
excluded due to technical failure of the system). The mean blood
glucose value was 7.2 ± 1.4 mmol/l (130 ± 25 mg/dl). The mean
Pearson correlation coefficient between blood and the SCGM1
system reading was rBG-SCGM = 0.808. In addition the
correlation for different calibration intervals (6–12–24 hours) of the
SCGM1 system was quantified with several evaluation methods
(method of residuals, modified error grid analysis [mEGA],
predicted error sum of the squares [%PRESS], mean absolute
difference [MAD], coefficient of correlation).

Conclusion Our data indicate that ISF is a promising site for CGM
in critically ill patients. An implementation of this approach is
microdialysis in combination with a glucose sensor. However,
systems still have to be improved to be suitable for routine care in
the ICU.

Introduction Critically ill patients frequently experience abnor-
malities in carbohydrate metabolism and a severe insulin resistance
state. Hyperglycemia is a negative predictor of outcome in these
patients, as high blood glucose (BG) values are associated with an
increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Currently, BG monitoring
methods cannot fulfill the need for continuous glucose monitoring
in order to safely implement tight glucose control protocols. The
purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of the NBM-100
device (OrSense Ltd) for non-invasive (NI) continuous glucose
monitoring in critically ill patients.
Materials and methods The NBM-100 uses a finger-based
sensor shaped as a ring, located at the finger’s base. Red/near-
infrared occlusion spectroscopy detects and analyzes BG and
hemoglobin concentrations. The NBM-100 utilizes an enhanced
optical signal resulting from a temporary over-systolic occlusion,
produced by a finger-based pneumatic cuff. The resulting changes
in the optical signal create the sensitivity needed for measuring the
glucose concentrations non-invasively.
A study was conducted on six patients (three female, three male,
ages 44–88 years) in the ICU of Rabin Medical Center upon
receipt of informed consent. The probe of the NBM-100 was
placed on the patients’ thumb, where it performed NI continuous
measurements for up to 24 hours, with readings every 10–15 min.
The results obtained from the NBM-100 device were compared
with arterial blood samples taken through an arterial line every
30–60 min and analyzed with a blood gas machine (ABL 700;
Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark).
Results A prospective analysis based on a uniform model with
personal parametric adjustments was performed on the NBM-100
readings, for a total of 80 data points. The calibration phase lasted
1.5–2.5 hours. The reference BG range was 64–247 mg/dl. The
resulting median relative absolute error was 11.5%, and the
median absolute error was 18 mg/dl. A Clarke error grid analysis
showed that 100% of the measurements fell within zones A (79%)
and B (21%). In all these clinical settings there was good patient
compliance and no adverse effects were identified. One of the
trials did not meet a self-consistency criterion for the calibration,
and was excluded.
Conclusion This study indicates the potential use of the non-
invasive NBM-100 as a device for continual, accurate, safe, and
easy-to-use BG evaluation for ICU. Consequently, it will improve
patient care and survival, as well as reducing staff workload. It has
the promise for trend analysis, hypoglycemia detection and closed-
loop systems enabling automatic glycemic control.

Introduction Implementation of an intensive insulin protocol,
aiming for tight glycaemic control (TGC) (BG 4.4–6.1 mmol/l), has
resulted in a significant mortality reduction from 8% with
conventional treatment to 4.6% in the TGC group [1]. An
observational study suggests that a less stringent target BG range
of 4–8 mmol/l may achieve mortality benefits [2].
Objective To determine the degree to which TGC can be
maintained using a TGC protocol.

S108
Method At our general adult 22-bed ICU, we implemented a novel
TGC protocol in mechanically ventilated patients aiming for a
target glucose range of 4.4–6.1 mmol/l. The protocol was
integrated on to the CIS by way of a decision support program.
Ethics approval was gained. A prospective, observational study
was carried out on 50 patients who were treated with the TGC
protocol. All measured BG results were transferred and analysed
to calculate the time spent in each predefined BG band. A linear
trend was assumed between individual measurements.
Results Fifty consecutive patients were analyzed. This involved
analysis of 7209 BG samples, over 9214 hours. The median time
to reach glycaemic control was 10.4 ± 2.7 hours. The target TGC
band (4.4–6.1 mmol/l) was achieved for a median of 23.1% of the
time that patients were on TGC. For the majority of time (48.5%),
BGs were within the band 6.2–7.99 mmol/l.
Conclusion Use of the computerised decision-supported intensive
insulin protocol did not achieve TGC for a prolonged percentage
of each patients stay, although it did deliver ‘normoglycaemia’
(4.4–7.99 mmol/l) for nearly three-quarters of the time. This
observational examination of a ‘real-life’ situation reveals that TGC
is difficult to achieve in critically ill patients.

shock and the effect of low-dose corticosteroid therapy

Introduction There is evidence for the usefulness of low-dose
corticosteroids for relative adrenal insufficiency in septic shock.
Treatment with low-dose corticosteroid was found to have
beneficial effects on hemodynamics and outcome. Relative adrenal
insufficiency is often diagnosed by the adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, but it is impossible to evaluate
the function of the whole hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis, so
there might be possibility to miss the patients who need steroids
due to disability of pituitary gland or hypothalamus.
Objectives We proposed a corticotropine releasing hormone
(CRH) stimulation test to evaluate the function of the pituitary
gland in patients with septic shock. We also examine the
usefulness of low-dose corticosteroid in a nonresponder to the
CRH stimulation test.
Methods One hundred micrograms of CRH is administered to a
patient with septic shock. A patient was recognized to be a
responder when the plasma concentration of ACTH raised up to
30 pg/dl or three times as high as the control level. For
nonresponders, hydrocortisone of 200 mg/day was administered.
We evaluated the 28-day mortality and the degree of reduction of
cathecolamine and vasopressin, considered as an improvement in
the circulatory status in each group.
Results Of 13 septic patients, three patients were determined as
responders and 10 as nonresponders to the CRH stimulation test.
For the latter group, hydrocortisone was used for nine patients and,
particularly, there were four patients who responded to the ACTH
stimulation test in this group. The 28-day survival rate was 33%
(1/3) for responders and 60% (6/10) for nonresponders, 66%
survived for 28 days who were given low-dose corticosteroid. We
could reduce the dose of cathecolamine and vasopressin during
72 hours after the administration of hydrocortisone. Dopamine
7.0 ± 6.6 to 2.0 ± 3.0 µg/kg/min (P = 0.077), dobutamine 1.8 ± 2.4
to 1.0 ± 2.0 µg/kg/min (P = 0.086), noradrenaline 0.106 ± 0.088
to 0.004 ± 0.013 µg/kg/min (P = 0.085) and vasopressin 0.13 ± 0.25
to 0.0 ± 0.0 U/kg/hour (P = 0.232).
Discussion Based on this study, it is suggested that there are
patients who need stress doses of corticosteroid due to
malfunction of the pituitary gland even though they responded
adequately to the ACTH stimulation test. We used hydrocortisone
in all nonresponders. For further details, administration of hydro-
cortisone should be examined by randomized, double blind-test,
but we think it is too critical to leave the nonreactive patient without
corticosteroid.
Conclusion We propose that the CRH stimulation test is useful to
assess the function of the pituitary gland of patients with septic
shock.

Background Corticosteroid supplementation based on cortisol
measurements was recently reported to decrease mortality in vaso-
pressor-dependent septic shock patients and to predict hemo-
dynamic response to corticosteroids. However, the prognostic
value and clinical significance of basal cortisol levels remains
controversial.
Objective To correlate basal cortisol levels with hemodynamic
response to corticosteroids and hospital mortality in patients with
septic shock
Design A prospective cohort study in a 19-bed medico-surgical
ICU in a private hospital.
Patients All 24 patients admitted with septic shock with basal
cortisol concentration measured, who received hydrocortisone as
part of the treatment of septic shock.
Measurements and results Five hundred and twenty-seven
patients were admitted to our ICU from September to November
2005; 24 (4.5%) were diagnosed with septic shock. After
measuring a basal cortisol level, we started intravenous hydro-
cortisone, 50 mg every 6 hours. The patients were divided into two
groups; those with hemodynamic response (HR+) to cortico-
steroids, defined as the reduction in noradrenaline dose greater
than 50% in the next 24 hours, and those with no response to
steroids (HR–). The mean age was 65 ± 15.75 years, and 58.3%
were male. The mean cortisol level was 32.29 ± 13.7 µg/dl. Nine
patients (37.5%) showed HR+ and seven (29.2%) patients died.
APACHE II scores were similar in the HR+ and HR– groups,
21.33 ± 11.68 and 22.53 ± 11.39(P = NS), respectively. The
mean cortisol basal level was 27.67 ± 13.75 µg/dl in the HR+
group and 35.06 ± 14.63 µg/dl in the HR– group (P = 0.159).
Cortisol did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors,
31.9 ± 12.9 and 33.2 ± 16.4 (P = 0.7), respectively. There was
also no correlation between hemodynamic response and survival.
Conclusions In this small cohort, cortisol basal levels were not
able to predict hemodynamic response to hydrocortisone in septic
shock patients or to differentiate survivors from nonsurvivors.

Objective To determine the risk factors for a low adrenocortical
response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in critically ill
patients.
Design A retrospective cohort study in the general ICU of a
university hospital.
Patients Five hundred and twenty consecutive critically ill patients
in a 3-year period, who underwent a 250 µg ACTH stimulation test
for RAI, because of hypotension or prolonged need for vaso-
pressor/inotropic therapy.
Methods The test was performed by i.v. injection of 250 µg
synthetic ACTH and measuring cortisol immediately before and 30
and 60 min after injection.
Measurements and results A low adrenal response was defined
as an increase in circulating cortisol <250 nmol/l and occurred in
60% of patients. Variables were collected at the onset of
admission and at the day of testing. Risk factors, in multivariate
analysis, included sepsis, positive local cultures if not from urine or
sputum, mechanical ventilation and high inspiratory O2 fraction,
metabolic acidosis, low platelets, absence of prior cardiovascular
disease or cardiac surgery, independently of baseline cortisol and
albumin levels. The baseline cortisol/albumin levels, as an index of
free cortisol, related directly and the increases inversely to the
sequential organ failure assessment score.
Conclusions In the critically ill, sepsis and its sequelae are major
risk factors of a low adrenocortical response to ACTH, independent
of baseline cortisol values and cortisol binding capacity in blood.
The data may help to delineate relative adrenal insufficiency.

The low-dose ACTH stimulation test represents an accepted
method to assess the adequacy of cortisol secretion. However, it
remains currently unclear whether this test is reproducible in the
setting of critical illness.
In this prospective study, we wished to investigate the
reproducibility of the low-dose ACTH stimulation test in a group of
severely ill patients.
To this end, 51 patients (40 men) with sepsis and/or septic shock,
having a median age of 59 years (range: 17–82 years) were
included. Two consecutive stimulation tests were carried out within
48 hours as follows: 1 µg freshly prepared tetracosactrin (1–24)
was administered as an intravenous bolus and 30 min later a
second blood specimen was obtained to measure stimulated
cortisol levels.
The first test revealed that baseline and stimulation cortisol levels were
19 ± 7 µg/dl and 25 ± 8 µg/dl, respectively. The second test showed
that baseline and stimulated concentrations were 19 ± 7 µg/dl and
24 ± 9 µg/dl, respectively. There was a good positive correlation
between cortisol responses obtained following the two stimulation
tests (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, r = 0.65, P < 0.005).
We conclude that in critically ill patients with sepsis and/or septic
shock, cortisol responses after stimulation with the low-dose test
are fairly reproducible. This suggests that a single stimulation may
be sufficient to assess adrenal function in such patients.

To date, the relationship between cortisol and dehydroepiandro-
sterone sulphate (DHEAs) levels upon admission and the severity
of disease in ICU patients remains controversial.
To further clarify this, 150 consecutive mechanically ventilated,
critically ill patients (120 men), with diverse underlying diagnoses,
having a median age of 50 years (range: 17–84 years) were
investigated. Severity of illness was assessed by the APACHE II
scoring system. Hypocortisolism was defined as cortisol below
15 mcg/dl. Upon admission to the ICU, blood was drawn to
measure cortisol and DHEAs. Median APACHE II score was 11
(range: 1-35). Hormonal measurements were as follows: median
cortisol and DHEAs levels were 16 µg/dl (range: 0–63 µg/dl) and
1335 ng/ml (range: 50–7238 ng/ml), respectively. Overall, 60
patients (40%) had hypocortisolism and 46 patients (31%) had
DHEAs levels below the local reference ranges (normal values:
800–5600 ng/ml). For the entire patient population, there was a
significant positive correlation between APACHE II scores and
cortisol concentrations (r = 0.33, P < 0.05). Furthermore, APACHE
II correlated negatively with DHEAs levels (r = –0.30, P < 0.05).
In conclusion, these data show a positive correlation between
APACHE II scores and cortisol concentrations. Also evident is the
negative correlation between severity of acute illness and DHEAs
levels.

The incidence of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis hypo-
responsiveness to stimulation and its relationship to cytokine levels
in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients remain controversial.
To further clarify these issues, 42 patients (33 men) with a median
age of 57 years (range: 16–81 years) were enrolled. Underlying
diagnoses included postoperative cases (n = 20), multiple trauma
without head injury (n = 12), pancreatitis (n = 4), and miscellaneous

(n = 8). Endocrine testing was performed 3–14 days (median:
6 days) after ICU admission. The median APACHE II score at the day
of endocrine testing was 15 and the mean SOFA score was 9 ± 4.
Morning blood samples were collected for the determination of
baseline cortisol, corticotropin (ACTH), and cytokines including IL-8,
IL-1, IL-6, IL-12p70 and TNF-α. Immediately after, a low-dose
stimulation test (LDST) was performed: 1 µg freshly prepared tetra-
cosactrin (1–24) was administered as an intravenous bolus and
30 min later a second blood specimen was obtained to measure
stimulated cortisol. Patients having stimulated cortisol levels less
than 20 µg/dl were defined as nonresponders to the LDST.
The mean baseline cortisol was 16 ± 6 µg/dl (range: 3–32 µg/dl).
The mean stimulated cortisol and the increment in cortisol were
and 21 ± 6 µg/dl (range: 11–42 µg/dl) and 6 ± 4 µg/dl (range:
0–20 µg/dl), respectively. The median ACTH was 19.0 pg/ml
(range: 2–300 pg/ml). Fifteen patients (36%) were nonresponders
to the LDST.
In the entire patient population median cytokine levels were as
follows: IL-8 = 133 pg/ml (range: 11–1010 pg/ml); IL-1 = 51 pg/ml
(range: 0–282 pg/ml); TNF-α = 1 pg/ml (range: 0–16 pg/ml); and
IL-12p70 = 8 pg/ml (range: 0–47 pg/ml). Nonresponders to the
LDST had higher values for IL-1 (45 pg/ml vs 16 pg/ml, P < 0.05)
and IL-12p70 (11 pg/ml vs 3 pg/ml, P < 0.05) compared with
responders. The two groups did not differ with regard to the other
cytokine concentrations.
In conclusion, adrenal cortisol secretion after dynamic stimulation
is deficient in about two-thirds of critically ill patients; this disorder
is associated with higher IL-1 and IL-12p70 levels.

Introduction Relative adrenal insufficiency has been described in
diverse critical ill states; however, this issue has not been investi-
gated following major abdominal surgery. The aim of the present
study was to gain insight on this topic.
Methods Thirty-two consecutive patients (16 men), with a mean
age of 69 ± 10 years, were enrolled. All patients underwent elective,
major abdominal surgery. Underlying diagnoses included carcinoma
of the intestine (n = 12), carcinoma of the stomach (n = 8), carci-
noma of the pancreas (n = 5), carcinoma of the esophagus (n = 1)
and abdominal aorta aneurysm (n = 6). Blood sampling was
performed preoperatively to measure morning baseline cortico-
tropin (ACTH) and cortisol levels. Furthermore, a low-dose (1 µg)
corticotropin stimulation test was carried out to determine
stimulated cortisol. The same measurements were performed on
the first postoperative day. Relative adrenal insufficiency was
defined as stimulated cortisol less than 18 µg/dl.
Results Preoperative measurements: median ACTH and mean
baseline cortisol were 13 pg/ml and 15 ± 5 µg/dl, respectively, while
stimulated cortisol was 25 ± 7 µg/dl. One patient (3%) had relative
adrenal insufficiency (stimulated cortisol was 16 µg/dl). Post-
operative results: median ACTH and mean baseline cortisol were
12 pg/ml and 17 µg/dl, respectively, whereas stimulated cortisol was
23 ± 12 µg/dl. Nine patients (28%) had relative adrenal insufficiency
(stimulated cortisol ranged from 12 to 17 µg/dl).
Conclusions Relative adrenal insufficiency occurs in a substantial
proportion of patients following major abdominal surgery. Pre-
operative adrenal function does not seem to determine post-
operative adrenal responses.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P264 (doi: 10.1186/cc4611)
Objective To explore the relationship of adrenal function and
prognosis in patients with severe sepsis.
Methods A prospective study between July and December 2004
in six teaching hospitals. Two hundred and forty patients with
severe sepsis were enrolled in this study. A short corticotropin
stimulation test was performed in all patients by intravenously
injecting 250 µg corticotropin. Blood samples were taken
immediately before the test (T0) and 30 min (T30) and 60 min
(T60) afterward, and the plasma cortisol concentration was
measured by radioimmunoassay. At the onset of severe sepsis, the
following parameters were recorded: age, sex, APACHE II, heart
rate, mean arterial pressure, PaO2/FiO2, arterial pH, peripheral
blood of hemoglobin, platelets and leukocyte concentration, and
the number of organ failures. Patients were divided into two groups
(survival and nonsurvival group) according to the 28-day mortality.
Relative adrenal insufficiency was defined as the difference between
T0 and the higher value between T30 or T60 (DTmax) < 9 µg/dl.
Results The 28-day mortality was 44.17%, and the rate of relative
adrenal insufficiency was 38.33%. Between the survival group and
nonsurvival group, the age, APACHE II, arterial pH, peripheral
blood of platelets, the number of organ failures, and T0 and DTmax
showed a significant difference. The mean T0 was 29.22 µg/dl, a
value of T0 lower than 29.22 µg/dl showed good outcome, and the
area under the ROC curve was 0.72. Using the reference value of
DTmax < 9 µg/dl, DTmax higher than 9 µg/dl was significantly
associated with death rates, and the area under the ROC curve
was 0.72. Three groups of patient prognoses were identified: good
(cortisol level at T0 < 29.22 µg/dl and DTmax > 9 µg/dl, 28-day
mortality rate 18.37%); intermediate (T0 > 29.22 µg/dl and DTmax
> 9 µg/dl or T0 < 29.22 µg/dl and DTmax < 9 µg/dl, 28-day
mortality rate 45.24%); and poor (T0 > 29.22 µg/dl and DTmax
< 9 µg/dl, 28-day mortality rate 86.21%).
Conclusion The base cortisol level and a short corticotropin
stimulation test had a good prognostic value for severe sepsis.

were (pmol/l): 18.06 ± 3.87, 10.32 ± 1.29, 19.35 ± 3.87; and
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were (mIU/ml): 5.0 ± 2.0,
4.8 ± 2.4 and 5.2 ± 3.0, respectively, in children with sepsis, with
septic shock, and controls. The TT3, FT3, TT4, and FT4 levels of
group SS were significantly lower than those of groups S and C.
The TT3 and FT3 levels of group S were lower than the levels of
group C, but there was no significant difference between TT4, FT4
levels of groups S and C. TSH levels were slightly decreased both
in sepsis and septic shock, but the difference was not significant
(P > 0.05). Eleven (21.6%) children with sepsis and 15 (71.4%)
children with septic shock died (P < 0.001). The levels of TT3,
FT3, TT4, and FT4 were impressively lower in nonsurvivors of
groups S and SS compared with survivors (P < 0.001).
Conclusions These changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary thyroidal
axis may suggest a possible prognostic value of thyroid hormone
levels in children with sepsis and septic shock. In addition, to the
best of our knowledge, this report is the first study to compare the
thyroid hormone levels in sepsis and septic shock in a large
number of patients with healthy controls in childhood.

Regulation of type 1 deiodinase activity in prolonged
critical illness
Y Debaveye, B Ellger, L Mebis, V Darras, G Van den Berghe
University of Leuven, Belgium
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P266 (doi: 10.1186/cc4613)
Introduction The low T3 syndrome invariably observed in
prolonged critically ill patients can be explained at least in part by
reduced hepatic type 1 deiodinase (D1) activity, whereby the T4
metabolism is shunted away from T3 production into inactive rT3.
Infusion of TRH, however, restores the catalytic activity of D1 and
concomitantly increases T3 to within the physiological range,
indicating that D1 activity during critical illness is regulated via
alterations within the thyroid axis [1].
It remains unknown, however, whether this observed reactivation of
D1 activity is due to either a direct effect of TRH or the induced
rise in circulating T4 and T3 concentrations.
Methods Burn-injured, parenterally fed, New Zealand White rabbits
were randomized to receive a 4-day infusion of saline, T4
(9 µg/kg/day), T3 (5 µg/kg/day), T4 + T3 or TRH (60 µg/kg/hour).
The doses of T4 and T3 aimed at, respectively, bringing plasma T4
and T3 levels into the range obtained by TRH infusion. Endocrine
and biochemical organ system markers were studied. Animals were
sacrificed for the assay of deiodinase activity in snap-frozen liver.
Results Compared with infusion of saline, rabbits receiving T4, T3
and TRH exhibited higher hepatic D1 activities and subsequent
elevated T3 levels. Coinfusion of T3 with T4, however, evoked an
additional increase in hepatic D1 activity (P = 0.07) with increased
T4 to T3 conversion as demonstrated by significantly lower T4
(P = 0.002, T4 + T3 vs T4), higher T3 (P = 0.004, T4 + T3 vs T3)
and lower rT3 levels (P = 0.001, T4 + T3 vs T4). Hepatic D1
activity was strongly correlated with plasma T3 (R = 0.871,
P < 0.0001) but not with T4, rT3 and TSH concentrations.
Conclusion D1 activity during prolonged critical illness is most
probably regulated via alterations in plasma T3.

Predictive factors of the development of acute renal failure
in the immediate post-hepatic transplant period
A Lopez-Lago, E Varo, S De Lange, J Garcia Acuña, E Ferrer
Hospital Clinico Universitario de Santiago, Santiago de
Compostela, Spain
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P267 (doi: 10.1186/cc4614)
Introduction The incidence of acute renal failure (ARF) in the
immediate post-hepatic transplant period is around 12–51%. The
aetiology is multiple. The ARF raises mortality of the hepatic
transplant up to 50% according to some series. That is why it is so
important to determine the factors that contribute to the develop-
ment of ARF and to try to correct these as quickly as possible.
Materials and methods We studied 102 patients who had
received an orthopic liver transplant (OLT) from a donor subject
during the past 5 years. We performed a follow-up of 6 months
with the aim of determining which factors are implicated in the
development of renal dysfunction in the immediate post-transplant
period. We analyzed characteristics of the donor, reasons for
transplantation, Child–Pugh stage, and cold ischemic time, number
of blood concentrates transfused during surgery, serology and
biochemical parameters of renal and liver function before
transplantation and at time of admittance to the ICU. We used
univariable and multivariable studies.
Results We studied 102 patients that had received an OLT, of
which 67.6% were male. The mean age was 52.58 years, and
52.08 years for the donors. The most frequent cause of brain death
was due to CVA. The most frequent aetiology of OLT was
alcoholic cirrhosis. Of the serologies, 33.3% were positive for HCV
and 72.3% for CMV. We found series of factors that influence the
development of ARF in the immediate post-transplant period:
patients with a negative serology for CMV (P = 0.005), patients
with hepatorenal syndrome before the transplantation (P = 0.001),
blood concentrates transfused during surgery (3.98 ± 3.84 in the
patients who did not develop ARF and 10.23 ± 8.28 in those who
did develop ARF) (P = 0.000), Child–Pugh stage (P = 0.000),
levels of urea and creatinine at the moment of admittance to the ICU
(P = 0.000 and P = 0.05, respectively), albumin level (P = 0.002),
total bilirubin level (P = 0.001), conjugated bilirubin (P = 0.000)
and the level of total proteins (P = 0.000)
Conclusions The development of ARF in the immediate post-
transplant period is more frequent in those patients with
hepatorenal syndrome before transplantation, with stage C of
Child–Pugh, with complications during surgery with the need for
blood transfusions and in those with low serum albumin and high
levels of bilirubin in the immediate post-transplant period.

Introduction The inclusion criteria for liver transplantation are
wider every time and that makes the waiting list longer and longer;
on the contrary, the organs from the donor subjects are limited.
That is why it is so important to select the candidates and to know
the predictive factors for success.
Materials and methods We studied 102 patients that had
received an orthopic liver transplant (OLT) from a donor subject
during the past 5 years. We studied the mortality during the 6-

month period post-transplantation. We analyzed variables of the
donor: age, gender, cold ischemic time and cause of death. We
evaluated the number of blood concentrates transfused during
surgery, age, gender, serology of the receptor, reason for trans-
plantation, stage according to the Child–Pugh classification and
biochemistry parameters of liver and renal function in the pre-
transplantation and immediate post-transplantation period. We
made a descriptive study and a statistical study, univariable and
multivariable, using Student’s t test and the chi-quadrate.
Results We present 102 patients that had received an OLT,
67.6% male and 32.4% female. The mean age of the receptors
was 52.58 years, and of the donors was 52.08 years. The most
frequent cause of brain death of the donor subject was due to CVA
(58.9%). The aetiology of liver failure was 50% due to alcoholic
cirrhosis, 20.6% due to HCV, 3.9% due to fulminate failure and
6.9% due to hepatocelullar carcinoma. According to the Child–
Pugh classification, 13.7% was in stage A, 43.1% in stage B and
33.3% in stage C. The HCV-positive percentage was 22.5%, and
13.7% was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus pre transplantation,
6.9% suffered from ischemic heart disease and 18.6% presented
a hepatorenal syndrome. During the immediate postsurgery period,
51% presented renal dysfunction.
We identified the following as prognostic factors of mortality: renal
dysfunction in the immediate postsurgery period (P = 0.001), cause
of death of the donor (P = 0.049) and aetiology of liver failure
(P = 0.028), with fulminant hepatic failure as the worse predictive
factor, followed by cirrhosis due to HCV. Also, the parameters of
liver function at the moment of admittance to the ICU: ASAT
(P = 0.006), ALAT (P = 0.002), albumin (P = 0.047), and total
proteins (P = 0.039).
Conclusions The hepatic and renal dysfunction at the moment of
admittance to the ICU are good predictors of mortality. Other
factors such as cause of brain death of the donor and the aetiology
of the liver disease are also to be taken into account in the initial
valuation and evaluation of the receptor.

Onassis Cardiac Surgery Center, Athens, Greece
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P269 (doi: 10.1186/cc4616)
Objective Biliary complications after cardiopulmonary bypass
procedures are infrequent but they carry a significant incidence of
morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to ascertain the
frequency of biliary complications following open heart surgery, to
determine possible preoperative risk factors and to identify that
early diagnosis and prompt institution of therapy are the most
important factors to improve the outcome.
Materials and methods Within 3 years, all patients (n = 4588) who
had undergone open heart surgery for a variety of cardiac lesions
were attended at the ICU of our institution and were examined
retrospectively for complications involving the gall bladder and biliary
tract. All case histories of the patients were subjected to meticulous
analysis. Patients with an indication of hepatic dysfunction, jaundice
or biliary disorders were excluded from this study.
Results Biliary complications occurred in 14 patients, 12 of whom
had to undergo subsequent abdominal surgery. Gangrene and
perforation of gallbladder was the most common complication (n =
5), followed by acute acalculous cholecystitis (n = 4), distension of
common bile duct without indications of biliary stasis and presence
of sludge (n = 3), cholelithiasis (n = 1) and empyema (n = 1). The
majority of patients presented within the third postoperative week
(21 ± 11 postoperative days). Clinical and laboratory findings
included a distended abdomen, elevated white blood cells,
elevated C-reactive protein and lactate levels, nonspecific changes
in the liver function chemistries and unexplained sepsis. A specific
preoperative diagnosis was established in 13 patients (93%).
Cholecystectomy was performed in five patients and percutaneous
drainage of gallbladder in seven patients. Two patients responded
well to conservative measures and diagnostic laparotomy was
avoided. Five patients had gangrenous gallbladders, with frank
perforation in two. The mortality rate was 43%. Biliary
complications correlated significantly with advanced age (66 vs
63.5 years), the male sex (men/women: 10/4), combined cardiac
surgical procedures (CABG ± valve replacement), preoperative
low cardiac output syndrome (EF < 45%), prolonged bypass time
(170 vs 107 min), aortic cross-clamp time (129 vs 68 min) and
mechanical ventilation (>48 hours), the usage of IABP, multiple
transfusions, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, visceral
hypoperfusion and ischemia, and the administration of inotropes
and other medications.
Conclusion Biliary complications after cardiac surgery are
uncommon but life-threatening and may result from hypoperfusion
of the gallbladder due to various factors. Clinical features are often
subtle, and a high index of suspicion is necessary for an early
diagnosis and for the institution of appropriate treatment. Delay of
operative management on the grounds of recent cardiac surgery is
not justified and is accompanied by an unacceptable mortality rate.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P270 (doi: 10.1186/cc4617)
Objective Acute pancreatitis (AP) remains a potentially life-
threatening disease and, despite international accepted treatment
guidelines, the management of AP differs among hospitals.
Methods This retrospective study analyzes all the complications
for 254 patients hospitalized in our department for AP in the past
10 years (1995–2004).
Results The analysis included 245 patients (55% men, age 57 ±
10 years). The aetiology of AP was alcoholic in 19.5% and biliary
in 58.9% of patients (other causes, 21.6%). Ten patients died of
septic multiorgan failure (mortality, 10/245; 4.1%). Severe
complications occurred in 53 patients (21.6%), including acute
renal failure in four, ileus in 19, and respiratory or cardiac failure in
13 patients. Eight patients needed emergency surgery. Sepsis
occurred in nine patients. Other complications were: pneumonia,
delirium, cholecystitis, diabetes mellitus, gastric or duodenal ulcers,
and pericardial effusion. Of 245 patients, 156 (63.7%) had at least
one complication. Mechanical ventilation, hemoperfusion, or
hemodialysis was rarely necessary. Computed tomography (CT)
was performed in 206 of 245 patients (84.1%) and showed
pancreatic necrosis in 47 patients (22.8%). C-reactive protein
during the first 48–72 hours and CT findings proved useful in
predicting the outcome in multivariate statistical analyses. By
logistic regression, however, complication rates were associated
with Ranson score, but not with CT findings, C-reactive protein,
sex, age, etiology, or serum enzymes.
Conclusions A conservative management of AP results in a low
rate of complications and mortality. Clinical assessment (Ranson
score) is sufficient to predict the severity of pancreatitis in most
patients. None of our patients with AP need any special treatment
and the cost-effective care is sufficient.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P271 (doi: 10.1186/cc4618)
Objective Serious local complications that can develop following
the acute phase of severe pancreatitis include abscess formation,
vascular injuries, and gastrointestinal (GI) perforations. These
complications are caused by extensive necrosis of fat in the peri-
pancreatic retroperitoneum that extends into the intraperitoneum/
retroperitoneum. The purpose of this study was to determine the
predictors of such local complications.
Materials and methods Forty-five consecutive patients who were
admitted to our ICU for acute pancreatitis were the subjects of this
study (male: 32, female: 13, age 51.4 ± 18.9 years). The following
parameters were assessed: Ranson score; APACHE II scores, SOFA
scores, and CRP levels on admission and day 7; and enhancement
CT findings on admission (first CT) and days 7–10 (second CT).
CT findings were assessed using the CT severity index of
Balthazar and colleagues. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results Twelve patients with acute pancreatitis developed local
complications. Five patients have GI perforations that accom-
panied abscess formations in three cases. Six patients have
vascular injuries (arterial rupture: five cases, venous rupture: one
case, venous occlusion: one case). The other patient developed
intraperitoneum abscess and sepsis. A laparotomy was performed
on two patients with colon perforations and one patient with an
intraperitoneum abscess. Transarterial embolization was performed
on five patients with arterial ruptures. Stomach and duodenum
perforations were treated with percutaneous drainage. Three
patients died during the study period: one from bleeding
associated with arterial rupture (day 51) and two from colon
perforations (days 17 and 162).
Ranson scores, APACHE II scores, SOFA scores, and CRP levels
of patients who had complications on admission (C group) were
5.2 ± 2.1, 12.7 ± 8.3, 5.4 ± 3.8, and 13.4 ± 10.6 mg/dl,
respectively, and those of patients who did not have complications
on admission (non-C group) were 3.0 ± 1.7, 7.6 ± 5.6, 2.8 ± 3.0,
and 6.6 ± 7.0 mg/dl, respectively. The Ranson, APACHE II, and
SOFA scores of the C group were significantly higher than those
of the non-C group. On day 7, APACH II scores, SOFA scores,
and CRP levels in the C group were 11.1 ± 6.7, 5.8 ± 3.8, and
20.3 ± 6.3 mg/dl, respectively, and for the non-C group were
4.5 ± 4.3, 1.7 ± 2.5, and 5.7 ± 5.1 mg/dl, respectively. The C
group had significantly higher scores and CRP levels than the non-
C group. Severity indices of the first and second CT observations
were 8.1 ± 1.8 and 8.2 ± 1.7, respectively, for the C group and
2.9 ± 1.3 and 2.6 ± 1.3, respectively, for the non-C group. Severity
indices were significantly higher in the C group.
A multivariate logistic regression analysis using a stepwise method
was performed to identify significantly independent factors
associated with the development of complications. As strong
correlations were observed among Ranson, APACHE II, SOFA
scores, CRP levels, and CT severity indices, we selected the day 7
APACHE II scores, the day 7 CRP levels, and the CT severity
indices on the second CT as variables. CT severity indices and
CRP levels were significantly independent factors (P = 0.03 and
0.41, respectively). An OR for developing complications was 3.6
when a CRP level increased by 5 mg/dl (95% CI: 1.1–10.7).
Similarly, the OR was 5.0 when a CT index increased by 2 points
(95% CI: 1.2–21.4).
Conclusion Persistent inflammatory reactions and high severity
indices on the second CT are considered significant predictors of
serious local complications associated with acute pancreatitis.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P272 (doi: 10.1186/cc4619)
Objective To study the clinical characteristics and prognostic
factors of patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) admitted to
a general purpose ICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital.
Materials and methods Case records of consecutive patients
with SAP admitted to the ICU from July 2002 to November 2005
were retrospectively reviewed. Collected data included the
demography, etiology, co-morbid illnesses, SOFA and APACHE II
scores at admission and after 24 hours, necrosis on CT scan,
organ failures and their management, infections, nutrition given,
specific interventions done and outcome. The patients were
distributed into survivor and nonsurvivor groups and the factors
determining outcome were analysed.
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 13 software; tests
used include ANOVA, the t test and the chi-square test.
Results Thirty-seven patients with SAP were identified; 13 of them
survived (‘survivor’ group) and 24 died (‘nonsurvivor’ group). Age,
sex, co-morbid illnesses and etiology of pancreatitis did not affect
the outcome. Patients with weight >70 kg had a poorer outcome.
The mean APACHE II scores at admission were 11.2 ± 5.4 and
20.1 ± 6.6, respectively, in the survivor and nonsurvivor groups
(P = 0.01) and SOFA scores were 4.6 ± 3.2 and 8.5 ± 4.3,
respectively (P = 0.004). The net change in the APACHE II scores
in 24 hours was –11 in the survivor group compared with –1 in the
nonsurvivor group (P < 0.001). The organ failures were
significantly higher in the nonsurvivor group as against the survivor
group. Severe pulmonary failure (lung injury score >2.5), renal
failure at admission and need for vasopressors/inotropes were
present in 15.4% vs 70.8%, 7.7% vs 62.5% and 23% vs 100% in
the survivor and nonsurvivor groups, respectively (P = 0.05,
<0.001 and 0.001, respectively). The mean number of days
patients required vasopressor/inotrope therapy, mechanical
ventilation and renal replacement therapy were significantly higher
in the nonsurvivor group. Also, the number of transfusions required
was higher. Nasogastric feeding was successful for a longer
duration in the survivor group.
The CT scan performed in 25 patients showed necrosis present in
24 patients (eight survivors and 16 nonsurvivors) while one
nonsurvivor had no necrosis. Necrosis >50% was associated with
a poor outcome (present in 1/8 survivors and 15/17 nonsurvivors,
P < 0.001). Drainage of necrosis was by percutaneous route or
surgically (open); three survivors and 13 nonsurvivors underwent
drainage. Five out of 8 survivors (62.5%) and 4/16 nonsurvivors
(25%) had sterile necrosis. Gram-negative enteric bacilli were the
common organisms encountered.
Conclusion SAP has a mortality of 64.8% even with ICU
management. Body weight >70 kg, high APACHE II score, organ
failures, especially pulmonary, cardiovascular and renal, and
pancreatic necrosis >50% are independent predictors of mortality.
A decrease in the APACHE II score in 24 hours identifies patients
with a good prognosis.

Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P273 (doi: 10.1186/cc4620)
Objective Acute liver failure (ALF) can show different demographical
characteristics in different countries. Liver transplantation is still the
life-saving treatment modality if performed in a timely manner in
patients who will not recover with supportive measures. Prognostic
criteria for pediatric ALF to discriminate children who will require
liver transplantation has not yet been established. We aimed to
evaluate the case for pediatric patients in Istanbul retrospectively.
Materials and methods The files of children with ALF diagnosed
during a 15-year period between 1991 and 2005 were reviewed
retrospectively. All the patients were re-evaluated to confirm the
diagnosis according to the current definition of ALF by an INR ratio
>2 and/or prothrombin time of 24 s or above and evidence of
acute liver disease (without any clinical stigmata of cirrhosis)
irrespective of the presence of encepalopathy. Thirty patients (17
boys, mean age 7.1 ± 4.9 years) with the diagnosis of ALF were
entered into comprehensive analysis. Clinical and laboratory data
were analysed as suggested in a previous European pediatric ALF
meeting held in Hamburg, October 2003. Possible prognostic
factors to determine the outcome, initial and worst laboratory
values were entered into relevant statistical analyses (SPSS
version 10.0, Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-square test, Fisher’s exact
test and Mann–Whitney U test were used to compare survivors
and nonsurvivors where appropriate. Pearson or Spearman tests
were used to investigate the correlations.
Results Jaundice was observed in 90% of the children. Hepato-
megaly existed in 40%, splenomegaly in 30% and ascites in 40%.
Fifty-three percent had grade I or grade II encephalopathy, whereas
20% already had grade IV encephalopathy on admission. The degree
of encephalopathy correlated with initial hematocrit, platelet counts
and prothrombin time as well as with the presence of splenomegaly
(P < 0.05 for all). Encephalopathy did not exist in 20% initially at all.
None of these clinical findings influenced the outcome statistically.
Mortality seemed higher in girls (69.2% vs 52.9%) and those diag-
nosed before the year 2000 (67% vs 50%), although the difference
was not statistically significant. Survival rates seemed higher in cases
of hepatitis A, hepatitis B and toxic hepatitis, whereas mortality was
highest in mushroom poisoning and fulminant Wilson’s disease.
The initial leucocyte count was higher (14,474 ± 7368 vs 10,390 ±
6208/mm3, P = NS); total and conjugated bilirubin were increased
(26.9 ± 14.9 vs 19.3 ± 19.3 mg/dl and 18.6 ± 12.1 vs 12.9 ±
14.0 mg/dl, P = NS) as well as BUN (16.1 ± 13.3 vs 10.3 ±
7.1 mg/dl, P = NS) among nonsurvivors. The INR was significantly
lower in the survivor group (4.4 ± 1.1 vs 3.1 ± 0.9, P < 0.05). The
maximal leucocyte count and maximal INR levels were significantly
higher among the nonsurvivors (19,623 ± 14,917 vs 11,680 ±
4483/mm3 and 4.9 ± 0.7 vs 3.8 ± 0.9, P < 0.05) whereas minimal
serum glucose levels were significantly lower (45.1 ± 28.2 vs 60.9 ±
14.5 mg/dl, P < 0.05).
Conclusion Hepatitis A, toxic hepatitis and fulminant Wilson’s
disease are the leading etiological factors in Turkish children with
ALF in Istanbul. The initial INR level seems to be the only prognostic
factor on admission. However, the maximal leucocyte count and INR
levels as well as minimal serum glucose levels during the hospital
stay may also have a role in determining the outcome. The outcome
of ALF seems to be improved after the year 2000 in our series,
possibly due to the improvement of intensive care facilities.

Hemolysis Elevated Liver Low Platelet Acute Renal
Dysfunction syndrome: evidence for a new entity in the
critically ill obstetric patient

Introduction The incidence of HELLP syndrome complicated with
acute renal failure (ARF) is unknown because of a paucity of large
series dealing with this subject. Recent experimental and clinical
investigations indicate that ARF presents a condition that exerts a
fundamental impact on the course of disease, the evolution of
associated complications and on prognosis independently from the
type and severity of the underlying disease.
Objective To test the pertinence of a new classification of HELLP
syndrome derived from the Tennessee Classification [1] and
containing renal dysfunction as a prognostic factor.
Patients and methods A retrospective analysis of the prospec-
tively collected data part of the APRiMo study [2]. Critically ill
obstetric patients first managed in tertiary referral maternity care for
high-risk pregnancies, then transferred to our independent
multidisciplinary ICU. Inclusion criteria: patients that developed
HELLP syndrome in prepartum or postpartum. The main outcome
of interest was vital status at ICU discharge. Demographic data,
obstetric management modalities, diagnosis of ICU admission,
SAPS-Obst, APACHE III-J, daily MODS and SOFA scores, and
ICU complications were collected. We used the following
classification. Complete HELLP syndrome (Class 1): platelets
< 100,000/mm3, LDH ≥ 600 UI/l, ASAT ≥ 70 IU/l. Incomplete
HELLP syndrome (Class 2): only one or two factors of the afore-
mentioned criteria. B: acute renal dysfunction, with a maximum
serum creatinine level between 100 and 200 µmol/l at day 1 of
ICU admission. C: ARF, with a maximum serum creatinine level
≥ 200 µmol/l at day 1 of ICU admission. A: no renal dysfunction.
Patients presenting with HELLP syndrome could therefore be
classified into six different categories.
Results During the study period January 1996–December 2004,
261 patients developed HELLP syndrome (21.1% mortality) from a
database of 640 patients (13.3% overall mortality) (Table 1). In a
logistic regression model with renal function represented by three
dichotomous variables and HELLP syndrome expressed in a dichoto-
mous manner as follows (Class 1 = 2, Class 2 = 1), B and C are
associated with a respective OR concerning mortality of 2.8 and 8.7.

Introduction HELLP syndrome is a specific complication of
pregnancy characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and
low platelet count. Frequently, the pregnant patient presents with
part of the biological disturbances that define HELLP syndrome,
which is commonly known as partial HELLP. Few studies have
focused on the specific prognosis of this condition.
Objective To compare morbidity and mortality related to partial
and complete HELLP syndrome [1].
Patients and methods Retrospective analysis of data collected
prospectively from an observational study (APRiMo study [2]).
Patients included were critically ill obstetric patients admitted to an
independent general ICU and that developed some or all of the
biological disturbances characteristic of HELLP syndrome. Study
period: January 1996–September 2004. The analysed data
involved: acute physiology score at day 1 of hospitalization in the
ICU, organ dysfunction, obstetric history and management
(transfusion, delivery mode, etc.), and major morbid events in the
ICU. The main outcome of interest was survival status at ICU
discharge. Patients were divided into three groups: partial HELLP
(P), complete HELLP (C) and patients without any criteria of
HELLP syndrome (NoH). Significance between groups was asses-
sed by two-tailed Pearson correlation, with P < 0.05 considered
significant. Results are expressed as means ± SD. Data were
computed using R version 2.1.
Results See Table 1.

Discussion and conclusion Complete HELLP showed a
significantly worse outcome than partial HELLP. But partial HELLP
was associated with a high rate of maternal mortality (15%) and a
significant increase in major morbid events during ICU
hospitalization. It is relevant to distinguish between partial and
complete HELLP syndrome (15% vs 40% mortality). Mortality in
the case of partial HELLP is still very elevated, sustaining
aggressive management as for complete HELLP.

Introduction Kidney function assessed by serum creatinine levels has
low sensitivity for detection of decreased kidney function because of
false-negative results. The aim of the study was to evaluate other
methods of assessment of kidney function and compare these with
the golden standard, the measured inulin clearance (GFR).
Methods The GFR and other kidney function assessments were
measured during a 24-hour period. The GFR was compared with
1-hour and 24-hour measured urinary creatinine clearance (Ccr1
and Ccr24), levels of cystatine C and β-trace protein, using five
equations for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on cystatine C
(Hoek, Larsson, Le Bricon, Filler, Sjöström), and equations for GFR
based on the creatinine level (Cockcroft Gault, MDRD, MDRDs,
Jelliffe). Bias was assessed by the mean difference between GFR
and different methods, precision by SD of the bias, and accuracy
by the proportion of patients for whom the difference in the GFR
was within 10% or 30% of the GFR (Acc10–30%).
Results Fifty patients were included, 64% were male, age was
56 ± 18 years, and APACHE II score was 19 ± 6. Creatinine was
0.66 mg/dl (0.45–1.58), cystatin C was 1.26 mg/dl (1.00–2.63)
and β-trace protein was 0.92 mg/dl (0.67–1.85). The GFR was 64
(20–98) (ml/min/1.73 m2); 72% of patients had GFR <90 and
48% had GFR <60. Bias was lowest for cystatin C-based
equations (range: 3–9), was intermediate for Ccr1 and Ccr24 (27
vs 17) and great for the four creatinine-based equations (range
33–196). Precision was low for all methods of GFR assessment
(range 28–141). Also, accuracy was low: Acc10% for all methods
ranged from 0% to 20%, and Acc30% from 2% to 50%. Cystatin C
and β-trace protein were better than creatinine levels for detection
of GFR <60 (ROC analysis: AUC = 0.95 vs 0.91 vs 0.87).
Conclusions Cystatin C and β-trace protein hold promise for
assessment of kidney function in ICU patients. Cystatin C and β-
trace protein performed better than creatinine for the detection of
kidney insufficiency. Also, GFR assessed on cystatin C-based
equations were better than Ccr (low bias); however, they also
lacked precision and accuracy.

Validation of the Cockroft–Gault formula for estimation of
creatinine clearance in the critically ill population

Background Estimation of creatinine clearance by the
Cockroft–Gault (CG) formula is used in daily practice to calculate
the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in critically ill patients. This
formula was derived from a cohort of noncritically ill patients and
has not been validated against a standard measurement of the GFR
such as 24-hour urine creatinine clearance in the critically ill patient.
Objective To quantify the discrepancy in GFR estimated by the
CG formula and 24-hour urine creatinine clearance.
Method A prospective cohort study was conducted in 50 adult
patients in a mixed medical–surgical ICU. Inclusion criteria were
ITU stay >48 hours and indwelling urinary catheter. Exclusion
criteria were age <18 years, pregnancy, hemodialysis or peritoneal
dialysis, urine output <400 ml/day and patients receiving

cimetidine, ranitidine, cefoxitin, trimethoprim or diuretics. We
estimated the GFR by the CG formula and measured the GFR by
the 24-hour urine creatinine clearance. A Bland and Altman plot
was used to find the percentage difference between the paired
observations. The association between the two methods was
measured by the product moment correlation coefficient.
Results The mean GFR estimated by the CG formula was 95.19
(CI) and that by 24-hour urine creatinine clearance was 90.69 (CI).
The bias as measured by the mean percentage of error (MPE) and
the precision as measured by the mean absolute percentage of
error (MAPE) between these two methods were –8.07 and
103.18, respectively. The correlation coefficient of the CG formula
as a measure of the GFR was 0.65 (P < 0.0001).
Conclusion We conclude that CG formula has a strong correlation
with the measured GFR but is not a reliable measure and
overestimates the GFR in the critically ill population.

Acute renal failure (ARF) determines a worse prognosis in various
medical scenarios. Since the syndrome of ARF can potentially
interfere with the weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV), we
sought to investigate whether the presence of ARF has any impact
on weaning from MV. We studied 140 patients who received
invasive MV for at least 48 hours in an oncologic ICU. Exclusion
criteria: neurosurgical patients, pulmonary resections or strict end-
of-life care. ARF definition: at least one value of serum creatinine
(SCr) ≥1.5 mg/dl during the ICU stay. Patients were divided into
ARF (n = 93) and non-ARF groups (NRF, n = 47). Criteria for
weaning: PEEP ≤8 cmH2O, pressure support ≤10 cmH2O, FiO2
≤0.4 and spontaneous respiration. Primary endpoint: length of
weaning. Secondary endpoints: length of MV, length of stay in ICU,
and mortality. Groups were similar regarding age and gender. A
higher number of ARF patients had hematological tumors (19.3 vs
6.4%, P = 0.04). The diagnosis of acute respiratory insufficiency
(45 vs 44%) during the ICU stay and the diagnosis of ALI/ARDS
as a cause for MV (18.2 vs 10.6%) did not differ between groups.
SAPS at entry was not different (48.1 ± 1.4 vs 43.5 ± 15.1) but
ARF patients had markers of more severe disease in the long term:
severe sepsis or septic shock (P < 0.0001); higher number of
antibiotics (P = 0.0018); longer time of vasoactive drug (VAD)
usage (P = 0.0005). Oliguria (urine output <500 ml/day, for at
least 24 hours) was found in 47% of ARF patients, with the median
time of 72 hours. SCr at ICU admission in the ARF group was
1.6 ± 0.1 mg/dl vs 0.7 ± 0.03 mg/dl in NRF. The total length of MV
was higher in ARF patients (13 ± 11 vs 9 ± 6 days, P = 0.017).
Moreover, ARF patients used higher levels of FiO2 (highest FiO2
80, IQ 50–100 vs 65, IQ 50–100, P = 0.024). Less ARF patients
reached criteria for weaning (42 vs 60%, P < 0.05), and had
longer length for weaning from MV (83 ± 105 vs 33 ± 45 hours,
P = 0.012). Cox regression analysis showed that an 85% increase
in SCr (HR 2.30, CI 1.3–4.08), the presence of oliguria (HR 2.51,
CI 1.24–5.08) and number of antibiotics greater than four (HR
2.64, CI 1.51–4.63) independently predicted weaning failure. The
length of ICU stay (15 ± 12 vs 11 ± 7 days) and ICU mortality (67
vs 43%) were significantly higher in ARF patients. Multivariate
analysis showed that oliguria (OR 27.3, 7.42–100.5), ARF (OR
2.43, 1.16–4.74) and prolonged use of VAD (OR 4.42,
1.28–15.2) were independent risk factors for mortality.
Increases in SCr, and particularly oliguria, during the ICU stay
seriously impact on the duration of MV, weaning from MV and
mortality in ICU patients. Although the presence of ARF appears to
be a marker of a more severe condition, it is an independent
negative factor for mechanically ventilated cancer patients.

Three-year outcome of severe acute tubular necrosis: a
prospective study of critically ill patients

University Hospital München, Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P279 (doi: 10.1186/cc4626)
Introduction Severe acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in critically ill
patients is associated with considerable morbidity, mortality and
use of health resources. Its precise long-term outcomes, however,
have not been well described. The objectives of this observational
study were to establish long-term survival and renal recovery for
severe ATN in a well-defined population.
Methods Four hundred and twenty-five critically ill patients with
hospital-acquired ATN necessitating renal replacement therapy
(RRT) during 1992 and 2001 were followed up for 3 years. RRT
was either intermittent hemodialysis or continuous RRT. No patient
had chronic renal dysfunction prior to ARF. Patients were classified
according to the cause of ATN as surgical or medical. ATN was
categorized as ischemic, septic or nephrotoxic. Patient
characteristics were documented at commencement of RRT. Major
outcomes (survival and renal status) were determined at discharge
and after 1 and 3 years of follow-up.
Results The study population was characterized by high age (mean
65 years), excess comorbidity and by extensive organ failure (mean
2.4 failed organs). The overall inhospital, 1-year and 3-year case
fatality rates were 47%, 65% and 71%, respectively. All survivors
had renal functional recovery without further need of RRT at
discharge and only 0.6% progressed to end-stage renal disease
after 1 year. After 3 years, 2% of the survivors needed chronic RRT.
Conclusions In contrast to the poor inhospital prognosis of
critically ill patients with severe ATN, the overwhelming majority of
surviving patients become independent from renal replacement
therapy. In patients without pre-existing renal dysfunction, severe
chronic renal failure is unusual and the persistent need for
maintenance hemodialysis is rare.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P280 (doi: 10.1186/cc4627)
Objective To describe bloodstream infection epidemiology in
cardiac patients undergoing hemodialysis admitted to ICUs.
Methods We analyzed epidemiological data of laboratorial-
confirmed bloodstream infection (BSI) episodes occurring in
patients undergoing hemodialysis from October 2004 to March
2005. BSI criteria were defined by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. The presence of uncuffed, nontunneled, temporary
central catheters for hemodialysis and other central venous catheters
was daily monitored. BSI episodes were classified as dialysis-related
when they occurred within 48 hours after this procedure.
Results There were 20 BSI episodes in 16 patients among the
168 (9.5%) who underwent hemodialysis in that period. The mean
age was 73.5 ± 9.8 years and the mean ICU length of stay before
BSI was 31.5 days. Eight patients (50%) were in the postoperative
period. At hospital admission five (31%) patients had normal renal
function, nine (56%) presented acute nondialytic chronic renal
failure and only one had dialytic chronic renal failure. Sixteen
episodes (80%) were hemodialysis related: 10 (62.5%) after
continuous vein–venous hemodialysis (low-flux hemodialysis) and
six (37.5%) after classic hemodialysis (high-flux hemodialysis).
There was no statistically significant difference between these two
procedures (P = 0.51). The most common pathogen was
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in seven cases. Three
blood cultures had two agents and only one had Candida
tropicalis. Nine catheters (45%) were inserted in the femoral vein,
eight (40%) in the subclavian vein and three in the jugular (15%).
Nine patients (56.3%) died within 15 days after BSI episodes.
Conclusions BSI incidence was higher in old patients and those
with a long ICU length of stay. It was lower in patients who
underwent classic hemodialysis, which is carried out by skilled
nurses from the Dialysis Program. Clinical patients’ conditions and
technical aspects of this approach influenced the data.

Introduction Data exist from centres in the United States and
Australia demonstrating that only 67–85% of the planned cycle
time of CVVH could be delivered due to unplanned interruptions.
As there is some evidence that higher CVVH doses may improve
outcome, interruptions may adversely affect the outcome of
critically ill patients with acute renal failure.
Methods We undertook an audit of CVVH in two tertiary adult
ICUs (total of 15 beds) in the United Kingdom. Patients requiring
CVVH were audited, and data on length and causes of any
interruptions were collected.
Results Over a 4-month period 34 patients received CVVH,
ranging from a total of 10 hours to 40 days. Two hundred and thirty
CVVH cycles were run, comprising 4511 hours (~75 days) of
CVVH. Only six out of 34 patients (17.6%) received CVVH without
any interruptions, seven patients had one interruption, but two
patients had at least one interruption during each cycle of their
CVVH treatment. A total 351 hours (7.7%) of CVVH time were lost
due to interruptions. The length of interruptions for individual
patients, however, varied from 0% to 34% of their total CVVH time.
The longest period of continuous CVVH lasted 17 cycles (each 24
hours), and the shortest period was 50 min until the first interrup-
tion. Table 1 presents the causes of interruptions and their duration.

Unspecified 7 (7) 20.9 5.9
Discussion This audit demonstrates that filter clotting is by far the
most common cause for interruption of CVVH and is responsible for
70.7% of lost CVVH time. Planned interruptions represent a small
minority (10%). The total time lost from CVVH was only 7.7%,
considerably less than previously reported. This may well be due to
the closed organisation of our units and increased awareness of the
important role of CVVH among staff. However, time lost from CVVH
varied widely (0–34%) and one patient illustrates the persisting
problem: repeated prescription of an erroneously low CVVH dose
of 28 ml/kg/hour (instead of 35 ml/kg/hour) and multiple unplanned
interruptions led to an average dose of only 18 ml/kg/hour,
approximately one-half of the intended dose.
Conclusion Multiple unplanned interruptions occur frequently
during CVVH treatment in intensive care and can have
considerable negative impact on the total delivered dose of CVVH.

Background Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)
with regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) has been applied to the
treatment of critically ill acute renal failure (ARF) patients for years.
It has a substantial effect on acid–base homeostasis. Accordingly,
we investigated a cohort of patients requiring CVVHDF and
assessed their acid–base changes by quantitative biophysical
principles (Stewart–Figge approach).
Methods We studied 32 consecutive critical care ARF patients on
CVVHDF with RCA. All relevant variables for acid–base analysis
were measured according to the Stewart–Figge methodology.
Results Before CVVHDF treatment, the patients had metabolic
acidosis with mild increase of the anion gap. The excess of
unmeasured anions was the most important component of
acidosis. Median lactate, phosphate and chloride levels were in the
normal range. The median albumin was 2.3 mg/dl and had an
alkalinizing effect.
On the third CVVHDF day, the median pH, bicarbonate, anion gap,
BE and SIG had significantly decreased. The median value of the
total calcium–ionic calcium ratio, a surrogate marker of citrate
accumulation, did not change significantly over treatment, and was
maintained below 2.5 mg/dl.

Conclusions In critically ill ARF patients, CVVHDF with RCA is a
safe RRT modality and it corrected metabolic acidosis through its
effects on unmeasured anions.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P283 (doi: 10.1186/cc4630)
Objective Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has
become an important supportive therapy for critically ill children
with acute renal failure. In Turkey commercially available diafiltration
and replacement fluids cannot be found on the market. Instead,
peritoneal dialysis fluids for dialysis and normal saline as
replacement fluid are used. The first objective of this study is to
examine the metabolic complications due to CRRT treatments. The
second objective is to determine demographic characteristics and
outcomes of the patients that receive CRRT.
Methods A retrospective chart review in a university hospital.
Patients All pediatric patients treated with CRRT between
February 2004 and December 2004.
Measurements and results Thirteen patients received CRRT;
seven survived (53.8%). All patients were treated with continuous
veno-venous hemodiafiltration. The median patient age was 71.8 ±
78.8 (1.5–180) months. Blood flow rates varied from 20 to 150
ml/min. Ultrafiltration and dialysis rate ranges were 90–130
ml/1.73 m2/hour and 200–1085 ml/1.73 m2/hour, respectively.
The replacement fluid dose was 17.1 ± 13.5 ml/kg/hour (5–37).
Hyperglycemia occurred in 76.9% (n = 10) and metabolic acidosis
occurred in 53.8% (n = 7) of the patients. The median age was
lower (48.8 vs 106.2 months), the median urea level (106.2 vs 71
mg/dl) and %FO (17.2% vs 7.6%) were higher, and the CRRT
initiation time was longer (8.6 vs 5.6 days) in nonsurvivors vs
survivors for all patients, although not statistically significant. CRRT
was stopped all of the survivors, and four of the nonsurvivors
(67%) were on renal replacement therapy at the time of death.
Conclusions Hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis was
frequently seen in CRRT patients when commercially available
diafiltration fluids were not available. Early initiation of CRRT
offered survival benefit to critically ill pediatric patients. The
mortality is associated with the primary disease diagnosis.

Introduction Acute renal failure in the critical care setting is a
frequent and troublesome condition that can lead to significant
morbidity and mortality. It is usually part of multiorgan failure with
an expressive burden in the ICU.
Objectives The authors present a retrospective study comparing a
hybrid renal replacement technique (HRRT) vs a continuous renal
replacement technique (CRRT) in two groups of haemodynamically
unstable patients admitted to the medical/surgical ICU.
Materials and methods One group (n = 26) received HRRT during
2003 and the other (n = 27) received CRRT during 2004, the year
of implementation of HRRT in our ICU. Severity scores (SAPS II,
APACHE II, SOFA and MODS), underlying disease and haemo-
dynamic parameters were considered. Descriptive statistical analysis
was performed by the mean and standard deviation for each
parameter. Differences between numerical variables were analysed
by Student’s t test or using the Mann–Whitney test. Multiple regres-
sion analysis was performed to evaluated differences in mortality.
Results Both groups of patients had similar severity scores,
underlying diseases and haemodynamic profile (Table 1). The urea
and creatinine reduction rates (UUR and CRR) were also
evaluated. Patients treated with HRRT showed a lower mortality
(62% vs 84%), less heparin need, and a higher URR and CRR.
Odds for mortality in the CRRT group were about three times
higher (95% CI, 0.86–12.11), but not statistically significant
(P = 0.074) (Table 2).
Conclusion HRRT is a valid alternative to CRRT in haemo-
dynamically unstable critically ill patients. Further studies are

designed dialysate solution

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P285 (doi: 10.1186/cc4632)
Background Citrate anticoagulation is an excellent alternative to
heparin anticoagulation for patients at high risk of bleeding requiring
continuous renal replacement therapy. However, citrate anticoagula-
tion has some potential adverse effects such as metabolic alkalosis
and acidosis, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia. Thus,
most citrate anticoagulation protocols use specially designed dialysis
fluids to compensate for most of these disarrangements. We present
a newly designed dialysate for citrate anticoagulation and looked at
the filter life time, acid–base and electrolyte disarrangements.
Methods Based on theoretical considerations we composed a
dialysis fluid suitable for a 2 l/hour dialysis flow rate. The dialysate
contained 133 mmol/l sodium, 2 mmol/l potassium, 1.1 mmol/l
magnesium, 20 mmol/l bicarbonate and 112.2 mmol/l chloride. All
treatments were performed as CVVHD. Routine filter changes
were performed after 72 hours of treatment.
Results Forty-five patients were included in the study. Treatments
were well tolerated. The filter life was appropriate (57.4 ± 17 hours).
In a few patients mild metabolic alkalosis (pH > 7.45 plus BE > +3)
was easily counteracted by increasing the dialysis fluid flow. Acid–
base values returned to normal within 24 hours after increasing the
dialysate flow. The maximum dialysate flow was 3000 ml/hour.
Hypernatremia and hypocalcemia were not observed. The systemic
ionized calcium concentration was successfully controlled by
adjustments of a continuous calcium infusion made with respect to
the results of 6 hourly measurements.
Conclusion The analyzed citrate anticoagulation protocol was well
tolerated and the filter life time was appropriate. Regional
anticoagulation with trisodium citrate in combination with a
customized calcium-free dialysate is a safe and effective alternative
to a heparin-based anticoagulation regimen.

Surgical operations, chemotherapy or/and radiotherapy often
cause critical forms of organ failure in cancer patients. Mortality in
multiorgan failure cancer patients inducted by sepsis is about
97–100%. High-dose haemofiltration (CHDHF) or haemodia-
filtration (CHDHDF) early application in sepsis treatment promotes
the organ failure recovery and reduces lethality in cancer patients.
One hundred and fifty-six patients (APACHE II = 32.3 ± 3.6) with
multiorgan failure were studied in the Cancer Research Center in
Moscow. All patients received CHDHF or CHDHDF as well as
standard intensive care. Seventy-six of these patients suffered from
acute sepsis. The expected and real mortality were compared
within the groups of patients with and without sepsis. The cytokine
and medium molecular substances concentrations were measured
in the blood, urine and in the filtrate.
CHDHF and CHDHDF were performed with Fresenius and Edwards
equipment with the substrate flow up to 10000 ml/hour in the 42%
predilution and 58% postdilution mode. The treatment duration
varied from 2 to 25 days. The average substitution volume in all
patients was 4–9 l/hour. The filtration fraction equal to 33% of
blood flow can be safely reached at Hct = 20–25%. The
membrane was replaced every 36 hours in spite of the absence of
polyestersulphone membrane thrombosis. MALDI analysis and
electrophoresis were used for protein detection in filtrate. It was
found that during CHDHDF the proteins with molecular weight up
to 77 kDa are eliminated. This fraction contains 29–31% of
albumin and 11–17% of transferrin. The excess of associated
proinflammatory cytokines are also eliminated with high efficiency.
The C3 component of complement system, leukotriene B4, and
thromboxane are not eliminated.
CHDHF and CHDHDF were hemodynamically tolerant in all
patients. In nonseptic patients (n = 74) with MOF the mortality was
52%, which is statistically significant in retrospective comparison
with patients without HDF (P < 0.01). In septic patients with MOF
the mortality was 82% (P < 0.01 in retrospective comparison with
patients without HDF). The application of CHDHF and CHDHDF
immediately after the diagnosis ‘septic shock’ was made (n = 16)
permitted one to stop the shock development within 8–20 hours in
all patients. The organ failure recovery in CHDHF and CHDHDF
patients varied from 7 to 93 days. The further quality of life was
determined by the treatment efficiency and by the recovery degree
of organ function.
In conclusion, CHDHF and CHDHDF are safe and efficient in early
application in cancer patients with MOF intensive care. Vitally
important proteins losses must be calculated and compensated.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P287 (doi: 10.1186/cc4634)
Introduction Superantigens are suspected of being potent
initiators of Gram-positive sepsis, and new therapies for super-
antigen elimination are required. The effects of hemoadsorption
with a superantigen-adsorbing device (SAAD) should be evaluated
in septic swine. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy
of SAAD by sequential monitoring of physiological and serological
parameters.
Methods Twelve landrace male pigs (25–38 kg) were
mechanically ventilated and anesthetized with isofluorane. A
Swan–Ganz catheter was inserted into the right jugular vein and
the right carotid artery was used for the monitoring of blood
pressure. The anti-toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (anti-TSST-1) IgG
antibody and anti-TSST-1 IgM antibody were under detection the

under the detection level (<5 pg/ml). TSST-1 was infused at
2 µg/kg/hour, and the blood concentration was maintained at the
clinical level for 6 hours, LPS (10 µg/kg/hours) was then infused to
induce lethal shock. Heparin (200 U/kg/hour) was used as the
anticoagulant. All animals were hemoperfused with SAAD or a
control column for 8 hours and changes in pathological parameters
and mortality were examined.
Results Animals perfused with SAAD had a highly significant
(P < 0.01) survival advantage compared with control groups at
24 hours after initiation of TSST-1 infusion. SAAD also suppressed
the increase in the arterio-venous shunt ratio and decrease of partial
arterial oxygen pressure at 6 hours after TSST-1 infusion initiation.
Conclusion We suggest that there is a potential application of SAAD
in treating superantigen-induced respiratory dysfunction and sepsis.

Immunoadsorption of lipopolysaccharides, IL-6 and
complement-activation product 5a in severe sepsis and
septic shock

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P288 (doi: 10.1186/cc4635)
Background In severe sepsis and septic shock, endotoxin
(lipopolysaccharides [LPS]), IL-6 and complement-activation
product 5a (C5a) trigger inflammatory cascades resulting in
multiple organ dysfunction and failure of the cell-mediated immune
system (immunoparalysis). This correlates with uncontrolled
infection and fatal outcome. We therefore determined whether
simultaneous removal of systemic LPS, IL-6 and C5a by selective
immunoadsorption (IA) reduces hyperinflammation, reverses
immunoparalysis and improves organ functions in patients with
severe sepsis and septic shock.
Design In a prospective, controlled, open-label fashion, 29
patients with severe sepsis or septic shock hospitalized in the
ICUs of a university hospital were included in a proof-of-concept
trial (ISASS-1). Patients were enrolled between 2002 and 2004
and followed-up for 28 days, until hospital discharge or death.
Methods In addition to the best supportive ICU care, 11 patients
(age 57.8 ± 2.2 years, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II [APACHE-II] score 23.7 ± 1.6) received extra-
corporeal LPS-IA, IL-6-IA and C5a-IA on 5 consecutive days for
7.5 hours each. As control, prognostically relevant parameters of
18 contemporary patients (age 55.2 ± 2.6, APACHE II score
22.9 ± 1.2) were followed up.
Results There was no difference between the study groups at
baseline. Target molecules were reduced under IA: IL-6
(361.7 ± 116.0 to 38.2 ± 15.2 pg/ml, P = 0.003), C5a (297.6 ± 43.1
to 79.2 ± 14.5 ng/ml, P < 0.001) and markers of endotoxemia. In
IA-treated individuals, IL-6 (P < 0.001), CRP (P = 0.001) and
APACHE II score (P = 0.002) was significantly lower at day 7.
Monocytic HLA-DR improved in IA patients (P < 0.001) and was
unchanged in controls. HLA-DR recovered in all immunoparalytic
patients under IA (4993.6 ± 1162 to 15,295.3 ± 2197 molecules/
cell, P = 0.002).
Conclusions Immunoadsorption is a new, selective approach to
target key inflammatory mediators in septic patients. Simultaneous
targeting of LPS, IL-6 and C5a reduced major inflammatory
mediators, reversed immunoparalysis and improved major disease
severity scores.

Objective A favorable prognosis has been reported for critically ill
patients when the gastric mucosal pH (pHi) is improved at an early
stage even if the pHi is low, but reports about the pHi in patients
with sepsis are limited. We therefore studied the value of the pHi
of sepsis patients whose global oxygen metabolism has been
stabilized. In addition, we studied whether it would be able to
improve the pHi of sepsis patients by using the direct hemo-
perfusion with an immobilized polymyxin B fiber column
(DHP-PMX).
Materials and methods Before the start of DHP-PMX, the global
oxygen metabolism and tissue oxygen metabolism were measured.
A thermodilution catheter was used to determine the oxygen
delivery index (DO2I), oxygen consumption index (VO2I), and
oxygen extraction ratio (O2ER) as parameters of global oxygen
metabolism. A thermodilution catheter was also used to monitor
hemodynamics and the fluid balance was managed to maintain the
central venous pressure in the range of 7–10 mmHg. A gastric
tonometer was used for measurement of pHi. Thirty-two patients
with sepsis satisfying the following criteria were enrolled in the
study: signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to
infection; mean arterial blood pressure >60 mmHg (irrespective of
the use of catecholamines); and stable global oxygen metabolism
(DO2I > 500 ml/min/m2 and VO2I > 120 ml/min/m2). DHP-PMX
was performed twice within 24 hours (for 3 hours each time). The
pHi and arterial blood gases were measured four times (before
DHP-PMX as well as 24, 48, and 72 hours afterward). The
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was
calculated before DHP-PMX. The APACHE II score was also
calculated to assess the severity of each patient’s condition before
DHP-PMX.
Results Twenty-six patients survived and were discharged from
hospital, whereas the other six patients died. The cause of death
was hepatic failure in two patients and cardiac failure in four
patients. Forty-five bacterial strains were detected in 32 subjects
and the most commonly isolated microorganisms were Gram-
negative bacteria. DHP-PMX was performed in patients with Gram-
negative or mixed Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections.
Antibiotic therapy was judged to be adequate when the patient
received antibiotics to which each isolated microorganism was
sensitive. Although it was not possible to identify bacteria in four
patients, cultures were positive in 28 patients and adequate
antibiotic treatment was given to them. The SOFA score was 9.1 ±
1.0 and the APACHE II score was 20 ± 1.0 before DHP-PMX. All
of the patients were on mechanical ventilation. The pHi was 7.22 ±
0.04 immediately before the start of DHP-PMX, 7.28 ± 0.03 (P =
0.036) at 24 hours afterward, 7.32 ± 0.03 (P = 0.006) at 48 hours
afterward, and 7.34 ± 0.02 (P = 0.0034) at 72 hours afterward,
showing a significant increase from 24 hours onward compared
with the pretreatment value.
Conclusion These findings suggest that DHP-PMX improves the
pHi. This was a prospective uncontrolled observational study
including a limited number of patients. The results of larger, better
powered, multicenter clinical trails are necessary if we are to
assess accurately the benefit of DHP-PMX.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P290 (doi: 10.1186/cc4637)
Introduction Hemoperfusion with a column of polymixin B
immobilized on fibers (PMX) increases the blood pressure too
rapidly for the effect to be attributable to endotoxin removal. On the
other hand, continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)
also has effects of increasing blood pressure in septic patients.
Since inducible NO synthase (iNOS) is known to be involved in the
profound hypotension, we hypothesized that a decrease of tetra-
hydrobiopterine (BH4), an essential cofactor of iNOS, might
account for the rapid effect of PMX and CVVHDF on blood
pressure, if PMX and CVVHDF can decrease BH4. In this study we
therefore measured the plasma level of BH4 and NO metabolites
(NOx) in septic patients, and evaluated whether PMX and
CVVHDF can decrease them.
Methods With institutional approval and informed consent, we
studied 14 septic patients (aged 67.1 ± 13.2 years). Fourteen
healthy volunteers (aged 38.4 ± 10.3 years) served as controls for
BH4 and NOx. Plasma BH4 was quantified by HPLC with
fluorimetric detection.
Analysis All results are expressed as the mean ± SD, with
statistical evaluation by a paired t test and unpaired t test and
repeated-measures one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s PLSD
for multicomparisons.
Results The plasma level of BH4 in septic patients was indeed
markedly elevated compared with that in volunteers (140.0 ± 148.1
vs 24.1 ± 4.8 pmol/ml, P < 0.01). Level of NOx was 140.3 ± 70 vs
28.7 ± 11.6 nmol/ml, P < 0.01). Comparison of BH4 and NOx
concentrations at inflow and outflow of the PMX column or
CVVHDF dialyzer confirmed significantly low values at the outflow.
Discussion and conclusion Several lines of experimental and
clinical evidence indicate that hyperproduction of NO by iNOS
contributes to the hypotension, cardiac depression and vascular
hyporeactivity. However, the efficacy of NOS inhibitor in patients
with septic shock failed to find any beneficial effect in terms of the
incidence of noncardiovascular organ dysfunction. A possible
explanation for these puzzling results may be the use of a
nonspecific NOS inhibitor, which blocks both endothelial NO
synthase (eNOS) and iNOS, since eNOS is necessary to inhibit
adhesion of platelets and leukocytes to the endothelium and plays
a protective role against inflammation. We hypothesized that
removal of BH4 might decrease iNOS activity without greatly
affecting the activity of eNOS, since eNOS has access to tissue
stores of BH4, but NO generation from iNOS is critically
dependent on BH4 availability. The marked increase in BH4
concomitantly with NOx in septic shock patients and its reduction
by PMX or CVVHDF are consistent with our hypothesis, and
appear to justify further research on BH4 removal as a potential
therapeutic target. In conclusion, BH4 plays the greater role in
inducing excessive vasodilatation in septic shock, and PMX or
CVVHDF can decrease BH4 and NOx.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P291 (doi: 10.1186/cc4638)
Introduction Septic shock remains a major cause of multiple organ
failure with a high mortality rate. A relationship between high-
mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB-1) and septic shock was
recently reported. On the other hand, treatment of direct
hemoperfusion with polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column (PMX;
Toray Industries Inc., Tokyo Japan) was developed in Japan in
1994 and has been used for treatment of septic shock of
endotoxemia. Reduction of the serum endotoxin level by PMX has
been recognized. Clinical effectiveness data of this column have
also been reported, for example increasing the systolic blood
pressure and improvement of the systemic vascular resistance
index. Although a decrease of inflammatory cytokine after direct
hemoperfusion with PMX has been reported, the detailed
mechanism of PMX is not known.
Patients and methods We treated 10 septic shock cases by
direct hemoperfusion with PMX. All patients were diagnosed with
sepsis according to the criteria of the American College of Chest
Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus
Conference and required intensive care for unstable circulation
state. We measured the HMGB-1 level at three points; before
direct hemoperfusion with PMX, after direct hemoperfusion with
PMX and 12 hours afterward. We also examined clinical data;
systolic blood pressure and Sepsis-related Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) score.
Results There were five peritonitis cases and five severe
pneumonia cases. Five cases admitted the decrease of the
HMGB-1 value immediately before and after direct hemoperfusion
with PMX implementation. Especially in five peritonitis cases, the
HMGB-1 value at 12 hours compared with that before direct
hemoperfusion with PMX implementation had decreased in all
cases. Increasing systolic blood pressure was confirmed in three
cases and a decrease of HMGB-1 was admitted in five cases.
Before and after direct hemoperfusion with PMX, there was
significant correlation (P = 0.0384) of systolic blood pressure
reaction and HMGB-1 decrease.
Discussion The possibility of the adsorption of HMGB-1 by direct
hemoperfusion with PMX has been shown. Also, the possibility that
the adsorption of HMGB-1 was the factor of the morbid state
improvement by direct hemoperfusion with PMX was suggested.

the survival of paediatric patients on ECMO with multiorgan

dysfunction in the setting of sepsis is very low, with a reported
mortality of 100%. We report a series of five paediatric patients
with sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction who were managed by extra-
corporeal albumin dialysis (EAD) during their course on ECMO.
Patients and methods All paediatric patients with sepsis-induced
multiorgan dysfunction who were treated in our unit with ECMO
and EAD were included. Patients who were treated with EAD
mainly for high bilirubin in the absence of evidence of severe
sepsis were excluded. All patients fulfilled the criteria for severe
sepsis as suggested by the ACCP/SCCM Consensus Conference
Committee. EAD was performed using a molecular adsorbent re-
circulating system (Gambro AB, Stockholm, Sweden).
Results The age of the patients ranged between 1 month and
17 years. The primary diagnosis was pneumonia in four patients
(bacterial in three patients and viral in one patient) and meningo-
coccal septicaemia in one patient. All patients had positive
bacterial cultures and two patients also had positive viral serology
at the time of admission for ECMO. All patients had cardiac and
respiratory dysfunction at the time of admission for ECMO. In
addition two patients had renal dysfunction and one patient each
had hepatic and haematological dysfunction at the time of
admission for ECMO. All these patients deteriorated subsequently
and EAD was used as rescue therapy. At the time of institution of
EAD four patients had dysfunction of four organs (respiratory,
cardiac, renal and liver) and one patient had dysfunction of five
organs (respiratory, cardiac, renal, liver and haematological
dysfunction). All patients received between one and three EAD
treatments. Two out of the five patients (40%) survived to hospital
discharge. All these patients would have been expected to die
according to our previous experience as well as the published
results in such a group of patients.
Conclusion EAD may prove to be an effective treatment in
paediatric patients with sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction.
Further research is required to identify the group of patients who
would benefit most from the use of EAD in the setting of sepsis-
induced multiorgan dysfunction.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P293 (doi: 10.1186/cc4640)
Introduction In critically unstable patients, conventional dialysis is
difficult to perform and continuous methods have been the treatment
of choice. The use of mixed dialytic techniques such as slow low-
efficient daily dialysis (SLEDD) offers the combined advantages of
conventional haemodialysis and continuous dialytic techniques.
Objectives To compare the costs/efficacy/efficiency as well as
nurse care between SLEDD and continuous techniques (CVVHDF).
Materials and methods A retrospective and comparative study was
performed considering both methods from 1 October 2003 to 31
March 2004. The study evaluated the following parameters: number of
patients enrolled, age, gender, number of procedures, APACHE II
score, SAPS II score, heparin consumption, volume extracted, duration
of procedures, blood pumping speed, BUN clearance and costs.
Results The authors compared SLEDD with 24-hour CVVHDF.
The urea clarification rate with SLEDD was 48.3% compared with
37% with CVVHDF; creatinine clearance in SLEDD was 43%
compared with 31.7% with CVVHDF; economic advantages were
also compared per technique (€37.50 vs €235 in SLEDD and
CVVHDF, respectively). Heparin used in SLEDD was 4400 IU
compared with 12,000 in CVVHDF.
Conclusion SLEDD was more efficient in removing urea and
creatinine and was well tolerated in haemodynamically unstable
patients. Each SLEDD session was six times less expensive than
each 24-hour session of CVVHDF. SLEDD also permitted access
to daily dialysis in more patients, a lower nurse workload and better
time management in patient care.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P294 (doi: 10.1186/cc4641)
Introduction Patients with chronic kidney disease have decreased
immunity and increased risk for infection. We evaluated the
occurrence rate of infection in ICU patients with acute kidney
injury, and its impact on hospital mortality.
Methods Retrospective evaluation of all ICU patients with acute
kidney injury treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT) during a
5-year period (2000–2004) in the 22-bed SICU, eight-bed
CSICU, and six-bed Burn Unit of a Belgian tertiary care hospital.
Infection was scored based on chart review, and the pharmacy
database on antibiotic prescription.
Results During the study period 406 patients were included. The
median (IQR) age was 64 (53–73) years, 68% of patients were
male, and the APACHE II score was 24 (17–30). At the start of
renal replacement therapy, 69% of patients were treated with vaso-
active therapy, and 73% were ventilated. Infection occurred in
87% of patients; 38% had more than one infection. The start of
infection was during the treatment period with RRT in 41.4% of all
infections, and in 58.6% before or after the treatment period with
RRT. The incidence rate of infection was 5.92 per 100 patient-
days. Patients who developed infection had a longer length of stay
in the ICU (7 [15–31] days vs 5 [3–7] days; P < 0.001). There
was no difference in mortality between patients with and without
infection (62.5% respectively 54.9%, P = 0.295). Infection was
not associated with inhospital mortality, even after adjustment for
age, type of ICU admitted to, APACHE II score, and severity of
illness at start of RRT (i.e. treatment with vasoactive therapy) or
mechanical ventilation (odds ratio for inhospital death: 0.52
[0.21–1.28], P = 0.152) (logistic regression analysis).
Conclusions In this cohort of ICU patients with acute kidney injury
and treated with RRT, infection had a high occurrence rate of
almost 90%. Also, more than one-third of these patients had more
than one infection episode. Infection was not associated with
increased inhospital mortality.

Objective To examine 90-day and 5-year mortality of critically ill
patients with ARF, requiring RRT, compared with critically ill
patients without ARF, requiring RRT.
Design A population-based cohort study.
Methods Aarhus University Intensive Care Study Cohort enabled
us to identify all patients, aged 15 years or more, with first-time
admission to three multidisciplinary ICUs within Aarhus University
Hospital from 1999 to 2003. We obtained information on the
presence of ARF requiring RRT through the study cohort.
Complete follow-up on mortality was obtained from the Danish
Civil Registration System. We constructed Kaplan–Meier survival
curves, based on the date of ICU admission, for the main study
variables (RRT: yes/no and age groups: 15–59, 60+ years) and
computed contingency tables for 90-day and 5-year mortality. We
computed 90-day mortality rate ratios (MRR) and 5-year MRR for
patients surviving 90 days, stratified on age group.
Results We identified 16,038 patients with a first-time ICU
admission; 685 (4.3%) of those had ARF requiring RRT. The
median age was 66.2 years (range 17.7–89.7) among patients
with ARF requiring RRT, and 63.8 years (range 15.1–101.7)
among those without ARF. Ninety-day and 5-year mortality among
patients with ARF requiring RRT, aged 60+ years, was 60% and
79%, compared with 39% and 53% among those younger than
60 years (see Fig. 1). The 90-day MRR for patients with ARF requiring
RRT aged 15–59 and 60+ years was 6.8 (95% CI: 5.5–8.5) and
6.2 (95% CI: 5.4–7.1) when compared with patients without ARF
requiring RRT. In comparison, the corresponding 5-year MRR for
patients surviving the first 90 days after ICU admission was 1.3
(95% CI: 0.8–2.0) and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.2–2.1), respectively.
Conclusion ARF requiring RRT in critically ill patients is associated
with a substantial increase in medium-term mortality, most markedly
among elderly patients. However, among critically ill patients with
ARF requiring RRT who survive the first 90 days after ICU
admission, the 5-year mortality seems to be only slightly increased.

Background Despite improvement of therapy, mortality remains
constant for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) treated with
renal replacement therapy (RRT). The aim was to evaluate the
mortality of AKI-RRT patients over a 10-year period.
Methods A retrospective study on all ICU patients with AKI-RRT in
a tertiary-care ICU. Data are presented as the number (interquartile
range) or proportion.
Results Over a 10-year period, 1330 ICU patients had AKI-RRT.
Results per year are presented in Table 1. Outcome improved
(hazard ratio [HR] [/year] = 0.95 [0.93–0.98], P < 0.001). This
trend to improved outcome remained, even after adjustment for
age, APACHE II score, vasopressor use or mechanical ventilation
at the start of RRT: HR (/year) = 0. 96 [0.94–0.99], P = 0.002).

Introduction Acute renal dysfunction/failure (ARF) is newly
considered as an independent mortality risk factor in the ICU [1].
The time of onset of ARF could have a prognostic impact.
Objective To determine prognosis of acquired vs not acquired
renal dysfunction.
Methods Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data as
part of the APRiMo study [2]. We defined ARF as serum creatinine
level >100 µmol/l. We defined the early ARF group (E) as renal
dysfunction that occurred during maternity management (less than
24 hours before transfer to the ICU) or at day 1 of ICU admission.
The late ARF group (L) was defined as renal dysfunction occurring
from day 2 of ICU admission. Inclusion criteria: critically ill obstetric
patients presenting with one or more of the presenting conditions:
severe pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage, stroke,
HELLP syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome, and so on.
Exclusion criteria: length of stay in the ICU <2 calendar days,
chronic renal failure. Setting: patients first managed in a tertiary
referral maternity for high-risk pregnancies, then transferred to our
independent multidisciplinary ICU. Collected data: demographic,
obstetric management, daily SOFA score. Main outcome of
interest: vital status at ICU discharge. Adequate statistical tests
were used (t test, chi-square test, etc.). P < 0.05 was considered
significant.

Results Six hundred and forty patients, overall mortality 13.3%,
included n = 223: 193 in group E and 30 in group L. There was no
difference in demographic data, main admission diagnosis
between E and L groups. Mean maximum creatinine level: group E
= 270 µmol/l, group L = 220 µmol/l (P = 0.15). Renal replacement
therapy: 30/193 and 7/30 (P = 0.3). Comparing group L vs group
E: L had a higher mortality rate (73% vs 20.7%; P < 0.001),
duration of mechanical ventilation (5.8 ± 1 vs 3.5 ± 0,26;
P = 0,001), rate of massive transfusion in the ICU (13/30 vs
34/193; P = 0.003) and length of stay (8.9 vs 6.2, P = 0.03).
Mean day 1 MOD score summing organ dysfunctions without renal
dysfunction: 7.6 ± 3.3 vs 5.5 ± 4 (P = 0.45). Mean total maximum
MOD score (TM_MODS):11 ± 6 vs 6 ± 5, P = 0.001. For group E,
nonsurvivors (NS) showed significantly more unstable haemo-
dynamic state with a lower diastolic arterial pressure (P = 0.007),
uterine atonia (P = 0.001), transfusion rate in the labor ward/
operating room and ICU stay than survivors (S). For group L, NS vs
S: mean MODS at day 1 ICU admission 8.1 ± 3.7 vs 6.2 ± 2.7,
P = 0.15), mean TM_MODS (16.2 ± 3.3 vs 7.8 ± 3.1, P < 0.001).
NS were paradoxically younger than the S (29 years vs 35 years,
P < 0.01). Duration of mechanical ventilation was higher among
NS (P = 0.001). The main diagnosis of admission was postpartum
hemorrhage complicating HELLP syndrome or sepsis. Three organ
failures lasting >2 days (renal failure not counted) is associated
with 100% mortality (n = 17).
Conclusion Acquired ARF is an important prognostic factor. It is
more serious than early ARF for the same level of serum creatinine.

Background Passive leg raising (PLR) can be used effectively to
treat hypotension associated with hypovolemia by autotransfusion.
We investigated the microvascular response to autotransfusion by
PLR before and after ultrafiltration in patients on hemodialysis.
Patients and methods Patients who were on chronic intermittent
hemodialysis were assessed for sublingual microvascular flow by
sidestream darkfield (SDF) imaging before and 1 min after PLR
(45° upward) before and after ultrafiltration (UF). Sublingual
capillary flow was estimated using a semiquantitative microvascular
flow index (MFI) in small (diameter 10–25 µm), medium (25–50 µm),
and large-sized (50–100 µm) microvessels (0 = no flow; 1 = sludging
[0–0.5 mm/s], 2 = moderate flow [0.5–1.0 mm/s], 3 = high flow
[1.0–3.0 mm/s]). Changes were evaluated with nonparametric
paired Wilcoxon test. Associations were determined with the sign
test. P < 0.05 was judged to indicate a significant difference.
Results Sixteen patients took part in the study. The underlying
disease causing renal insufficiency was predominantly hyper-
tension (HT, n = 6) and diabetes mellitus (n = 6). At the start of
ultrafiltration, PLR did not alter the microvascular flow (P = NS).
After UF (median volume extraction 2.8 l) the capillary MFI
increased in most patients after PLR (P < 0.01), whereas flow was
not affected in large-sized microvessels (P = NS). The change in
capillary MFI before and after UF was related to the UF volume in
HT patients (P = 0.01), but not in the other patients.
Conclusion Autotransfusion by PLR improves sublingual capillary
microvascular perfusion in hypovolemia after UF. SDF imaging and
PLR may be a useful bedside tool to evaluate the patient’s volume
status. In this small dataset, the finding that derangement of
microvascular perfusion after UF occurs predominantly in HT
patients merits further studies.

Objective To determine ICU awareness regarding measurement of
intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), features of intra-abdominal hypertension
(IAH), and management of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).
Methods The survey explored experience, measurement methods
and understanding of IAP, causes of IAH and management of ACS.
Results Ninety-two percent of the ICU Registrars used IAP but
52% only infrequently. While 90% understood that IAP can cause
rises in intraperitoneal pathology, retroperitoneal causation of IAH
was poorly understood. Ninety-two percent correctly said that ACS
should be treated by abdominal decompression. Only 70% of our
respondents would not perform CT of the abdomen
predecompression. Thirty-three percent erroneously said that they
would treat IAP >30 mmHg regardless of organ dysfunction and
another 22% were unsure of the threshold of therapy for ACS.

intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal massive bleeding, we often
cannot close the abdominal wound and have to adopt a strategy
called open abdomen because of intestinal and retroperitoneal
bulky edema. Exudate and blood in these cases is too massive to
be completely absorbed by dressing gauze. Spilled exudate and
blood from an abdominal open wound and dressing gauze easily
causes contamination to the environment. We can prevent
contamination by the exudate and bleeding with the ‘seal and
continuous high pressure aspiration method (S-CHPA)’. The aim of
this study is to clarify the usefulness of SCHPA.
Patients and methods The procedure of S-CHPA was as follows;
a sump tube wrapped in gauze was inserted in the abdominal open
wound apart from the wound, and the wound was sealed by a
surgical drape. We examined the spread of contamination of
exudate and blood from the abdominal wound, the volume of
exudate and blood from the abdominal wound, the frequency of
dressing change, and complications due to S-CHPA or the open
abdomen in seven patients with ACS.
Results Concerning the spread of contamination of exudate and
blood from the abdominal wound, there was no contamination to
the environment because of complete aspiration with a completely
sealed negative-pressure system, and aspirated exudate and blood
in the disposable bag was wasted as a closed system without
spreading contamination. No exudate and blood spilled over
beyond the sealed drape and closed system. Exudate and blood
was completely aspirated into the disposable bag, whose weight
was able to be accurately and easily measured
(247 ± 269 g/hour). On the contrary, the volume of exudate and
blood soaked into the gauze dressing the wound and the drain was
only 6 ± 16 g/day.
The frequency of dressing change except for the daily routine one
was 0 per day in this procedure. There are no complications
concerning S-CHPA and infectious complications due to foreign
bodies such as plastic infusion bag or massive sponge reaft in the
peritoneal cavity.
Conclusion S-CHPA is a useful procedure for open abdomen
patients to prevent contamination to the environment. This
procedure is also useful for exact measuring of fluid loss and blood
loss, exact evaluation of the total water balance, and the saving
cost of dressing sponges and costs of labor for dressing changes.

Abdominal compartment syndrome following rectus
sheath hematoma: bladder-to-gastric pressure difference
as a guide to treatment

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P301 (doi: 10.1186/cc4648)
Introduction Rectus sheath hematoma (RSH) is a well-recognised
complication of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). In the past,
surgeons were reluctant to operate on RSH. Increased intra-
abdominal pressure (IAP) and abdominal compartment syndrome
(ACS) have been reported in association with RSH. IAP is usually
measured via the bladder (IBP) but can be increased compared
with gastric pressure (IGP). We report two cases of ACS caused
by LMWH-induced RSH where simultaneous IBP-IGP was
recorded. We hypothesized that a high bladder-to-gastric-pressure
difference was a marker of localised ACS, whereas a low bladder-
to-gastric-pressure difference was a marker of systemic ACS.
Methods IGP was measured with the Spiegelberg IAP catheter
(Spiegelberg, Hamburg, Germany) and IBP with the
FoleyManometer (Holtech Medical, Copenhagen, Denmark).
Patients First case An 81-year-old woman was admitted with
LMWH-induced RSH-related cardiorespiratory failure. The SAPS II
score was 61, APACHE II score 28, and SOFA score 12. The IBP
rose from 2 mmHg on day 1 to 40 mmHg on day 3 and IGP from
19 to 38, respectively; this together with organ failure lead to the
diagnosis of ACS. The mean bladder-to-gastric-pressure
difference was 1.1. She was intubated and ventilated, on high FiO2
and vasopressors. On day 3 she deteriorated dramatically and a
surgical ‘rescue’ evacuation of the hematoma (3 l) was performed.
This resulted in a drop of IBP to 18 mmHg postoperative and
11 mmHg over the following days. She regained spontaneous
diuresis a couple of hours after decompression, vasopressors were
stopped the next day and she was weaned from the ventilator the
day after. She was discharged on day 10.
Second case A 77-year-old man was admitted following respiratory
distress, lactic acidosis and (pre)renal insufficiency related to
LMWH-induced RSH. The SAPS II score was 49, APACHE II score
25, and SOFA score 4. The IBP was 24 mmHg on day 1 while the
IGP was only 5.5 mmHg. He was intubated later that day. The high
IBP together with cardiorespiratory failure lead to the diagnosis of
localised ACS (normal IGP). The mean bladder-to-gastric-pressure
difference was 6.1. He was treated conservatively with sedation +
curarisation, resulting in normalisation of IBP. On day 14 he was
extubated and regained diuresis. He was discharged on day 24.
Conclusion IBP can be increased by RSH. This does not always
imply ACS, even in the presence of organ failure. We suggest
using the bladder-to-gastric-pressure difference to differentiate
between a localised or systemic ACS. Only the latter should be
treated with decompressive surgery.

Introduction Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is an important
outcome-predictor in critically ill patients [1,2]. Abdominal perfusion
pressure (APP = MAP – IAP) is suggested as a better resuscitation
endpoint [3]. Until now no prospective data have been available
looking at the effect of IAP and APP on outcome in patients with
acute respiratory failure (ARF) that are mechanically ventilated (MV).
Methods Over a 12-month period patients admitted with ARF were
studied prospectively. Patients were screened for IAH (defined as
IAP >12 mmHg) with the FoleyManometer method (Holtech,
Kopenhagen, Denmark). The IAP was recorded four to six times daily
together with the highest and lowest APP, fluid balance, and SOFA
score. Until now data have been collected on 142 patients (127
medical and 15 surgical). The major endpoint was ICU mortality.
Values are the mean ± SD. The unpaired Student t test was used.
Results BMI was 25.1 ± 5.2, male/female ratio 1/1, age 63.9 ±
16.3 years, APACHE II score 23.8 ± 10.2, SAPS-II 52.3 ± 17.3.
The SOFA score on day 1 was 9.4 ± 3.6 with 2 ± 1 organ failures.
IAP on day 1 was 10.4 ± 3.9 mmHg, while APP was 58.2 ± 15.5.
Intra-abdominal hypertension was present in 33.1%. Mortality was
52.9%. The outcome did not differ between patients with or without
IAH. Nonsurvivors had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher IAP by day
4, but the APP was already significantly lower (<55 mmHg) from
day 1 onwards. There was a more positive daily and cumulative net
fluid balance in nonsurvivors and the extravascular lung water was
also significantly higher on admission in the nonsurvivors.

S126
Conclusion The preliminary results of an ongoing prospective trial,
and the first looking at APP in ARF, show that the incidence of IAH is
high in ARF. Mortality is also high but in correlation with the severity
scores. The persistence of IAH by day 4 was able to discriminate
between survivors and nonsurvivors. However, the presence of a low
APP (<55 mmHg) was already able to discriminate between
survivors and nonsurvivors from day 1 onwards. Close monitoring of
IAP and especially APP seems warranted in patients with ARF.

Influence of intra-abdominal hypertension on renal artery
and vein flow in the porcine kidney

UZ Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P303 (doi: 10.1186/cc4650)
Background In man, intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) has been
shown to impair renal perfusion due to decreased renal artery flow
(RAF). Renal venous hypertension and decreased renal venous
flow (RVF) are other potential contributing mechanisms. We used
a porcine model of IAH to evaluate the role of RVF and renal
venous pressure (RVP) in renal dysfunction due to IAH.
Methods We studied nine anesthetized and ventilated pigs in the
prone position (46 ± 3 kg) after insertion of a renal vein catheter
and after placement of flow probes around the renal artery and
vein. Following baseline measurements, RAF, RVF and RVP were
measured during incremental intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) levels
(10, 20 and 30 mmHg during 45 min each) by infusing warmed
saline into the peritoneal cavity. Standard hemodynamic parameters,
obtained from Swan–Ganz monitoring, were also recorded.
Results RAF and RVF decreased in parallel at an IAP of 20 and
30 mmHg (Table 1) without dropping to zero flow. RVP paralleled
the increase in IAP, but always exceeded IAP by 3–4 mmHg. Renal
perfusion pressure (RPP = MAP – RVP) decreased significantly
with increasing IAP, in spite of significantly increased MAPs. RAF/
CO decreased from 44% to 34%, indicating a flow redistribution
away from the kidney in IAH. In parallel, renal vascular resistance
(RVR = RPP / RAF) increased from 0.75 to 1.1 mmHg.min/ml with
increasing IAP (Table 1).

Conclusion Decreased renal perfusion in IAH is not only due to
decreased RAF, but also due to a regional effect of redistribution
away from the kidney. Renal venous hypertension can account for
this observation.

Introduction Septic patients may develop intra-abdominal hyper-
tension (IAH) with decreased SMA flow and gut ischemia. The
effect of aggressive resuscitation on IAH and gut dysfunction in
sepsis has not been well studied.
Hypothesis Aggressive resuscitation in sepsis prevents gut
ischemia despite IAH.
Methods Seven pigs were used for intervention and three pigs
served as controls. All pigs were sedated and ventilated, and
arterial, PA and SMV catheters were inserted. SMA flow was
measured with an intra-abdominal transonic flowmeter and IAP
was measured directly. Intervention animals received 80 µg E. coli
0127:B8 LPS i.v. over 1 hour. Blood samples were taken and
hemodynamics measured before and hourly after LPS. Saline and
norepinephrine were used for resuscitation (target MAP > 65 mmHg,
urine > 0.5 ml/kg/hour, mixed venous SO2 > 70%). SO2 was
maintained >85%. ANOVA analysis was used for result evaluation.
Results After i.v. LPS administration, the animals developed shock
and three succumbed after 6 hours. The MAP, CO, DO2 and VO2
were stable until animals were moribund. We saw a positive
correlation between infused volume and IAP. The IAP exceeded
30 mmHg by 6 hours. However, the abdominal perfusion pressure,

SMA flow and SMV lactate were unchanged as long as CO and CI
were stable. CO and CI correlated inversely with SMV lactate. No
changes in the IAP were observed in the control animals.
Conclusions Significant IAH develops in a model of LPS sepsis.
However, gut ischemia is prevented by adequate CO and intestinal
DO2.

Does intravesical pressure as an estimation of intra-
abdominal pressure predict effects on portal circulation?

Introduction In the clinical setting, the measurement of intravesical
pressure (IVP) has evolved to the gold standard for estimating
intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) in critically ill patients. However, in
order to study the interplay between flow and pressure in selected
regions of the splanchnic circulation (e.g. in the portal vein), direct
pressure measurements might be indispensable once IVP proves
not accurate enough as an indirect estimate. The intention of our
present study was therefore to compare IVP, a surrogate measure
of IAP, and portal vein pressure (PVP) simultaneously with portal
vein flow (Qpv) measurements in a pig model of fecal peritonitis.
Methods In six anesthetized, mechanically ventilated, and instru-
mented pigs fecal peritonitis was induced by inoculating autologue
feces pellets suspended in saline. The IVP, PVP, and Qpv were
measured before as well as 12 and 24 hours after peritonitis
induction. The IAP was measured by sequentially filling with 25 and
200 ml urine and subsequently re-empting the bladder to 25 ml.
The Qpv was measured by ultrasound Doppler flowmetry. IVP
values at each filling step were compared with the simultaneously
recorded PVP values using a Bland–Altman plot.
Results During peritonitis, IVP overestimates PVP, especially when
the bladder is filled with large fluid volumes (200 ml). Furthermore,
under these conditions even the precision of IVP as an estimate of
PVP vanishes, as shown in the plots by the larger SD. Regardless
of the increases in IVP and PVP, Qpv also increased with peritonitis.
Conclusions We conclude that IVP should be interpreted
cautiously as an estimate of IAP in the presence of fecal peritonitis
in pigs. Under these experimental conditions, the use of a rather
small filling volume is recommended to increase the accuracy of
the measurements. IVP (and PVP) alone do not predict effects on
portal vein flow, at least up to moderately increased levels.

Influence of intra-abdominal hypertension on
microvascular flow in the porcine renal cortex
J Wauters, P Claus, N Brosens, A Wilmer
UZ Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P306 (doi: 10.1186/cc4653)
Background In man, intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) has been
shown to impair renal perfusion. Renal microcirculation is difficult
to study in vivo and little is known about the effect of increased
intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on kidney microcirculation. For the
first time, we evaluated renal cortex microcirculation with side-
stream dark field (SDF) imaging in a porcine model of IAH.
Methods We studied five anesthetized and ventilated pigs (46 ± 3 kg)
during incremental IAP levels (10, 20 and 30 mmHg during 45 min
each) by infusing warmed saline into the peritoneal cavity. The
renal venous pressure (RVP) was measured with a renal vein
catheter. After right mini-lumbotomy and gentle removal of the renal
capsule, the SDF device was positioned intermittently on the renal
cortex, avoiding pressure artefacts. Subsequently, representative
video-clips (10 s) were captured and the microvascular flow index
(MFI) was scored blindly by three independent observers, based
on the semiquantitative method of Boerma and colleagues [1].
Results The MFI decreased significantly from 2.51 ± 0.30 to
1.76 ± 0.26 (P < 0.03) when the IAP increased from 10 to 30 mmHg.
The RVP increased significantly from 10 ± 4 to 34 ± 5 mmHg
(P < 0.00003) with the IAP increasing from 6 to 30 mmHg. There
was an inverse correlation (r = –0.63, P < 0.003) between the MFI
and RVP (Fig. 1).
Conclusion Increased IAP impairs renal cortex microcirculation in
a porcine model of IAH. Renal venous hypertension may account
for this observation.

Ultralow volumes in transvesical intra-abdominal pressure
measurement
I De Laet, E Hoste, J De Waele
UZ Gent, Gent, Belgium
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P307 (doi: 10.1186/cc4654)
Background Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is measured routinely
in patients at risk for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAHT) and
abdominal compartment syndrome. Transvesical measurement of
the IAP has become most widely used technique, but concerns
remain about its accuracy. We recently showed that the use of 50
or 100 ml saline for measurement may lead to overestimation of the
IAP. The goal of this study was to determine the minimal instillation
volume at which an IAP curve can be obtained, and to study
bladder compliance at volumes below 20 ml.
Methods Intra-abdominal pressure was measured transvesically
using a custom-designed IAP monitoring set (BBraun, Zaventem,
Belgium) in 10 critically ill patients at risk for IAHT. Mean age of the
patients was 56 years. Four patients were admitted to the ICU
after an emergency abdominal surgical procedure or abdominal
trauma, the other patients were referred to the ICU because of
acute liver failure with ascites (n = 3), severe sepsis (n = 1), hemor-
rhagic shock (n = 1) or retroperitoneal bleeding and hematoma
(n = 1). Measurements were performed after a median 1 day of
bladder drainage.
After priming the system with normal saline the IAP was measured,
starting without any extra instillation of saline, and continued with
1 ml increments up to 10 ml, after a 1-min equilibration period after
each instillation. After each instillation, an ‘oscillation test’ was
performed, by gently tapping the abdomen until an oscillating curve
could be observed on the monitor. The minimal volume at which
the oscillation test was positive was recorded. These values were
compared to the IAP obtained using 20 ml saline. Data are
presented as the mean (±SD).
Results At 2 ml installed saline volume an oscillation curve could
be obtained in all patients. Mean IAP2ml was 9.3 mmHg (±3.9),
mean IAP10ml was 9.6 mmHg (±4.2) and mean IAP20ml was
10.1 mmHg (±4.2).
In three patients there was no difference between IAP2ml and
IAP20ml, but in six patients the IAP reading at 20 ml was 1 mmHg
higher than that at 2 ml (an average increase of 11.4%), and in one
patient the difference was 2 mmHg (14.2%).
Conclusion In this sample of ICU patients at risk for IAHT, 2 ml
saline was sufficient for IAP signal transduction. Higher volumes for
transvesical IAP measurement resulted in higher pressure readings
in some ICU patients, even at instillation volumes below 20 ml.
Using ultralow volumes for IAP measurement may therefore be
preferable.

Evaluation of the Spiegelberg method and the bladder
method with different intravesical volumes for
measurement of intra-abdominal pressure in a porcine
model of intra-abdominal hypertension
J Wauters, P Claus, N Brosens, M Malbrain, A Wilmer
UZ Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P308 (doi: 10.1186/cc4655)
Background Measurement of intravesical pressure (IVP) is
generally accepted as the gold standard for indirect, intermittent
assessment of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP). However, data
about bladder priming volumes are not uniform: 50–100 ml is
considered adequate but little is known about smaller volumes
(10–15 ml) to prevent falsely high pressures in less compliant
bladders. This study compared bladder pressure measurements
with different priming volumes for assessment of IAP in a porcine
model of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). In addition, we
compared the Spiegelberg method for direct, continuous intra-
peritoneal assessment of IAP versus the intermittent IVP method.
Methods We studied five anesthetized and ventilated pigs (46 ± 3 kg)
in the prone position after insertion of a suprapubic bladder
catheter and an intraperitoneal pressure catheter (Spiegelberg,
Hamburg). We measured IVP with increasing priming volumes (10,
20, 30, 40, 50 ml) at four different IAP levels (baseline, 10, 20,
30 mmHg during 45 min each) achieved by infusing warmed saline
into the peritoneal cavity. Pressure–volume (PV) bladder curves
were constructed for each IAP level. Simultaneously, the Spiegel-
berg pressure (SP) was recorded. The mean difference (bias)
between IVP and SP measurements and the limits of agreement
were calculated according to the method of Bland–Altman.
Results Bias for SP as compared with IVP was maximally
0.9 ± 1.9 mmHg (Table 1). Limits of agreement between SP and
IVP (over all IAP levels) were better for lower priming volumes.
Bladder PV curves showed no significant difference for different
priming volumes (at all IAP levels). However, at an IAP of
25 mmHg, as an example of a critical IAP in clinical practice, the
range of IVP values was 20.1–29.9 mmHg, even with 10 ml as the
preferred distending volume.
Table 1 (abstract P308)
IVP versus SP Bias ± SEM (mmHg) Agreement (mmHg)
IVP (10 ml) – SP 0.1 ± 1.6 –4.8 to 4.9
IVP (20 ml) – SP 0.4 ± 1.8 –5.7 to 6.6
IVP (30 ml) – SP 0.9 ± 1.9 –6.5 to 8.2*
IVP (40 ml) – SP 0.5 ± 1.8 –5.7 to 6.8
IVP (50 ml) – SP 0.9 ± 1.9 –6.0 to 7.8
*P < 0.05 vs 10 ml priming volume.
Conclusion In this model of porcine IAH, measurement of IAP was
not significantly influenced by priming volumes between 10 and
50 ml. The classical IVP measurement demonstrated good
agreement with the Spiegelberg method.

Quantitative relationship between increased intra-
abdominal pressure and intrathoracic pressures and
volumetric filling parameters in the pig
J Wauters, P Claus, N Brosens, M Malbrain, A Wilmer
UZ Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P309 (doi: 10.1186/cc4656)
Background The central venous pressure (CVP) and the
pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) are dependent on
intrathoracic pressure (ITP). A few studies reported 9–73%
transmission of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) to the thoracic
compartment. In a porcine model of intra-abdominal hypertension
(IAH), we studied this transmission and the impact on pressure
and volume parameters of the cardiac preload.
Methods In nine anesthetized pigs (46 ± 3 kg), ventilated with a
constant tidal volume and 5 cmH2O PEEP, the IAP was increased
stepwise from baseline to 30 mmHg. The ITP was measured from
a balloon catheter (air) in the distal oesophagus and the abdomino-
thoracic pressure transmission (APT = [ITP – PEEP × 0.735] /
IAP) was calculated. A pulmonary artery catheter was used to

assess cardiac filling pressures and the transmural CVP (CVPt =
CVP – ITP) and PAOPt were calculated. All pressures were
measured end-expiratory. The global end diastolic volume index
(GEDVI) and extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) were
measured by transpulmonary thermodilution (PICCO; Pulsion).
Results With increasing IAP, the ITP increased significantly
(Table 1). The APT decreased significantly from 48% to 27%
(mean 35%) with unchanged EVLWI. While the CVP and PAOP
parallelled changes in IAP, the CVPt, PAOPt and GEDVI remained
constant.

*P < 0.05 vs baseline.
Conclusion About 35% of the IAP is transmitted to the thoracic
compartment, but the APT decreases with increasing IAP, due to
decreasing thoracic compliance. In the setting of IAH, the CVPt
and PAOPt or volumetric parameters are superior in the
assessment of cardiac preload.

Introduction The aim of this study was evaluating the correlation
between intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) [1] in critically ill patients admitted to our ICU.
Methods Reported are the preliminary results of a prospective
study. During a 10-month period 18 patients consecutively admitted
with secondary or tertiary abdominal sepsis were enrolled in this
study and divided into two groups: in the first group five patients
underwent abdominal surgery with open laparostomy before ICU
admission; in the second group 13 patient were treated without
surgical intervention. The SOFA score and IAP were recorded once
every 8 hours, for the first 3 days from admission, for a total of 162
records. The IAP was measured with the Kron open system single
measurement technique [2]. The Pearson correlation coefficient
between the IAP and SOFA score was calculated for all patients
and separately for the laparostomy and the nonlaparostomy groups.
Results No evident correlation has been found between IAP and
SOFA score in the group of all patients. A Pearson linear
correlation of 0.46 occurred in the nonlaparostomized group. A
less significant value in the laparostomized group was found but
with an inversed correlation.
Conclusion These preliminary results suggest that a correlation
between IAP and SOFA could be found in selected critically ill
groups.

Effect of vasopressin and norepinephrine on renal blood
flow in a canine model of raised intra-abdominal pressure

Introduction Increasing intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is
associated with a decrease in renal blood flow [1]. Abdominal
perfusion pressure (APP) is calculated as the mean arterial
pressure (MAP) – IAP. We investigated whether restoration of APP
in dogs with the use of vasopressin (VP) and norepinephrine (NE)
could increase renal blood flow under conditions of raised IAP.
Methods Ten mongrel dogs (average weight 20 ± 3 kg) were
anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated with 100% oxygen and
halothane. The IAP was altered by filling a 3 l intraperitoneal bag
with varying volumes of normal saline and the IAP was measured
by the urinary catheter technique. Ultrasonic transit-time flow
probes were placed around the ascending aorta and left renal
artery. After baseline readings, the IAP was increased to 10, 20
and 30 mmHg. Preload was maintained by a continuous infusion of
500 ml/hour normal saline. At each level of IAP, the MAP was
restored to achieve the baseline APP with VP and NE infusion,
followed by decompression. The MAP, IAP, and renal blood flow
(RBF) were measured.
Results The average baseline MAP was 75 ± 10 mmHg. The
mean baseline RBF was 180 ± 60 ml/min. Incrementally increasing
the IAP from baseline resulted in a progressive decrease in RBF
(Table 1). The RBF (ml/min) achieved following the use of NE and
VP to return the APP to the baseline APP of 70–75 mmHg is
shown (Table 1). RBF after decompression (no vasopressor) is
also shown.
Conclusion In dogs an increase in IAP results in an incremental
decrease in RBF. Using VP to restore the APP to baseline does
not reverse the decrease in RBF. At moderate levels of IAH, using
NE improves restoring APP to baseline and improves RBF, but
does not return it to baseline values.

Indocyanine green clearance as a predictor of outcome in
liver transplant patients

Institute of Liver Studies, Kings College Hospital, London, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P312 (doi: 10.1186/cc4659)
Introduction Invasive measurement of indocyanine green clearance
(ICG) has been shown to predict the outcome after liver
transplantation in a small series of patients. A non-invasive technique
using ICG plasma disappearance rate (PDR) has recently been
shown to correlate well with invasive techniques. We report our
experience of ICG PDR in a large cohort of liver transplant patients.
Methods The ICG PDR was measured by the LiMON (PULSION
Medical Systems) finger probe after injection of 0.25 mg/kg ICG in
79 patients after orthotopic liver transplantation. Clinical and
laboratory markers of overall organ and liver graft function were
recorded at the time of ICG measurement. Associations with
duration of ICU admission, early graft failure and 3-month survival
were also analysed. Values are presented as the median
(interquartile range).
Results Twenty-four out of 79(30%) were transplanted for acute
liver failure (ALF). Eighty-one grafts were implanted, two patients
undergoing retransplantation for primary graft failure. Twenty-one
(27%) patients died, five of whom had ALF. Variables for the whole
group at the time of ICG clearance were: APACHE II 17 (11.5–22),
SAPS 46 (33–63), lactate 2 mmol/l (1.2–3.5), INR 1.4 (1.2–1.7),
AST 563 IU/l (158–1268) and bilirubin 75 mmol/l (27–128).
Correlations were observed between the ICG PDR and SAPS (r =
–0.45, P < 0.001), APACHE II (r = –0.23, P = 0.04), bilirubin (r =
–0.57, P = < 0.001) and length of ICU stay (r = –0.32, P = 0.014).
No relationship was seen with typical markers of graft function
(lactate, AST and INR). In grafts implanted into patients with
chronic liver disease (n = 57), the ICG correlated with SAPS and
bilirubin (r = –0.55, P < 0.001; r = –0.62, P < 0.001 respectively).
However, for those with ALF, only the bilirubin had an association
with ICG PDR (r = –0.44, P = 0.029). The median ICG PDR in
survivors was significantly higher than in those who died; 15
(10.2–21)%/min vs 9.8 (5–16.3)%/min (P = 0.01). No significant
difference was seen between survivors or nonsurvivors in the ALF
group, although similar significant differences were observed
between survivors and nonsurvivors in the chronic liver disease
group. In those whose death was directly attributable to poor graft
function, the median ICG PDR was lower; 4.8 vs 10.5%/min (NS).
Using a receiver–operator characteristic curve, a cutoff value for
ICG-PDR of 9.5%/min identified graft failure (requiring retransplan-
tation) or patient death with a sensitivity of 78% and specificity 50%.
Conclusion Non-invasive ICG PDR is a useful marker of outcome
in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation. The
multifactorial nature of ICG clearance is demonstrated by strong
correlations with composite measures of organ function.

Value of serial serum lactate evaluation in liver transplant
patients at the ICU

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P313 (doi: 10.1186/cc4660)
Objective To determine the role of serial serum lactate evaluation
in patients submitted to orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) and its
correlation with classic hepatic laboratorial parameters.
Design A retrospective case–control study in a 16-bed
medical–surgical ICU.
Methods Patients submitted to OLT with an ICU stay >72 hours
were retrospectively studied during the immediate postsurgery
period at the ICU. For comparative purposes, a control group of
OTL patients that were discharged from the ICU uneventfully was
studied (n = 23, mean age years, mean ICU stay days). Patients
with complications were evaluated (n = 17, mean age years, mean
ICU stay days): nine vascular complications (seven with
documented venous thrombosis, two with documented arterial
thrombosis), one hepatic aspergillosis, one acute cellular rejection,
two graft primary nonfunction, one biliary system stenosis and
three intrahepatic colestasis. These patients were further divided
based on a biochemical pattern of liver laboratory parameters:
hepatocellular (increased ALT and AST) or cholestatic (increased
GGT and total bilirubin). Serial serum lactate measurements were
evaluated, and compared with the biochemical profile of liver
function parameters. Hemodynamic instability during surgery was
also considered, as well as APACHE II and SAPS II scores. A
statistical analysis was performed. Patients with twofold and 1.5-
fold increases in any biochemical parameter were identified and
were cross-examined by a chi-squared test, considering P < 0.05
significant.
Results In the control group, serum lactate decreased rapidly,
along with other biochemical parameters. Patients with complica-
tions presented a higher serum lactate at first measurement (9.4 vs
6.7 mmol/l, P = 0.046), and a higher SAPS II score (22.3 ± 9.6 vs
40.1 ± 15.5, P < 0.001). Female sex and hemodynamic instability
also correlated with the presence of complications. All vascular
complications were characterized by an increase in serum AST
and ALT. A 1.5-fold increase in lactate correlated strongly with a
similar increase in ALT and AST (P < 0.001) and less with an
increase in cholestatic parameters (P = 0.02). A twofold increase
in serum lactate correlated well with a similar increase in AST and
ALT (P = 0.005) but not with cholestatic parameters.
Conclusions A 1.5-fold increase in serum lactate after OLT
correlated well with all complications observed. A twofold increase
correlated only with complications that led to an increase in ALT
and AST, particularly vascular.

Monitoring of lactate and base deficit: what is their role in
the predictive outcome of severe trauma?

Rummo Hospital, Benvento, Italy
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P314 (doi: 10.1186/cc4661)
Background The evaluation of cellular metabolism in the critically
ill patient, through measurement of the arterial lactate and arterial
base deficit parameters, has proved to be a good means to guide
the therapy and provide the outcome. We wanted to verify the
prognostic ability of the blood lactate level and of the base deficit
in patients with severe trauma surveyed during their recovery.
Methods The values of the blood lactate level and of the base
deficit were considered in 33 patients with severe trauma (ISS > 15)
and observed from their arrival in the ICU (T0) for 24 hours (T24).
The data of dead and live patients were analysed with the Student
t statistical method.
Results Ten of the 33 recovering (ISS 30) patients died. In the
dead patients, medium values of lactate were more elevated than in
discharged patients: T0 – dead patients 3.98 ± 4.03 mmol/l (min

0.5, max 11.8) vs live 2.13 ± 1.33 mmol/l (min 0.5, max 6.8); T24 –
dead patients 2.57 ± 2.65 mmol/l (min 0.4, max 7.1) vs live 1.22 ±
0.86 mmol/l (min 0.4, max 4) (P = 0.037). The analysis of the trend
of the base deficit cannot prove a statistically important difference:
at T24 dead patients –2.57 ± 3.44 (min –9, max 2.1), and
survivors 1.05 ± 7.18 (min –14, max 9.6) (P = 0.141).
Conclusions The measurement of lactates seems to be a good
index of prognosis. In particular, the values revealed during 24 hours
are more predictable, perhaps because they are probable proof of
the capacity of recovering the hypoperfusion of tissues and the
anaerobic metabolism that is the cause of the development of
organ failure and future complications. On the contrary, the
analysis of the base deficit has less prognostic capacity because it
is conditioned by other factors such as employed solutions, renal
compensations, the rate of vascular filling and possible breathing
deficit. In conclusion, the monitoring of blood lactate levels can be
a good aid in guiding therapy in its initial phases and predicting the
outcome of patients.

A novel therapeutic concept for the treatment of acute
angioedema attacks in hereditary angioedema patients:
multiple successful treatments even in severe swelling
attacks with the bradykinin-B2 receptor antagonist Icatibant
M Bas, J Greve, G Kojda, H Bier, T Hoffmann
Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf, Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P315 (doi: 10.1186/cc4662)
Several forms of angioedema seem to be induced by elevated
bradykinin (BK) concentrations. They are either caused by
increased BK production, as is the case in hereditary angioedema
(HAE) involving the lack of a functional C1-esterase inhibitor, or by
reduced BK inactivation (e.g. during ACE-inhibitor treatment). BK-
induced angioedema does not respond to the current standard
treatment for angioedema caused by increased histamine levels,
corticosteroids and antihistamines.
Until now acute attacks of HAE have been treated with intra-
venously administered C1-esterase inhibitor concentrate derived
from human plasma. However, no specific treatment has been
approved for ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema. It would be
necessary that such an approach inhibits directly the activation of
the bradykinin-B2 receptor by BK.
During the ongoing international phase III HAE study FAST2, we
treated several HAE patients subcutaneously with Icatibant, a
specific bradykinin-B2 receptor antagonist. In the open-label part
of this study we administered Icatibant for the treatment of 21
acute HAE attacks. Eleven attacks were located in the head–neck
region, of which three involved the laryngeal area, six the abdominal
and four the genital area. Following treatment with Icatibant,
patients reported rapid onset of symptom relief and complete
remission of symptoms within a few hours. We were especially
impressed by the successful treatment of the edema involving the
laryngeal area. The study drug was safe and well tolerated. We
have noted short-lived local injection site reactions, which resolved
spontaneously without intervention.
In our hands Icatibant showed high efficacy for the treatment of
acute HAE attacks with a rapid onset of symptom relief.
Subcutaneous administration might improve the quality of life for
HAE patients. Icatibant could also represent a new therapeutic
paradigm for the treatment of ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema
cases but this hypothesis needs to be tested in a clinical study.

Impact of early sepsis on oxygen delivery in the
microvasculature

Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P316 (doi: 10.1186/cc4663)
A defining characteristic of sepsis is progressive blood flow
dysfunction in the microvasculature in organs remote to the original
site of injury. Previous work has established that microvascular
oxygen transport is compromised in sepsis due to a loss of perfused
capillaries. In a companion study to this project, which investigated
the role of leukocyte traffic in sepsis, it was observed that increased
transit times of leukocytes passing through the capillary bed not only
resulted in the occlusion of some capillaries but also served to cause
some vessels to experience prolonged periods of low flow. The
objective of the present study was to examine how the progressive
loss of functional capillary density (FCD) impacts oxygen transport
and consumption in skeletal muscle during sepsis. Hemodynamic
and oxygen saturation data from video recordings are incorporated
into an experiment-based mathematical model of oxygen transport in
a 3D volume. This modeling helps to further our understanding of the
impact capillary loss has on tissue oxygenation and consumption.
Sepsis was induced in rats by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP).
Rats received crystalloid fluid resuscitation to maintain the blood
pressure and hematocrit at baseline levels. Microvascular flow was
observed in the extensor digitorum muscle using a dual wavelength
intravital video microscopy set-up. The same field of view was
recorded at 30-min intervals between 2 and 5 hours post CLP to
follow the progression of capillary dysfunction. Individual capillaries
were analyzed for oxygen saturations and hemodynamics. As sepsis
progressed we observed that the capillaries’ hemodynamic profiles
transiently change between normal, stopped and fast flow states.
Although it has previously been assumed that once a capillary
becomes occluded flow is not easily re-established, we observed
that capillaries could suddenly become reperfused after being
occluded for up to 1 hour or more. The occlusion of capillaries was
found to decrease oxygen saturations in nearby vessels by as much
as 20%. Subsequent recruitment of previously unperfused capillaries
was shown to increase saturations in adjacent vessels by as much
as 50%. Changes in perfusion of adjacent vessels had a greater
impact on oxygen saturations than changes in hematocrit or velocity
in the vessel itself. At 2, 3 and 4 hours post CLP the percentage of
stopped flow vessels was 17%, 28% and 48% in CLP compared
with 13%, 13% and 20% in sham. The extent of FCD loss is
progressive over the course of the injury. However, it is important to
note that while the percentage of occluded capillaries increases, the
individual vessels constituting this percentage were variable. Our
study suggests that in this early stage where the FCD is in transition,
affected tissue experiences dynamic changes in tissue oxygenation.
This highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms
responsible for this dynamic change in FCD.

are valuable tools for visualization and study of the microcirculation.
Unfortunately, the widespread current practice of using a (digital)
video recorder and subsequent transfer to a computer results in data
loss. This is due to video compression and nonoptimal use of the
available dynamic range. In order to be able to develop and use
software for automated data analysis we should strive for the highest
possible image quality. Here we describe a simple and cost-effective
method for obtaining significant improvement of data quality.
Methods A 10-bit frame-grabber board (NI PCI-1409; National
Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) was used for online capture of
noncompressed video data from an SDF device. The 10-bit data
was real-time converted to optimized 8-bit data by a dynamic
scaling algorithm, compressing the excess 1024 gray values into
the standard 256 gray values and thereby mathematically
correcting for the offset. The converted data were written to hard
disk as an uncompressed AVI file. The data stream of 2.5 Gb/min
was handled by a 3 MHz Pentium-4 PC with two 250-Gbyte hard
disks in the Raid 1 mode. Software was written in LabView
(version 7.1; National Instruments).
Results The system routinely delivers excellent dynamic range and
resolving power in a clinical setting. Figure 1 is an example from a
sublingual measurement in a healthy volunteer. The white bar equals
a distance of 100 mm, the right panel is a magnification the marked
area and the arrow indicates single erythrocytes within a capillary.
Conclusion A major improvement in the dynamic range (typically a
factor 2) can be obtained by 10-bit data acquisition followed by 8-
bit conversion by a dynamic scaling algorithm. Furthermore,
noncompressed video data offer a better image quality in terms of
resolving power of single erythrocytes and extremely small vessels.
It is expected that the improved data quality will ease automatic
analysis by future software.

Introduction Microcirculation is severely affected in sepsis. The
non-invasive evaluation of microcirculation and its association with
the severity of sepsis has not been sufficiently studied.
Objective To compare microcirculation parameters with sepsis
severity.
Methods We studied 23 patients of a general ICU (age 56 ± 21
years) and 11 healthy volunteers (age 28 ± 4 years). Severity of
sepsis was assessed with the SOFA score (5 ± 2), APACHE II
score (13 ± 5) and sepsis severity category (SIRS n = 15, severe
sepsis n = 4 and septic shock n = 4). An InSpectra® near-infrared
spectrometer was used to measure the thenar muscle tissue
oxygen saturation (StO2) before, during and after a 3-min occlusion
of the brachial artery. For the occlusion we used a brachial cuff and
raised the pressure 50 mmHg above the measured systolic blood
pressure. For the StO2 curve analysis we used the InSpectra®
Software Analysis program. For the statistical analysis we used
SPSS 11.5 for Windows® and applied one-way ANOVA.
Results The StO2 baseline value was significantly lower in patients
with severe sepsis when compared with healthy controls (65 ± 15
[49, 85] vs 83 ± 6 [72, 93], P = 0.009). During the 3-min
occlusion of the brachial artery the StO2 decrease rate was
significantly lower in the septic shock group compared with healthy
controls (15.5 ± 6.3 [6.5–21.4] vs 38.7 ± 10.3 [22.1–52.9],
P < 0.001) as well as compared with the SIRS group (15.5 ± 6.3
[6.5–21.4] vs 25.4 ± 7.2 [17.8–43.4], P = 0.036). The StO2
decrease rate was also significantly lower in the severe sepsis
group when compared with healthy controls (15.0 ± 0.6 [14.4–16.0]
vs 38.7 ± 10.3 [22.1–52.9], P < 0.001) as well as compared with
the SIRS group (15.0 ± 0.6 [14.4–16.0] vs 25.4 ± 7.2 [17.8–43.4],
P = 0.028). After the release of the occlusion, the StO2 increase
rate was significantly lower in the SIRS, severe sepsis and septic
shock groups when compared with healthy controls (402.1 ± 140.1
[206.2–653.5] vs 643.8 ± 241.4 [389.0–1275.0], P = 0.002;
322.4 ± 162.6 [185.5–520.5] vs 643.8 ± 241.4 [389.0–1275.0],
P = 0.005; and 219.3 ± 136.3 [82.4–404.5] vs 643.8 ± 241.4
[389.0–1275.0], P < 0.001, respectively).
Conclusions Tissue oxygen saturation is related to the severity of
sepsis. Additionally, tissue oxygen consumption is significantly
lower in patients with septic shock or severe sepsis compared with
healthy subjects or patients with SIRS. The lower StO2 increase
rate in ICU patients may indicate affected endothelium reactivity.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P319 (doi: 10.1186/cc4666)
Objective We hypothesized that a decrease in tissue oxygen
saturation (StO2) could be detected in patients during weaning
failure. To this end, we determined the changes in StO2 during
weaning trials from mechanical ventilation using near-infrared
spectroscopy (NIRS).
Patients and methods We studied 16 consecutive, mechanically
ventilated patients (age 61 ± 15 years, SOFA score 4.5 ± 1.4),
whose physician had judged them ready to wean, during a 2-hour
T-piece weaning trial. The weaning trial was defined as successful
when the patient was able to sustain spontaneous breathing
without distress. Oxygenation, respiratory rate (RR), and minute
ventilation (VE) were measured before and either at 2 hours after
disconnection from the ventilator in patients with successful
weaning trial, or at the time of reconnection to the ventilator in
those with a failed one. The thenar muscle StO2 was measured
non-invasively by NIRS (InSpectra; Hutchinson Technology, USA),
at the same time points, by the arterial occlusion method.
Results Eleven patients had successful and five had failed
weaning trials. The SaO2, respiratory rate, and VE on mechanical
ventilation were not different between the two groups. During the
weaning trial, the SaO2 was decreased in the failure group (from
99% to 92%, P = 0.027), the RR was increased (from 20 to 43

breaths/min, P < 0.05) while the VE did not change significantly
(from 11 to 12.8 l/min, P = 0.55). These variables did not change
significantly in the success group. The StO2 baseline on
mechanical ventilation was not different between failure and
success group patients (72.8% and 78.2%, respectively). At the
end of the weaning trial the StO2 baseline was decreased to 65%
in failure group patients (P = 0.05), while it did not change in the
success group. The StO2 decrease rate on mechanical ventilation
was not different between the two groups. At the end of the
weaning trial, the StO2 decrease rate was significantly lower in
failure group patients compared with that of the success group
(13.3 ± 2.6 vs 22.5 ± 10.9, P = 0.026).
Conclusion These results indicate that microcirculation, as it is
monitored by the NIRS technique, might be impaired in patients
who fail to wean from mechanical ventilation. Further study is
needed to define the role of this method during weaning from
mechanical ventilation.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P320 (doi: 10.1186/cc4667)
Objective Aiming at a better understanding of the microcirculatory
deficits that characterize the septic condition, we measured local
hemoglobin oxygen saturation (= tissue oxygen saturation [StO2])
using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (Hutchinson Technology,
USA) before and during experimental human endotoxemia. The
baseline StO2 may represent the vasodilatory state, the decline in
StO2 during ischemia the tissue oxygen consumption, the slope of
increase in StO2 after the ischemic period vascular reactivity, and
the area under the curve after reperfusion the flow debt repayment.
Methods Five healthy subjects received an i.v. dose of 2 ng/kg E.
coli O:113 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and five subjects served as
controls. Before, 2 and 4 hours after the administration of LPS/
placebo the StO2 was measured in the thenar skeletal muscle before,
during and after a 1.5-min period of arterial occlusion (inflating an
upper-arm cuff 50 mmHg above the systolic blood pressure). Data
are expressed as the mean ± SEM. Differences were tested by paired
Student t tests. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance.
Results The control subjects showed that time itself did not change
the response to ischaemia as measurements at t = 0, 2 and 4 hours
demonstrated similar changes in StO2. LPS administration induced
the expected flu-like symptoms, fever, and the decrease in mean
arterial pressure and the increase in heart rate. Experimental
endotoxemia resulted in an increase in the baseline StO2 from 79 ±
4% at t = 0 to 87 ± 4% at t = 2 hours (P = 0.07) and 94 ± 1% at
t = 4 hours (P = 0.049) after LPS administration. The decline in
StO2 during ischemia and the slope of increase during reperfusion
was not influenced by endotoxemia. However, the area under the
curve after reperfusion decreased from 18 ± 4 AU at t = 0, to 10 ±
4 at t = 2 hours (P = 0.04) and 6 ± 1 AU at t = 4 hours (P = 0.03)
after the administration of LPS.
Conclusions During human endotoxemia the vasodilatory state is
represented by an increase in baseline StO2. Oxygen consumption
during ischemia and vascular reactivity after reperfusion is not
influenced by endotoxemia. After the ischemic period, during
reperfusion, flow debt repayment significantly decreases during
endotoxemia. NIRS is a valuable tool that will facilitate future
experiments that study inflammatory-associated changes in the
microcirculation.

Introduction Peripheral microcirculation is affected by extra-
corporeal circulation, hypothermia and anesthesia in patients under-
going cardiac surgery. The alterations of peripheral microcircula-
tion and their relation to the hemodynamic status in these patients
have not yet been studied.
Objective To compare microcirculation parameters with the post-
operative hemodynamic status of these patients.
Methods We studied seven postoperative cardiac patients (five
males/two females, 69 ± 6 years) during the immediate post-
operative period. All were receiving inotropic agents (11 nor-
epinephrine, 15 dobutamine, three adrenaline, four levosimendan).
We used Swan–Ganz catheterization to assess the cardiac index
and mixed venous blood oxygen saturation (SvO2) values. We
used the InSpectra near-infrared spectrometer (NIRS) to monitor
the thenar muscle tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and the total
hemoglobin index (THI) (which reflects the sum of oxyhemoglobin
and deoxyhemoglobin) at baseline.
Results The hemodynamic parameters of our patients were: MAP
79 ± 10 mmHg, CVP 8 ± 4 cmH2O, PCWP 11 ± 2 mmHg, MPAP
27 ± 7 mmHg, CI 2.6 ± 0.7 l/min/m2, SVR 1243 ± 318 dyne ×
s/cm5, PVR 309 ± 139 dyne × s/cm5, HR 93 ± 7 bpm, DO2 706
± 209 l/min. Laboratory values were: Hb 10.4 ± 1.5 g/dl, lactate
2.4 ± 1.2 mg/dl. We found a significant correlation between StO2
at baseline and the cardiac index (r = 0.85, P < 0.001) and
between the THI at baseline and the cardiac index (r = 0.88,
P < 0.001). The StO2 at baseline also significantly correlated with
SvO2 (r = 0.94, P < 0.001).
Conclusions Non-invasively acquired tissue oxygen saturation
values correlate with hemodynamic indices. This suggests that
non-invasive monitoring of the microcirculation might be used for
the management of postoperative cardiac patients. Further studies
are needed to confirm these findings.

Introduction Oxygen delivery represents one side of the global
oxygen flux equation. Normal physiology suggests that cardiac
output is linked to tissue metabolic requirement. In sick patients
this linkage is frequently abnormal and the ability to maintain tissue
oxygen delivery is a prognostic variable. An increasing number of
randomised controlled clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown
that early manipulation oxygen delivery in certain groups of critically
ill patients can reduce morbidity and mortality [1]. Despite a
growing bibliography supporting targeting and maintaining oxygen
delivery, it is rarely calculated or its level appreciated, despite the
fact that the cardiac output has been measured. We have formed a

CO monitoring and protocolised resuscitation of haemodynamically
unstable patients using fluid challenges.
Hypothesis This study was designed to assess the range and
clinical appreciation oxygen delivery in patients admitted to the ICU.
Methods The cardiac index and oxygen delivery index were
measured using the LiDCO plus monitor in 106 critically ill adult
patients admitted with a variety of diagnoses, to General Intensive
Care at Southampton Hospital.
Results For the purposes of this study the normal range was taken
as being the normal value ± 30%. Values below the range would
be considered as being low. Indexed results were used to
compensate for patient size.
Conclusion Two patients in the study group had a cardiac index
below the calculated normal range; however, the DO2I (Fig. 1)
showed a fivefold variation across the group, with 31/106 (30%)
patients having a DO2I considered low. These findings were
covert, coincident with anaemia and/or poor respiratory gas
exchange. In the majority of these patients there had been a failure
to appreciate the low DO2I and clinical management changes were
subsequently considered. The continuous measurement of the
cardiac index and DO2I enabled early identification and enhanced
standard of care for patients with low DO2I. These patients may
represent the subgroup of critical care patients, cited by RCT
evidence, whose survival may be enhanced by CO augmentation
and optimisation of oxygen delivery. Because these patients were
high risk with potentially serious management implications from
DO2 measurement errors, clinical confidence in the data was
provided by calibration with lithium dilution.

Pulse contour analysis for cardiac output measurement in
patients after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: a
comparison of FloTrac and PiCCOplus with intermittent
thermodilution

Introduction Pulse contour analysis calibrated by transpulmonary
thermodilution (PiCCOplus; Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich,
Germany) has shown in the past years to be a reliable alternative to
the pulmonary artery catheter for cardiac output (CO) assessment
in different clinical settings [1,2]. A new pulse contour analysis
device, which does not need an external calibration (FloTrac/
Vigileo; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine CA, USA), recently became
available. The aim of this study was to compare the CO determined
by the FloTrac sensor (FCO) and by the PiCCOplus system (PCO)
with the CO assessed by intermittent thermodilution (ICO).
Methods With local ethic committee approval, patients after
elective off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were studied
under different conditions in the ICU. For one set of data (A =
‘haemodynamic stable’) the CO was assessed following haemo-
dynamic stabilization and calibration of the PiCCOplus. Triplicate
FCO and PCO values were recorded within 3 min before the ICO
was determined by three repeated injections at four time points
with intervals of 15 min. For the second set of data (B = ‘haemo-
dynamic changes’) triplicate FCO, PCO and ICO measurements
were recorded 15 min after inducing CO changes by different
body positions (supine 1, 30° head-up, 30° head-down, supine 2).
Mean arterial pressure was maintained ≥70 mmHg by adjustment
of norepinephrine infusion. Statistical analysis was performed using
ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni/Dunn correction, t test and
Bland–Altman analysis for absolute CO values and percentage
changes (∆ = trend analysis) of CO during A and B. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results Seventy-two matched sets of data were obtained from
nine patients (ASA III, female/male ratio = 2/7, age = 63.0 ± 9.5
years, BMI = 24.8 ± 2.2 kg/m2). CO values recorded during A
ranged from 3.30 to 6.56 l/min, no significant CO changes
between measurement points were recorded (∆FCO = –0.8 ±
14.8%, ∆PCO = –0.9 ± 15.3%, ∆ICO = –1.9 ± 12.8%). Bland–
Altman analysis revealed a mean bias ± 2SD (limits of agreement)
of –0.13 ± 1.08 l/min for FCO-ICO and of 0.08 ± 0.91 l/min for
PCO-ICO. Differences of ∆CO were comparable (mean bias ±
2SD = 1.1 ± 24.8% for ∆FCO – ∆ICO and 1.0 ± 24.8% for

∆PCO – ∆ICO). A range of CO values from 2.85 to 8.60 l/min
were obtained during B with significant changes of FCO, PCO and
ICO between the measurement points (Table 1 and Fig. 1). The
mean bias ± 2SD was –0.14 ± 1.82 l/min for FCO-ICO and
–0.17 ± 1.13 l/min for PCO-ICO. For ∆FCO – ∆ICO a mean bias
± 2SD of –2.8 ± 36.4% was observed, whereas for ∆PCO –
∆ICO the mean bias ± 2SD was 0.9 ± 13.2%.
Conclusions These preliminary results indicate that cardiac output
in patients after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting can be
reliably monitored by both tested pulse contour analysis devices
(FloTrac and PiCCOplus system) during stable haemodynamic
conditions. However, the FloTrac system showed a tendency to
overestimate rapid decreases and increases of cardiac output
when compared with the PiCCOplus system.

Introduction Assessment of continuous cardiac output using the
arterial pulse cardiac index (APCI) is nowadays available also with
only standard radial artery catheterization with a transducer (Vigileo
System, FloTrac™; Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) [1,2]. It
does not require calibration (thermodilution or any) but rather bases
its calculations on arterial waveform characteristics in conjunction
with patient demographic data. The aim of the study was to assess
the level of agreement between a continuous APCI and continuous
cardiac index (CCI) and intermittent cardiac index (ICI) obtained
with a pulmonary artery catheter (Intellicath) in cirrhotic patients
with hyperdynamic conditions.
Methods Hemodynamic measurements were obtained in 14 liver-
transplanted patients. ICI measurements were collected after ICU
admission and every 8 hours until the 48th postoperative hour.
Continuous data were collected every hour after ICU admission to
the 48th postoperative hour. Statistical analysis was performed
using the method described by Bland and Altman. Statistical
significance was considered P < 0.05.
Results Data are presented standardized by body surface area.
The mean difference between APCI–ICI (bias ± 2SD) was 0.48 ±
1.40 l/min/m2 together with 95% confidence intervals of –0.92 to
1.88 l/min/m2. The mean difference between APCI–CCI (bias ±
2SD) was 0.90 ± 1.49 l/min/m2 together with 95% confidence
intervals of –0.59 to 2.39 l/min/m2.
Conclusions APCI obtained with the Vigileo System provided
comparable measurements of cardiac output in hyperdynamic
conditions. Larger population studies are needed to confirm these
preliminary data.

A calibrated pulse waveform analysis algorithm, which
determines continuous cardiac output, compared with a
noncalibrated algorithm

Introduction We compared two pulse waveform analysis algorithms
for measuring continuous cardiac output; PulseCO (LiDCO UK Ltd),
which requires a transpulmonary indicator dilution (TPID) calibration;
and the Pressure Recording Analytical Method (PRAM) (most~care,
FIAB, Italy), which does not require calibration but requires the user
to define whether the patient is septic or nonseptic. No study has
compared these two methods simultaneously in adults.
Methods Arterial pulse waveforms were collected prospectively
from 11 patients (seven male, age 36–75 years) requiring haemo-
dynamic monitoring, and were stored electronically and then
replayed through each device. Nine patients were deemed ‘septic’
on the study day by standard clinical criteria. Each patient had a
(TPID) cardiac output (CO) measurement prior to pulse wave
collection (lithium dilution or thermodilution) to allow prospective
calibration of the PulseCO software. The duration of continuous
waveform collection was between 55 and 145 min, and these were
replayed through the septic and nonseptic settings of the PRAM.
Thirty second CO measurements were collected with the

proprietary data acquisition software. Comparisons were made
between: PulseCO(c) (TPID calibrated) to PRAM(cp) (set to clinical
picture, i.e. septic or nonseptic); PulseCO(c) to PRAM(bf) (set to
‘retrospective best fit’); and PulseCO(c) to PRAM(c) (in line with the
clinical picture and mathematically calibrated to the TPID). It was
only possible to include seven patients in the PRAM(bf) analysis.
Results One patient was in extremis at the time of data collection,
requiring epinephrine boluses, and was excluded, leaving 10
patients in the analysis group. The mean flow, bias and precision
(±2SD) of PulseCO(c) to PRAM(cp), of PulseCO(c) to PRAM (bf),
and of PulseCO(c) to PRAM(c) were: 6.86, –0.58 and ±6.03 l/min;
6.24, 0.88 and ±1.55 l/min; and 6.67, –0.21 and ±2.23 l/min,
respectively. The 95% limits of agreement for PulseCO(c) to
PRAM(cp), for PulseCO(c) to PRAM (bf), and for PulseCO(c) to
PRAM(c) were 88%, 24.9% and 34%.
Conclusions The CCO algorithm in the PRAM does not trend
acceptably with PulseCO. Even though the precision of PRAM(bf)
was acceptable (in seven patients) the settings were inconsistent
with the clinical presentation. The noncalibrated PRAM is currently
not suitable for continuous cardiac output monitoring in the ICU.

Introduction It is known that measurement of the intrathoracic
blood volume (ITBV) is a more accurate estimate of cardiac
preload than pressure measurements using central venous or
pulmonary artery occlusion pressures. Extravascular lung water
(EVLW) is defined as the value of the intrathoracic thermal volume
minus the ITBV. An increase in EVLW is the pathophysiological
basis for the development of pulmonary edema (PE). There is
evidence to suggest that therapy to reduce EVLW may improve
outcome in the critically ill patient. The bedside assessment of
EVLW may be very useful in identifying and quantifying PE, and
hence in selecting patients who might benefit from a fluid
restriction/depletion therapeutic strategy based on EVLW
monitoring. The PiCCO (Pulsion, Munich, Germany) provides an
estimate of the ITBV, EVLW, and permeability index (PI) via a single
transpulmonary thermodilution technique. PE is defined as the
abnormal accumulation of fluid in the extravascular space of the
lung. ALI/ARDS is characterized by pulmonary edema. PE consists
of increased hydrostatic PE (cardiogenic PE) and increased
permeability PE (ALI/ARDS). Increased permeability PE (ALI/ARDS)
is further classified into direct lung injury type and indirect lung
injury type. PI was calculated as the ratio of EVLW to ITBV, which
was previously shown to reflect permeability of the alveolar–
capillary barrier. The early recognition and differential diagnosis of
direct lung injury and indirect lung injury may be challenging.
Objective To clarify whether differentiation with direct injury ALI/
ARDS and indirect injury ALI/ARDS is possible by parameters
obtained from PiCCO systems.
Materials and methods We studied 10 patients, four with direct
ALI/ARDS and six with indirect ALI/ARDS (sepsis induced). Direct
ALI/ARDS consisted of two aspiration and two pneumonia. All
patients in indirect ALI/ARDS were sepsis. Nine of the patients
were male, one was female; aged 27–85 years. All patients were
mechanically ventilated in the pressure mode. GEDV, ITBV and
EVLW were measured by the PiCCO and the PI was calculated.
Data are presented as the mean ± SD. For statistical analysis a
paired t test was performed.
Results One hundred and twenty measurements were available for
analysis. ITBVI and EVLWI were significantly higher in indirect ALI/
ARDS than in direct ALI/ARDS. PI (PVPI = EVLW/ITBV) was
significantly higher in direct ALI/ARDS than in indirect ALI/ARDS.
See Table 1.
Table 1 (abstract P326)
Direct Indirect P value
ITBVI 984 ± 331.7 1279 ± 312.1 0.0001
EVLWI 13.2 ± 4.7 16.8 ± 6.5 0.014
PI 0.59 ± 0.27 0.44 ± 0.22 0.006
Conclusions Measurement of the ITBV, EVLW and PI using the
PiCCO system contributes to differentiating between direct and
indirect ALI/ARDS and to determining the therapeutic strategy for
critically ill patients. These data are an important variable for
increased permeability PE, direct injury and indirect injury
ALI/ARDS, and may be very helpful for guiding fluid therapy in
critically ill patients. There is a possibility that data such as the ITBI,
EVLWI and PI obtained from the PiCCO system might be included
in the diagnostic criteria ARDS in the future.

Introduction The anaerobic metabolism causes lactate to
increase. This is accompanied by a reduction in bicarbonate
concentration in the blood, causing CO2 production (VCO2) to
accelerate, evidenced as an increased respiratory CO2 output.
Over the physiological range of CO2 content the CO2 tension is
linearly related to CO2 content, and the venoarterial CO2 tension
difference (DPCO2) could be used as a surrogate for the
difference between mixed venous and arterial CO2 contents.
Under anaerobic metabolism the respiratory quotient increases.
The venoarterial CO2 tension difference/arteriovenous O2 content
difference ratio [DPCO2/C(a-v)O2] therefore increases. We tested
the DPCO2/C(a-v)O2 ratio and mixed venous oxygen saturation
(SvO2) values as potential predictors of anaerobic metabolism.
Methods Fifty-one consecutive adult patients (head injury,
subarachnoid haemorrhage, sepsis) admitted to our ICU were
prospectively studied. The DPCO2/C(a-v)O2 ratio, SvO2, oxygen
delivery index (DO2I), and arterial lactate (Lac) values were
collected at T1 (ICU admission) and at T2 (after 24 hours). The
DO2I was calculated using the cardiac index (CI) measured by the
Pressure Recording Analytical Method (PRAM). PRAM is a pulse
contour system for beat-to-beat quantification of the CI. It does not
need calibrating factors, and allows the stroke volume (SV) to be
calculated avoiding the inaccuracies derived from instant variations
of arterial impedance. Radial (80%) or femoral (20%) arteries were
used for the blood pressure analysis. The presence of anaerobic
metabolism (e.g. hyperlactatemia, Lac+) was defined by an
increase in Lac >2 mmol/l. Linear correlations and the ROC test
were applied.
Results For a threshold value of DO2I > 330 ml/min/m2, an inverse
relationship (R2 = 0.69; P < 0.05) between Lac and SvO2 at T1
was found. For a DO2I < 330 ml/min/m2, good direct correlations

S137
between Lac and the DPCO2/Da-vO2 ratio calculated at T1 (R2 =
0.89; P < 0.05), and at T2 (R2 = 0.88; P < 0.05) were found. The
SvO2 did not show any significant relationship with Lac for a DO2I
< 330 ml/min/m2. ROC curves to predict Lac+ were constructed.
The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were 0.78 and 0.47 for
the DPCO2/Da-vO2 ratio and SvO2, respectively. The AUC for the
DPCO2/Da-vO2 ratio was significantly greater that that for SvO2
(P < 0.05). From the ROC curve an optimal cutoff value of 1.5
(sensitivity = 0.78, specificity = 0.75) was determined for the
DPCO2/Da-vO2 ratio predicting the presence of Lac+.
Conclusions Pulse wave analysis plays a key role in the continuous
monitoring of critically ill patients. It provides beat-to-beat values of
the SV, and consequently allows the DO2I to be frequently
calculated. The DPCO2/Da-vO2 ratio is simple and quick to calculate
and would be a valuable approach in clinical practice. Our findings
showed that DPCO2/Da-vO2 ratio values are directly related to Lac.
For DO2I < 330 ml/min/m2 the DPCO2/Da-vO2 ratio seems a more
reliable predictor of anaerobic metabolism than SvO2. Combined
gas exchange and pulse wave monitoring might be a very useful
approach to detect anaerobic metabolism in ICU patients.

Introduction Arterial finger blood pressure can be measured
continuously and non-invasively using the Finapres method. There
are numerous studies on the absolute blood pressure levels and
tracking of blood pressure changes in adults [1]. The accuracy and
precision of Finapres are according to the standards of the
Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation.
Recently BMEYE developed finger cuffs specifically designed for
the pediatric population. We present the first feasibility study
comparing the blood pressure measurements of a pediatric
prototype device (PFINAP) with intra-arterial blood pressure (IAP)
in critically ill children.
Methods Thirty-six mechanically ventilated and sedated children,
with a median age of 4 months (4 days–10 years) and a median
body weight of 5 kg (2–22 kg) were included. The IAP and
PFINAP were recorded simultaneously for a period of 10 min. Both
signals were stored with a 200 Hz sample rate. Standardized
intervals of 30 s were used for further analysis. The two methods
were compared using the Bland–Altman method.
Results One hundred and thirty-seven out of 144 non-invasive blood
pressure measurement (95%) signals were obtainable. The bias for
systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures was –15.9 mmHg
(SD 9.8), –8.0 mmHg (SD 5.9) and –10.5 mmHg (SD 5.6),
respectively (Fig. 1). Repeatability for the bias of MAP (1.96 × SD
of the difference between repeated measurements) was 6.9 mmHg.
The use of vasoactive drugs or a low temperature of the hand did
not influence the bias.
Conclusion The bias and precision found in this study are
comparable with the results of previous studies in adults. In adults,
accuracy and precision strongly improves after reconstruction of
finger blood pressure [2]. A similar software adjustment for the
pediatric population is under construction.

Introduction In the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock
inotropes, vasopressors and vasodilatation drugs are needed to
improve cardiac performance and microcirculation. The cardiac
output is used to measure the cardiac performance. Pulmonary
artery catheter (PAC)-based cardiac output measuring is often
used but major complications can occur. A cornerstone and also a
quality indicator of intensive care medicine is the prevention of
complications within the intensive care. Alternative methods to
measure cardiac output are developed to minimize complications.
Until now, every new introduced method has been shown to have
limitations. One of the latest alternatives is arterial pressure-based
cardiac output (APCO) measuring.
Objective To assess the usefulness of APCO in critically ill
patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
Methods Patients with severe sepsis or septic shock who needed
a PAC to guide therapy were connected to the APCO FlowTrac™
(Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). Data collected from the
APCO were evaluated and compared with the intermitted cardiac
output measurement using the PAC. Results of both observational
methods are compared using the Blend–Altman method.
Patients In this study the results of the first 10 patients are
analysed. The mean age is 72 years (36–86 years).
The mean APACHE II score is 23 (18–31). The severe sepsis
originated from the abdomen in five patients. The other five cases
originated from the lungs.
Results A total of 208 cardiac output measurements have been
obtained in critically ill patients of different origin. Comparing the
different cardiac output measurements in the individual patient, we
found a comparable trend in both methods. The presence of a
tricuspid and or mitral valve regurgitation should be known when
using the PAC-based cardiac output, especially when comparisons
are made. There is an interesting difference in subgroup analysis
when valvular abnormalities are considered. Significant differences
were found between patients with and without valvular
abnormalities (Mann–Whitney U test; P < 0.001). A moderate

correlation was seen for the group of patients with valvular
abnormalities between the magnitude of the cardiac output and the
size of the difference between monitoring methods (Pearson’s r =
0.53; P < 0.001), whereby bigger differences were found for
higher cardiac output volumes. Correcting for this output-size
effect, the difference between monitoring methods remained
significantly higher (mean diff.: 1.53; 95% limits of agreement:
–1.57 to 4.63) for patients with valvular abnormalities (Mann–
Whitney U test; P < 0.001).
Conclusion To us, the exact algorithm used by the APCO to
calculate the cardiac output is unknown. Nevertheless we find
comparable cardiac output measurements in patients with severe
sepsis and septic shock. Because of this we think there is a place
in clinical use of the APCO in the treatment of critically ill patients
with severe sepsis and septic shock. More research is needed to
fully understand the APCO and its implications.

The PAC remains in clinical use as a measure of CO and
haemodynamic trends, despite reports of inefficacy and patient
risk. The flow probe (FP) accurately measures flow but is restricted
to animal use by the necessity for surgical implantation. USCOM is
a novel non-invasive 2D independent CW Doppler device for
measurement of CO and haemodynamic change. We compared
the USCOM and PAC Baxter intermittent thermodilution (PAC)
with FP measurement of baseline CO and dobutamine-induced
changes in conscious sheep. FPs were implanted on the
ascending thoracic aorta of five sheep, and after 2 weeks recovery
a PAC was inserted. In conscious sheep, transcutaneous
transpulmonary USCOM signals were acquired and calibrated at
baseline to the FP as USCOM calculates flow volumes from a
human anthropometric algorithm. Simultaneous FP, USCOM and
PAC signals were acquired at baseline and after dobutamine (5,
10, 20 mg/hour), and stored to Spike 2 software while the Doppler
data were recorded on the USCOM device. Mean values for
baseline measures by FP (n = 862), by USCOM (n = 829) and by
PAC (n = 741) were 4.26 ± 0.67 l/min, 4.51 ± 0.90 l/min and
5.34 ± 1.26 l/min, respectively, increasing to 5.33 ± 1.55 l/min,
5.25 ± 1.45 l/min and 6.09 ± 1.61 l/min after dobutamine infusion.
The mean error between paired FP and USCOM measures at
baseline was 5.5%, and between FP and PAC was 20.4%, and
after dobutamine was 0.6% and 17.9%. For all measures FP and
USCOM showed good correlation (r = 0.745), while FP and PAC
were poorly correlated (r = 0.323).
USCOM may be a non-invasive alternative to PAC for
measurement and monitoring of haemodynamics in animals and
humans.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P331 (doi: 10.1186/cc4678)
Introduction In laparoscopy the pneumoperitoneum, increasing
intra-abdominal pressure, could impair cardiac performance and
determine adverse cardiopulmonary effects. We have assessed
the influence of laparoscopic surgery on selected hemodynamic–
volumetric parameters by the PiCCO device (pulse contour
analysis and transpulmonary technique).
Methods Under general anaesthesia 16 patients, age 62 ± 13
years, ASA II–III (exclusion criteria: cardiovascular disease,
neurological disease, pulmonary disease), nine male/seven female,
were enrolled in two groups: Group A eight patients submitted to
laparoscopic surgery; Group B, eight patients submitted to open
surgery. In this randomised, controlled study the cardiac index (CI),
global ejection fraction (GEF), mean arterial pressure (MAP),
systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), intrathoracic blood
volume (ITBVI), index of ventricular contractility (Dp/Dtmax) and
stroke volume index (SVI) were recorded. The hemodynamic and
volumetric data are studied at T0 (after induction of anaesthesia),
T1 (during pneumoperitoneum pressure at 12 ± 3 mmHg) and T2
(after deflation of the gas). Statistical analysis: ANOVA and
Bonferroni multiple comparisons post-test to compare changes in
the groups. All data are given as means ± SD and P < 0.05 is
considered statistically significant.
Results The hemodynamic parameters are not changed
significantly between groups and in each group except for SVRI
during pneumoperitoneum (P = 0.0077) (Table 1).

Introduction The aim of the study was to compare measurements
of cardiac index (CI) obtained with PiCCO (P) and LiDCO (L)
before and after fluid challenge (FC) in eight critically ill patients.
Methods We studied eight patients (seven males), aged 20–82
(49 ± 23) years, admitted to our ICU for head injury (four patients),
septic shock (one patient), ARDS (one patient), SAH (one patient),
PO NCH (one patient). The APACHE II score was 22–32
(27.75 ± 5.2), SAPS II was 44–77 (59.12 ± 11.4). They were all
monitored with P and L systems, to evaluate the CI, and received
FC to optimize fluid loading. Haemodynamic measurements were
made before and after FC with colloids (5 ml/kg in 30 min). Only
data of calibration provided from PiCCO and LiDCO measure-
ments were considered. Statistical analysis was performed with
correlation and the Bland and Altman test.
Results Twenty-two samples of data were collected. The CI P
range was 3.75–7.1 (4.4 ± 1.29) l/min/m2 before FC and
2.75–7.41 (4.94 ± 1.42) l/min/m2. The CI L before FC was
2.05–7.3 (4.4 ± 1.75) l/min/m2 and was 2.7–6.84 (4.56 ± 1.37)
l/min/m2 after FC. The correlation coefficient found is 0.823
(P < 0.001). The 95% CI was 0.6156–0.942. The overall mean
CO P – CO L difference was 0.19 l, with ±1.96 SD of –1.53 and
1.91 l, respectively. One measurement (4.5%) extended beyond
the lower SD limit.
Conclusion CI measurements obtained with the L system provided
acceptably comparable measurement with those of the P even if a
larger population study is needed to confirm these preliminary data.

Effects of midline thoracotomy on pulse pressure
variations during pressure-control ventilation

Objective During mechanical ventilation, the heart–lung interaction
induces a cyclic oscillation of the arterial pulse pressure. The measure
of this respiratory changes, called pulse pressure variation (PPV), is
one of the most reliable index of fluid responsiveness. It is used as a
functional hemodynamic monitoring in several conditions (general
anesthesia, sepsis, ALI/ARDS). During cardiac surgery, midline thora-
cotomy significantly alters heart–lung interaction and, consequently,
PPV. The aim of the study was the evaluation of the effects of
sternotomy on PPV during pressure-control ventilation (PCV).
Methods Nineteen patients (age 62 ± 10 years) undergoing elective
CABG in a tertiary university hospital were enrolled. A Swan–Ganz
catheter, an arterial catheter and a central venous catheter was
inserted in order to collect pressure waveforms. After the induction
of general anesthesia all the patients were mechanically ventilated
(PCV), setting pressure values in order to obtain a tidal volume of
8 ml/kg. Hemodynamic data were collected 5 min before and after
sternotomy. PPV was calculated offline from the collected wave-
forms, according to the formula reported by Michard and colleagues
[1].
Results The PPV, cardiac index, stroke volume, mean arterial
pressure, airway pressure and tidal volume did not change after
sternotomy. We subsequently differentiated patients according to
PPV values (Fig. 1). In the subgroup of patients with PPV > 13%
(7/19 patients), we found a good correlation between PPV and
Paw (Pearson correlation 0.861 P = 0.03; R2 = 0.74 P = 0.049);
after sternotomy, PPV was significantly reduced (15.4 ± 2.8% vs
8.2 ± 1.6%, P = 0.043) and it was no more correlated with Paw. In
the subgroup of patients with PPV < 13% (12/19 patients), we did
not find any correlation between PPV and Paw, and sternotomy
had no effects on hemodynamic data.
Conclusions During PCV, airway pressure affects PPV only when
patients are in a ‘fluid responsive’ status (PPV > 13%); similarly,
sternotomy reduces PPV only when baseline is above the thres-
hold value of 13%. It may thus be possible that midline thoraco-
tomy makes a ‘fluid responsive’ patient unresponsive to a fluid
challenge by leading his heart to work on the plateau portion of the
Frank–Starling curve. This hypothesis would be confirmed by the
lack of correlation between airway pressure and PPV after opening
the thorax.

has been proposed to identify responders to fluid administration.
Despite this, there are no data about the performance of dynamic
parameters during the use of different ventilatory settings in
normovolemia and hypovolemia.
Objectives To evaluate the influence of positive end expiratory
pressure (PEEP), tidal volume (VT) and inspiratory to expiratory ratio
(I:E) on the value of hemodynamic variables, including dPP, during
normovolemia and hypovolemia in pigs. To compare the ability of
hemodynamic variables (right atrial pressure [RAP], pulmonary
artery occluded pressure [PAOP], right ventricular end diastolic
volume [RVEDV], mixed venous oxygen saturation [SVO2] and dPP)
to identify hypovolemia during different ventilatory settings.
Methods Ten anaesthetized pigs (67 ± 3.5 kg) were mechanically
ventilated with VT 8 ml/kg, PEEP 5 cmH2O, I:E ratio 1:2 and
monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter for continuous cardiac
output, RVEDV and SVO2 measurement and a femoral artery
catheter for systemic blood pressure and dPP recording. Animals
were also ventilated in random order with VT 16 ml/kg, PEEP
15 cmH2O or I:E = 2:1 in normovolemia (PAOP 12–15 cmH2O),
after withdraw of 20% of animal estimated volemia (hypovolemia)
and after infusion of withdrawn blood (transfusion).
Results During normovolemia, use of PEEP 15 cmH2O decreased
the systolic volume (SV) (77.6 ± 23.5 vs 64.5 ± 16.4 ml, P < 0.05)
and SVO2 (78.8 ± 7.7 vs 67.4 ± 12.9%, P < 0.01), and increased
the RAP (10.5 ± 2.1 vs 13.4 ± 2.1 mmHg), PAOP (14.6 ± 1.6 vs
17.4 ± 1.7 mmHg, P < 0.001) and dPP (15.8 ± 8.5 vs 25.3 ±
9.5%, P < 0.001). VT 16 ml/kg caused an increase in dPP (15.8 ±
8.5 vs 31.6 ± 10.4%, P < 0.001) and I:E = 2:1 did not affect
hemodynamics. During hypovolemia, the high PEEP level affected
significantly all studied variables except RVEDV but dPP was
strongly influenced by high VT (40.5 ± 12.4% vs 84.2 ± 19.1%,
P < 0.001). During the transfusion phase, SV and SVO2 (P <
0.001) decreased with PEEP 15 cmH2O while RAP (P < 0,001),
PAOP (P < 0.05) and dPP (P < 0.001) increased their values; VT
16 ml/kg caused further increase of dPP from 10.6 ± 5.6 to 32.4 ±
8.6% (P < 0.001). ROC curves analysis showed that dPP, SVO2
and RVEDV were better indicators of hypovolemia in all ventilatory
settings with areas under the curve of 0.93, 0.91 and 0.87,
respectively.
Conclusions For the same volemic state, the results lead us to
conclude that: use of a high PEEP level causes increase of filling
pressures (RAP and PAOP), reduction of SVO2 and increase of
dPP; VT causes a great influence on the dPP value; and RVEDV is
the hemodynamic variable that is less influenced by ventilatory
settings. The dPP, SVO2 and RVEDV are better indicators of hypo-
volemia than RAP and PAOP independently of the ventilatory
settings.

Objective To investigate the precision and accuracy of continuous
pulse contour cardiac output (PCCO) and the partial carbon
dioxide rebreathing technique (NICO) under different levels of
positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).
Design A prospective, interventional study in the ICU of a
university hospital.
Participants Ten patients undergoing elective CABG surgery.
Methods After admission to the ICU each patient was ventilated
using one of three steps of PEEP for a time period of 30 min,
followed by a 15-min equilibration period. All three PEEP settings
were applied in randomly assigned order in every patient. A: PEEP
5 cmH2O; B: PEEP 10 cmH2O; C: PEEP 15 cmH2O. The ventilatory
settings were adjusted to achieve a tidal volume of 6–8 ml/kg/BW.
Hemodynamic measurements were performed in sequence every
3 min during the subsequent 30-min period. The cardiac output (CO)
was simultaneously measured using PCCO and NICO. At the end
of each 30-min period a bolus thermodilution-derived CO was
obtained from thermodilution curves detected in the femoral artery
(TPTDCO). Three intermittent consecutive boli consisting of 10 ml
ice-cold saline were randomly injected over the ventilatory cycle.
Results The comparison between the continuous cardiac output
measurement methods NICO vs PCCO showed a bias of 0.4 ±
1.02 l/min (bias ± SD), r = 0.58; between NICO vs TPTDCO 0.0 ±
1.22 l/min; r = 0.47; and between TPTDCO vs PCCO 0.24 ± 0.45
l/min; r = 0.93 at a PEEP level of 5 cmH2O. Mean bias at a PEEP
level of 10 cmH2O was 0.30 ± 1.17 l/min; r = 0.58; 0.1 ± 1.12
l/min; r = 0.59; 0.22 ± 0.61 l/min; r = 0.89, respectively. With
increasing PEEP to a level of 15 cmH2O the mean bias was NICO
vs PCCO 0.5 ± 1.37 l/min; r = 0.45; NICO vs TPTDCO 0.7 ±
1.37 l/min; r = 0.4; and TPTDCO vs PCCO –0.29 ± 0.99 l/min;
r = 0.92.
Conclusions The results of this clinical investigation show
agreement between TPTDCO and PCCO to satisfy clinical
requirements in a setting of postoperative patients after cardiac
surgery independent of the level of applied PEEP. In contrast, the
NICO monitor show agreement in clinical range until a PEEP level
of 10 cmH2O. With further increasing levels of PEEP the NICO
monitor is of limited use in these patients.

Stroke volume variation for assessment of the
responsiveness to volume loading in canines with
hemorrhagic shock: study on the comparison with
hemodynamic parameters
Q Haibo, S Liu
Nanjing Zhong-Da hospital, Nanjing, China
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P336 (doi: 10.1186/cc4683)
Objective To assess the significance of stroke volume variation
and intrathoracic blood volume index on the responsiveness to
volume loading in canines with hemorrhagic shock.
Methods Healthy mongrel canines were studied first to standardize
the modified Wiggers’ blood loss shock method. The MAP reached
50 mmHg and was maintained for 60 min. Graded volume loading
was performed with each volume loading step (VLS) consisting of 7
ml/kg Ringer’s given for 2 min. The same VLSs were preformed
after a period of 15 min of stability. Successive responsive VLSs
were performed (increase in SV >5% after VLS) until a continuous
change in SV <5% (nonresponsives) was reached. The values of
HR, MAP, CVP, PAWP, ITBI, and SVV were determined
immediately before and 5 min after volume loading. The responsives
and nonresponsives were identified as two groups.
Results (1) Responsive of VLS: 14 canines were studied and a
total of 134 VLSs were performed. In 94 VLSs, an increase in SV
of more than 5% was reached. In 40 VLSs, an increase in SV of
less than 5% was reached (nonresponsives). (2) Comparison
between the pre-VLS values of hemodynamic variables: the pre-
VLS values of MAP, ITBI (79.6 ± 27.6 mmHg, 569.9 ± 341.4
ml/m2) in responsives were less than nonresponsives (98.8 ± 15.2
mmHg, 784.2 ± 407.1 ml/m2). The pre-VLS values of SVV (14.5 ±
Critical Care March 2006 Vol 10 Suppl 1 26th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine

4.0%) in responsives were more than nonresponsives (9.0 ±
2.7%), (P < 0.05), but no difference occurred in the values of HR,
CVP, and PAWP. (3) Comparison between the change in the
values of hemodynamic variables after VLS: the values of HR, CVP,
PAWP, ITBI, and SVV in responsives differed from those of
nonresponsives (P < 0.05). (4) Correlation between the pre-VLS
values of hemodynamic variables and the change in SV after VLS
(delta SV): statistically significant correlations were found between
delta SV after VLS and the values of ITBI and SVV before fluid
loading (r = 0.356 and 0.531, respectively) (P < 0.05). No corre-
lation was found between delta SV and the value of HR, MAP,
CVP, and PAWP before fluid loading (P > 0.05). (5) Correlation
between the pre-VLS values of hemodynamic variables and delta
SV: statistically significant correlations were also found between
delta SV and delta CVP, delta PAWP, delta ITBI, and delta SVV
after fluid loading (r = –0.371, –0.448, 0.438 and –0.376,
respectively) (P < 0.05). (6) Assessment of the volume: using
ROC analysis, the area under the curve for SVV was 0.872, and
ITBI was 0.689, statistically more than those of HR, MAP, CVP,
and PAWP. A SVV value of 9.5% or more will predict an increase
in the SV of at least 5% in response to a VLS with a sensitivity of
92.6% and a specificity of 62.5%.
Conclusion Assessment of SVV and ITBI on the responsiveness to
volume loading were more useful indicators than HR, MAP, CVP,
and PAWP. It as a functional preload parameter and, for online
monitoring, may help to improve the hemodynamic management.

Medical University of Vienna, Austria
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P337 (doi: 10.1186/cc4684)
Introduction Determination and possibly monitoring of cardiac
output (CO) is essential in cardiogenic shock (CS) and low-output
heart failure (HF). The value of pulse contour analysis in these
patients is unknown.
Hypothesis The aim of the present study was to assess the
feasibility of LiDCO-pulse contour analysis in patients with CS and
HF and to compare LiDCO with the standard pulmonary artery
catheter (PAC).
Methods A total of 27 patients (17 male, age 62 ± 13 years,
SAPS II 52 ± 19; mechanical ventilation n = 24; CS and HF,
group 1, n = 14; control, group 2, n = 13) and a total of 72
measurements were included (a mean of 2.17 consecutive
measurements/patient). The CO was measured using PAC and
LiDCO simultaneously in all patients. The LiDCO was calibrated
according to the manufacturer.
Results CO-PAC and CO-LiDCO showed a significant correlation
(r = 0.66, P = 0.001) for the group as a whole. The correlation was
lower in group 1 (r = 0.45, P = 0.004) vs group 2 (r = 0.58,
P = 0.001). There was good agreement between the two methods
for the entire group (mean difference 0.086, 95% CI –0.29 to
0.47). Respective values were 0.08 (95% CI –0.37 to 0.54) for
group 1 and 0.09 (95% CI –0.58 to 0.7) for group 2.
Conclusion There was a somewhat lower correlation between
CO-PAC and CO-LiDCO in patients with CS and HF when
compared with controls. From a clinical standpoint, agreement
between the two methods was fairly good.

Introduction Passive leg rising is proved to be a predictive tool of
fluid challenge in the ventilated patient. Pulse contour analysis
remains an innovative technique, so there are many dark sides to
explore in usual clinical practice.
Objective To evaluate the PiCCO parameter responses to the
passive leg rising position in ICU patients.
Patients and methods All patients with PICCO monitoring under
mechanical ventilation and deeply sedated were enrolled. When
physicians needed fluid challenge, we noted parameters delivered
beat to beat (Philipps Monitor), heart rate (HR), systolic arterial
pressure (SAP), diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), continuous
cardiac index (CCI) and stroke volume variation (SVV), in the
supine position (SP), then at 1 and 5 min in the Tredelembourg
position (TP) (bed at 45°, patient position unchanged on bed), then
in the supine position and after 200 ml gelatine fluid challenge.
Results We analysed nine measures in three ICU patients with
septic shock: two received norepinephrine and one epinephrine as
amine support. All patients were mechanically ventilated and
deeply sedated. The TP leads to a decrease in HR, an increase in

arterial pressure, a decrease in SVV, without any effect on the
pulse contour cardiac index. Fluid loading increases arterial
pressure but decreases the HR and SVV (Table 1).
Conclusion The TP mimics the effect of fluid loading. PiCCO
parameters, especially SVV, can detect changes induced by the TP.

Introduction The specific interactions of the lungs and the cardio-
vascular system under mechanical ventilation cause cyclic variations
of left ventricular stroke volume (SVV). Real-time measurement of
SVV using arterial pulse contour analysis is useful to predict
volume responsiveness and to monitor volume therapy in mechani-
cally ventilated patients. In this study, SVV was evaluated using
simultaneous recordings with the LiDCO plus system (LiDCO Ltd.
Cambridge, UK) and the Vigileo (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA,
USA) cardiac output monitor.
Methods At baseline the LiDCO pulse contour cardiac output was
calibrated using the bolus thermodilution technique. The setup and
zeroing procedure of the Vigileo cardiac output monitor was
carried out in compliance with product specifications. Nine
postoperative cardiac surgical patients were included. All
measurements were carried out during standard clinical care. In
stable clinical conditions, changes in SVV were forced by changes
in tidal volume (Vt), the level of PEEP and leg-raising procedures.
In all patients a total of 134 data pairs were evaluated using linear
regression and Bland–Altman statistics.
Results The mean SVV measured with LiDCO was 10.1 ± 5.3%
(SD), and that measured with the Vigileo was 11.7 ± 5.9%. The
correlation coefficient regarding SVV measured with the two different
devices was R2 = 0.678 (slope 0.944, SE 0.057) (Fig. 1). The
computed bias was significantly different from 0 (–1.70 ± 3.3%, P <
0.001) (95% CI –2.28 to –1.13). The upper and lower limits of
agreement were 5.01 and –8.42% (Fig. 2). The calculated agreement
between negative and positive changes in SVV using the LiDCO plus
system and the Vigileo cardiac output monitor was correct in 80.6%.
Conclusions The agreement in SVV measured with the LiDCO
and Vigileo cardiac output computer is acceptable. We found a
slight, but significant, difference in SVV between the LiDCO and
Vigileo cardiac output monitoring systems. For adequate
interpretation of differences of SVV, more disclosure of the used
mathematical models is essential.

Introduction Less invasive measurement of central venous O2
saturation (ScvO2) has shown to be a valuable alternative to the
determination of mixed venous O2 saturation for monitoring of O2
supply/demand [1,2]. The aim of this study was to compare ScvO2
measured continuously by the new CeVOX (Pulsion Medical
System, Munich, Germany) device (CScvO2) with ScvO2
determined by blood gas co-oximetry (BScvO2).
Methods Ten ASA III patients undergoing elective off-pump
coronary artery bypass grafting were studied during the operation
(OP) and during their ICU stay. In addition to the standard
hemodynamic monitoring according to institutional policy, a
CeVOX fiber-optic probe was introduced into a standard central
venous catheter placed via internal jugular vein access. OP and
ICU measurement started after in-vivo calibration of CeVOX.
BScvO2 and CScvO2 readings were recorded at intervals of
30 min during OP and of 120 min during ICU. Data were
statistically analyzed using Bland–Altman analysis, Pearson
correlation and t test for the periods during OP, ICU, a set of three
consecutive measurements during OP immediately after calibration
(OPcal) and 4 hours later (OP4 h) as well as immediately after
calibration on the ICU (ICUcal) and 14 hours later (ICU14 h). Trend
analysis was performed, calculating differences (∆) between
consecutive measurements. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results One hundred and twenty-nine matched sets of data were
obtained (OP: n = 78, ICU: n = 51) with a wide range of ScvO2
values (BScvO2 = 48.0–91.0%, CScvO2 = 49.0–94.0%). The OP
observation time was 4.0–6.5 hours and the ICU measurement
sequence was 14.0–20.0 hours. Bland–Altman analysis revealed
an overall mean bias ± 2SD (limits of agreement) of –0.7 ± 7.8%

for CScvO2 – BScvO2 during OP and –1.1 ± 11.6% during ICU
(Fig. 1). There was no significant difference between CScvO2 and
BScvO2 (OP: P = 0.120, ICU: P = 0.167). The correlation coefficient
(r2) for CScvO2 vs BScvO2 was 0.885 (OP) and 0.592 (ICU).
Statistics for OPcal, OP4 h and ICUcal were comparable, whereas for
ICU14 h the bias ± 2SD increased and r2 decreased (Table 1). Trend
analysis showed no significant difference (OP: ∆BScvO2 = –1.3 ±
9.0%, ∆CScvO2 = –1.1 ± 8.6%, P = 0.663; ICU: ∆BScvO2 =
–0.4 ± 6.8%, ∆BScvO2 = –0.4 ± 5.8%, P = 0.828).
Conclusions These preliminary results indicate that ScvO2 can be
reliably assessed by CeVOX. Scheduled recalibration at intervals
<14 hours may be mandatory.

Noninvasive approach to follow-up hemodynamics in
patients with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation:
expediency and value

Introduction Evaluation of hemodynamics in patients with
complicated acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is crucial. Intra-
aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABC) in patients with AMI
complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS) is supposed to be
monitored exclusively by invasive methods for assessment of
hemodynamics. However, noninvasive methods might have a place
in monitoring these patients.
Objective To evaluate hemodynamic indices (HI) by intermittent
thermodilution (ITD) in patients with AMI, complicated by CS
managed with IABC, and to compare with HI evaluated by
continuous impedance cardiography (ICG).
Methods Cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were
measured by both ITD and ICG methods for patients with AMI
complicated by CS, admitted within 12 hours from the onset of
pain and managed by IABC. The standard eight-electrode ICG
registration was used. The average values of COICG and SVICG
derived from the last 10 min of the ICG record (60 SV
instantaneous readings) were used to compare the results of ITD.
Fourteen patients were investigated according to the study
protocol, eight (57.1%) men and six (42.9%) women. The average
age was 72.8 ± 6.9 years. Anterior AMI was diagnosed for nine
(64.3%) patients, inferior for four (28.6%), circular for one (7.1%)
patient. Primary PTCA was successfully performed for seven
(50%) patients, six (42.9%) underwent cardiac surgery within the
first 2 weeks, and primary PTCA was unsuccessful for one (7.1%)
patient, who died within the first 18 hours. The mortality rate was
78.6% (11 patients).
Results The measured COITD ranged from 2.8 ± 1.3 to 3.9 ± 1.1
l/min, SVITD from 26.8 ± 8.2 to 34.4 ± 10.8 ml. While the COICG
ranged from 4.2 ± 1.4 to 4.9 ± 2.2 l/min, the SVICG ranged from
40.4 ± 14.2 to 51.4 ± 12.1 ml. The correlation coefficient (CF)
was calculated comparing CO values derived from ICG and ITD; it
ranged from 0.24 to 0.98 in separate patients. A weak correlation
of ICG and ITD measurements was observed before initiation of
IABC — 0.24–0.27 in separate cases. CF improved during IABC
(0.58–0.98) and at the termination of IABC (0.67–0.97). The
observed correlation was more pronounced in patients without a
high dose of inotropes and ranged 0.58–0.98 while for patients
with a high dose of inotropes it was less pronounced (0.29–0.5).
Conclusion Significant correlation of SV was observed between
the ICG and ITD methods during IABC. However, higher values of
CO and SV were measured by ICG. Non-invasive evaluation of
hemodynamic indices by continuous monitoring of ICG during AMI,
complicated by CS and managed by IABC, is a reliable method for
further application. The correlation of hemodynamic parameters
measured by two methods was more pronounced in patients
without a high dose of inotropes.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P342 (doi: 10.1186/cc4689)
Introduction Most clinical studies have so far focused on the
regional effects of epinephrine (i.e. hepato-splanchnic blood flow)
in septic patients. In cardiac surgical patients, however, inotropic
(i.e. epinephrine) support is often necessary for optimizing cardiac
output postoperatively. We tested whether increasing cardiac
output by epinephrine leads to an improved regional (i.e. hepato-
splanchnic) blood flow and function.
Methods After approval by our ethics committee and written
consent, we postoperatively studied 12 patients (mean age 71 ± 8
years) with elective coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 2) or aortic

valve replacement (n = 10). All patients had a reduced left
ventricular function and underwent extended hemodynamic
monitoring by a pulmonary artery (CCO-PAC) for clinical
indication. Microcirculation within the splanchnic area was
assessed by gastric tonometry, liver blood flow and function non-
invasively by transcutaneous measurement of the ICG-PDR. Since
fluid loading led to no increase in cardiac output, patients were
considered nonfluid responsive. Measurements were made on ICU
admission and after 1 hour of epinephrine treatment. The mean
epinephrine dosage was changed from 0.02 to 0.08 µg/kg/min. All
patients were on pressure-controlled mechanical ventilation and
respirator settings remained unchanged throughout the study
period. Data are the mean ± SD. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results The heart rate significantly increased from 97 ± 11 to
106 ± 12/min. Central venous (10 ± 3 vs 10 ± 4 mmHg) and left
atrial (10 ± 5 vs 11 ± 5 mmHg) pressures were unchanged. The
cardiac index and stroke volume index significantly increased from
2.7 ± 0.5 to 3.2 ± 0.5 l/min/m2 and from 28 ± 6 to 31 ± 5 ml/m2.
Although systemic O2 delivery and O2 consumption significantly
increased, the ICG-PDR did not change significantly (i.e. from
18.0 ± 5.6 to 19.5 ± 6.4%/min). The gastric mucosal PCO2 and
the PCO2 gap (difference between regional and end-tidal PCO2)
significantly increased from 5.4 ± 1.0 to 5.9 ± 1.1 kPa and from
1.2 ± 0.8 to 1.5 ± 0.7 kPa, respectively.
Conclusion Increasing cardiac output by epinephrine was
associated with no change in the ICG-PDR but with a significant
deterioration in gastric mucosal blood flow in patients after cardiac
surgery.

Cardiac output measurement in preterm neonates:
validation of USCOM against echocardiography

Objective measurement of cardiac output (CO) in preterm neonates
is important for optimisation of haemodynamic management, and
may have outcome benefits. Doppler ultrasound is the preferred
method for measurement of CO; however, the pulmonary and aortic
diameters for calculating flow volumes are small, and measurement
using 2D ultrasound requires expertise and experience, particularly
for analysis of transpulmonary flow. The USCOM (USCOM Ltd,
Sydney, Australia) is a novel 2D independent device using CW
Doppler and anthropometrics to determine both right and left flow
volumes. The device is simpler to operate and less expensive than
the conventional echocardiography.
This study was to compare 2D echo and USCOM CO
measurements in preterm neonates.
After IRB approval 66 paired measures of transpulmonary CO
were acquired in 37 preterm neonates (mean weight 1.13 ± 0.47
kg) using conventional echocardiography, combining 2D and CW
Doppler, and the USCOM device. Signals were acquired and
analysed independently and in a blinded fashion, and values
compared by two-tailed t tests and Bland–Altman bias analysis.
Mean values of transpulmonary CO were 0.36 ± 0.19 l/min by
echocardiography and 0.37 ± 0.14 l/min by USCOM and were not
significantly different (r = 0.9134, P < 0.005). The mean difference
between measures was 0.00 ± 0.08 l/min, with a mean of the
means of 0.36 ± 0.16 l/min and a mean percentage error of
–3.7%. The smaller SDs associated with USCOM convert to
smaller 95% CIs and a possible increased sensitivity for detection
of haemodynamic change.
These results suggest that the USCOM is as accurate for
measurement of neonatal CO as conventional echocardiography,
and may be a simple cost-effective alternative for neonatal
haemodynamic management.

A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common clinical finding and is
becoming increasingly implicated in several important
pathophysiological conditions, including cryptogenic embolic stroke,
migraine with aura, decompression sickness and, more rarely, acute
myocardial infarction [1]. Echocardiographic techniques are the
principal means for diagnosis and assessment of a PFO [2]. The
development of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with harmonic
imaging coupled with the use of contrast and provocation testing has
potentially enhanced our ability to detect a PFO transthoracically.
Methods A total of 20 patients with an unexplained embolic event
were recruited. We compared four routes of contrast delivery
(upper extremity vein in a dependent position, upper extremity vein
in an elevated position, right femoral vein and lower extremity vein)
with provocation manoeuvres on the detection of PFO using both
TTE and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). The route of
contrast delivery was performed in a random fashion. Studies were
interpreted in real time by an echocardiographer in an unblinded
manner as in real-life clinical practice. All studies were digitally
recorded and later reviewed independently by a second BSE-
accredited echocardiographer blinded to the sequence and site of
contrast injections.
Results The mean age of the 20 patients was 24 ± 10.7 years and
12 (60%) were male. All patients were in sinus rhythm. Six patients

(30%) were exsmokers and four (20%) current smokers. Two
patients were on treatment for hypertension and five (25%)
patients had hyperlipidaemia (total cholesterol >5 mmol/l). One
patient suffered with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of
PFO detected by the TTE approach combined with a provocation
manoeuvre was 50% (10/20). The prevalence in divers was 100%
(5/5) and 38% (5/13) in patients with a cryptogenic stroke/TIA.
TOE only detected 5/20 (25%) PFOs. All PFOs detected by TOE
were detected by TTE. Valsalva improved the detection rate for all
routes of contrast delivery except i.v. access at the ankle. The
highest detection rates were seen with contrast injection in the
elevated arm or via the right femoral venous route (10/20).
Agreement between reviewers was excellent (P < 0.01). All non-
agreement observed between TTE and TOE occurred when TTE
reported a positive result and TOE a negative result. In 9/10 (90%)
cases the clearest image was using TTE, with 7/9 (78%) following
a provocation manoeuvre. Left ventricular opacification was most
marked during femoral vein delivery of the contrast agent coupled
with the valsalva manoeuvre and TTE.
Conclusion TTE with harmonic imaging and femoral vein delivery
of contrast should be regarded as the gold standard for the
echocardiographic detection of PFO. Maximising the contrast load
by use of the large antecubital vein and arm elevation improves
detection if arm injection is used.

Introduction The assessment of right ventricular (RV) function is
difficult because of its complex geometry, its dependence on the
load conditions and the absence of normal physiological values.
Longitudinal shortening, the main component of its ‘systolic
function’, can be studied by Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) of the
tricuspid valve annular at the RV free wall, which analyses the
longitudinal component of the RV ‘function’.
Objective To estimate the ability of the tricuspid valve annular DTI
to diagnose a RV dysfunction.
Patients and methods Forty intensive care patients without any
cardiopulmonary pathology underwent an echographic exploration
with DTI and form the reference group. This group allows one to
test the feasibility of the technique and to confirm the normal
values suggested by the literature. Forty-five other patients with a
RV dysfunction attested by a dilation of the right ventricle, a RV/LV
ratio >0.6, a dilation of the VCI without respiratory variation and the
presence of pulmonary hypertension more than 45 mmHg
underwent the same echo-Doppler study. Parameters obtained
from DTI are: the systolic peak velocity (Stric) and the velocity time
integral (VTITric) of the annular tricuspid free wall side.
Results The feasibility of the method is excellent, since all the
patients could be analyzed. The reference group presents values
that are in conformity with the data of the literature: Stric = 15.8 ±
5.45 cm/s and VTItric = 2.76 ± 0.48 cm, which correlated well
together (r = 0.81, P < 0.001). The values of the RV dysfunction
group are different: Stric = 8.87 ± 2.22 cm/s and VTItric = 1.33 ±
0.39 cm but correlated well together (r = 0.82, P < 0.001).
Threshold values of Stric < 12 cm/s and VTIStric < 2 cm diagnose
a RV dysfunction with, respectively, a sensitivity of 92% and 97%
and a specificity of 95% and 96%.
On the other hand there is no correlation between these two
parameters and the RV shortening fraction measured by echography
or the pulmonary artery pressure attested by conventional Doppler.
This underlines the difficulties to analyse the RV function with the
conventional tools.
Conclusion Recording the tricuspid annular velocity by pulsed-
wave DTI at the free wall is easy and very simple. These
parameters would allow one to diagnose early systolic RV
dysfunction, a frequently underestimated pathology among patients
with aggressive ventilation.

Introduction Transesophageal Doppler (TED) increases prognosis
in perioperative time [1] by detecting cardiac output (CO)
variations [2]. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is
progressively considered as an alternative to the pulmonary artery
catheter in the ICU. The purpose of this study is to compare
cardiac output measurement using two ultrasound-based
technologies: TED vs TEE.
Methods Twenty-one ventilated patients in septic shock were
enrolled in two ICU units. The CO was recorded successively with
TEE (COTEE) (Toshiba) and with TED (COTED) (Hemosonic 100
Arrow® and DOPTEK-ODM®) at the initial phase of septic shock.
COTEE was obtained by measurement of the aortic velocity
(ITVAo) in the transgastric view and by measurement of the aortic
area in the transesophageal view (CSA): CSA × ITVAo × HR. An
average of three measurements was recorded for each technique.
A Bland–Altman study was used to compare the two techniques.
Results Bad correlation was found between the two ultrasound-
based technologies (correlation coefficient = 0.09; P = NS) with
an overestimation of COTED on COTEE of 1.4 ± 5.4 l/min. These
differences were found with the two Doppler types used.
Conclusion Comparison of two non-invasive techniques to obtain
CO output proves a low correlation between absolute value measure-
ments of CO. Even though prolonged use is possible with TED, the
absolute values obtained with TED have to be carefully interpreted.

Cardiac pump performance in patients who underwent
coronary artery bypass grafting

Introduction The measure of ventricular performance, as an
independent parameter of cardiovascular function, must be
performed by a beat-to beat assessment of systolic function
independent of load conditions, and is useful both as an index of
contractility and as an index of ventricular functional reserve. We
analyzed three different parameters of ventricular performance: the
preload adjusted peak power (PAPP) [1], as an index of
contractility; the cardiac cycle efficiency (CCE) [2], as a measure
of ventricular arterial coupling; and the ejection fraction (EF), as an
index of global ventricular function.
Materials and methods Fourteen patients who had undergone
elective coronary artery bypass grafting were studied during the
operation. All patients had preoperative EF >35%, good function
of the cardiac valve and no contraindication to transoesophageal
echocardiography (TEE). The arterial pressure was connected to a
Pressure Record Analytical Method (PRAM) monitor to continuous
measure the stroke volume index (SVI), cardiac cycle efficiency
(CCE), and stroke volume variation (SVV) by pressure wave
analysis. All the TEE examinations were obtained with a multiplane
transesophageal probe (5-MHz probe). PAPP was obtained by the
product of the peak systolic aortic pressure and the peak velocity
of the aortic blood flow. EF was estimated from the end-diastolic
and end-systolic area in the mid-papillary transgastric view. The
parameters from PRAM and TEE were recorded simultaneously,
and were performed during apnoea, after induction of anaesthesia,
and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In eight patients
dobutamine 2.5 µg/kg/min was infused before CPB to assess
ventricular reserve.
Results No significant difference was found between preoperative
and postoperative hemodynamic data. There was a good
correlation found between PAPPpre vs CCEpre (R 20.80; P <
0.001), PAPPpre vs SVIpre (R 20.95; P < 0.001) and PAPPpre vs
EFpre (R 20.92; P < 0.001). The same good correlation was found
for postoperative data between PAPPpost vs CCEpost (R2 0.94;
P < 0.001), PAPPpost vs SVIpost (R2 0.95; P < 0.01) and
PAPPpost vs EFpost (R2 0.90; P < 0.001). There was an improve-
ment of the PAPP value after infusion of dobutamine (2.4 ± 0.9 vs
3.2 ± 0.8) in all eight patients where it was made, but the small
samples did not allow statistical analysis in this preliminary study.
Conclusion The PAPP, CCE and the EF could be used to assess
ventricular and ventricular–arterial performance in clinical practice
by the new low-invasive monitoring systems.

Incidence and efficacy of pulmonary artery catheters in the
ICU of a developing country: a prospective, controlled study

Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P348 (doi: 10.1186/cc4695)
Background Existing randomized controlled trials on pulmonary
artery catheter (PAC)-guided strategies reveal a modest risk
reduction that does reach statistical significance. Risk reduction
appears to be greatest in surgical series. This is primarily inserted
for patients with systemic shock requiring haemodynamic support.
However the efficacy of data collected from its use and the cost–
benefit ratio are debatable. We would like to propose a study to
look at the following objectives in the setting of a Third-World
country ICU.
Objectives The incidence, indications, complication rate and
outcome of PAC use in our ICU over a period of 3 months,
comparing cases with matched controls.
Design An observational, prospective, controlled study in the ICU
of a tertiary care university hospital serving an urban population of
a Third-World country with limited resources.
Methods Over a period of 3 months every patient admitted to the
ICU who had a PAC inserted for any indication was included. An
equal number of patients matched for age and diagnosis but
without a PAC were used as controls. Sample size calculation: as
we do not have an incidence of PAC use available for our ICU as
yet, a sample size calculation was not possible; however, we
propose to study the incidence as well as indications and outcome
by carrying out this study over 3 months. Data collection was
carried out by the first author and an ICU resident. The data were
collected by means of a data collection form.
Results and conclusion Fourteen patients and controls were
enrolled in the study. The incidence of PAC use was 19% of all
ICU admissions. Statistical analysis using Fisher’s exact test and
Student’s t test revealed a P value of 0.677 for outcome with a
nonsignificant difference between the two groups; a P value of
0.003 for length of stay, proving a significant difference between
the two groups; and a P value of 0.455 (nonsignificant) for the
mean age of patients with PACs. Pneumonia and sepsis were two
of the leading causes for ICU admission; while ‘fluid management’
and ‘haemodynamic monitoring’ were two leading indications for
PAC insertion. There were complications present in 30% of the

patients, including line sepsis, balloon rupture and coiling. Cost
analysis showed a total cost of Rs.16,532/per patient for PAC
insertion and monitoring. Despite being a limited study, we can
clearly see that the cost effectiveness and outcome of patients
with the PAC seems ambiguous. In a developing country where
resources are limited, thought must be given to the risk and benefit
ratio of placing this invasive monitor and the use of the information
provided properly justified.

Hemodynamic monitoring in severe sepsis and septic
shock in German ICUs
U Jaschinski1, C Engel2

Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P349 (doi: 10.1186/cc4696)
The first-line therapy in severe sepsis and septic shock is volume
resuscitation, since relative and absolute hypovolemia are key
symptoms of this illness. In addition a small subset of patients
present with a septic cardiomyopathy (10–15%), a type of heart
failure that barely responds to inotropes. Rapid restoration of blood
flow and of tissue oxygenation respectively is of utmost importance
in order to prevent organ dysfunction. So it is reasonable to
postulate hemodynamic monitoring to diagnose pathophysiologic
features and to guide therapy in these severely ill patients; more so
since it has been shown recently that a substantial reduction in
mortality could be achieved following therapeutic goals [1].
The objective of the study was to evaluate monitoring habits in
German ICUs in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.
A prospective observational cross-sectional study was performed
in the ICUs of a representative hospital sample randomly selected
from a complete registry of German hospitals stratified by size
(≤200; 201–400; 401–600; >600 beds; university hospitals).
From a total of 3877 patients screened, 415 patients (11%)
fulfilled the ACCP/SCCM criteria for severe sepsis or septic
shock. In these patients, monitoring routines – arterial blood
pressure (ABP), central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery
catheter (PAC) and pulse contour analysis (PCA) – were
ascertained by physicians trained in critical care medicine and
compared with the data of a questionnaire that had been answered
by the director of the ICU.
In general there was a pronounced difference between the
statements of the ICU directors answering the questionnaire and
the monitoring devices actually used. Only CVP measurement had
been performed in all ICU patients in all hospital strata, and there
was no gap between the questionnaire and instituted device.
Patients in hospitals >400 beds were monitored with invasive ABP
measurement in the majority of all cases, while middle-sized
hospitals did this less frequently (60–75%). The PAC had been
used in only a small subset of patients (<12%), although especially
in larger hospitals the ICU director stated to use it more frequently
(university: 40.4%). PCA, an excellent device to guide volume
resuscitation [2], had seldom been in use as well. Even in major
hospitals less than 15% of all patients monitored their patients in
this way.

Setting The general ICU of Hyllel Yaffe Medical Center, Israel.
Objective End tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) monitoring is a non-
invasive way to estimate blood carbon dioxide (PCO2). The
purpose of this study was to determine whether ETCO2 measure-
ment reliably indicates PCO2 in mechanically ventilated patients
and analyses the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
on volumetric capnography and respiratory system mechanics in
mechanically ventilated patients.
Methods Twenty normal subjects (control group) and 20 patients
with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS group) were
studied. Respiratory system mechanics — compliance and Bohr’s
dead space (physiologic dead space to tidal volume ratio
[VD/VT(Bohr)]) — at different levels of PEEP were measured.
ETCO2 and carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) measure-
ments were recorded. ETCO2 was measured using a mainstream
ETCO2 monitor by Mannen Medical. All patients were ventilated
with a Dreger Evita2 ventilator. Demographic data and primary
diagnosis were recorded. Linear regression was used to analyze
ETCO2/PCO2 pairs. Statistical significance was considered
P < 0.05.
Results See Table 1. The mean dead-space fraction was markedly
elevated (0.58 ± 0.01) at PEEP 11 cmH2O and 0.66 ± 0.02 at
PEEP 15 cmH2O early in the course of ARDS. Large differences
were found between PaCO2 and mixed expired carbon dioxide
(PETCO2) in ARDS patients. The difference between arterial and
end-tidal PCO2 correlated closely with VD/VT.
Conclusions Our studies confirm that PETCO2 is a poor estimate
of PaCO2 in patients with respiratory failure in PEEP values greater
than 11 cmH2O. Furthermore, the PaCO2–PETCO2 gradient is not
stable over time and cannot predict variations of PaCO2. The use
of PETCO2 instead of PaCO2 could be deleterious in patients in
whom strict control of PaCO2 values is required.

Tissue perfusion may be assessed at the bedside with
ETCO2-derived dead-space estimation

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P351 (doi: 10.1186/cc4698)
Introduction Alveolar dead space is determined by the degree of
ventilation/perfusion mismatch in the lung. Since the entire cardiac
output must pass through the lungs, we hypothesized that global
changes in perfusion would correlate with changes in alveolar
dead space. Dead space (VD/VT) can be estimated from the
modified Bohr equation, which is further modified by substituting
end-tidal CO2 for PECO2 — hence the VDVTest (estimated dead
space). We used blood lactate as the endpoint of resuscitation.
Methods Five mechanically ventilated patients with lactic acidosis
(lactate >30 mg/dl) were included. Four patients were postlaparo-
tomy, one had multiple trauma. Ages were 36–87 years, APACHE II
scores 18–37, and P:F ratio 203–470. We recorded the HR, MAP,
CVP and ETCO2 from the ICU monitor. We took simultaneous
arterial and central venous blood samples at 30-min intervals for the
first 4 hours of the study, then every 1 hour for a total of 12 hours.
Results There was a strongly positive linear trend correlating the
VDVTest with lactate levels [r(76) = 0.800; P < 0.001] (Fig. 1).
Furthermore, when plotted against time, the trends in VDVTest and
lactate are parallel (example data from study patient 1 are shown;
Fig. 2). There was also a significant correlation between the arterial
to end-tidal CO2 gradient (PaCO2–PETCO2) and lactate levels
[r(76) = 0.730, P < 0.001]. There was no meaningful correlation
between blood lactate and MAP, CVP, ScvO2 and O2ER.
Conclusion In this pilot study we demonstrated linear correlation
between estimated dead-space and lactic acid levels. We propose
that this technique may be a useful end-point of resuscitation
during shock. It is convenient to measure, requires no special
equipment and is non-invasive. Further study is required to assess
the technique’s reliability across different patient populations.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P352 (doi: 10.1186/cc4699)
Background and objectives The hallmark of both systemic
inflammation response syndrome (SIRS) and acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) is increased capillary permeability,
which manifests itself in the lungs as altered alveolar–capillary
barrier function and is characterised by accumulation of
extravascular lung water (EVLW). It is known that EVLW estimated
by transpulmonary single thermodilution correlates closely with
gravimetric measurements in experiments on animal studies. The
correlation in human beings, however, is uncertain. Furthermore,
the pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) in patients with
SIRS and ARDS has never been investigated in the literature. The
aims of our study were: to evaluate whether PVPI may be an
indicator of systemic inflammation disease and the severity of lung
injury; and to compare the postmortem lung weight and EVLW
measured by transpulmonary single thermodilution.
Materials and methods The PiCCO system (PULSION, Munich,
Germany) data from 41 patients (APACHE II score 25 ± 7.5)
treated in three hospitals between July 2004 and September 2005
was analysed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two
groups. The first included patients who met the criteria of SIRS
and the latter did not (SIRS vs non-SIRS). The SIRS groups was
further subdivided into two; SIRS with ARDS, and SIRS without
ARDS. We also considered four patients upon whom autopsies
were carried out within 15 hours after the thermodilution EVLW
measurement was performed.
Results The PVPI was significantly higher in the SIRS group
(n = 31) than the non-SIRS group (n = 10) (SIRS vs non-SIRS:
2.37 ± 1.0 vs 1.2 ± 0.21; P = 0.0013). The PVPI was highest in
the SIRS with ARDS group (n = 13) and lowest in the non-SIRS
group (P < 0.001). Moreover, the PVPI was higher in the SIRS
with ARDS group than the SIRS without ARDS group (n = 18)
(non-SIRS vs SIRS with ARDS vs SIRS without ARDS: 1.2 ± 0.21
vs 1.7 ± 0.44 vs 3.2 ± 1.10). There was a very close relationship
between transpulmonary thermodilution and postmortem lung
weight (n = 4, R = 0.985; P = 0.0015)
Conclusion Measurement of extravascular lung water using the
PiCCO system is very closely correlated with the gravimetric
measurement of lung weight. The PVPI may increase due to
systemic inflammation. This increase of PVPI may represent
subclinical lung injury, which is undetectable by other bedside
monitors or clinical examination.

ICU, Lisbon, Portugal
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P353 (doi: 10.1186/cc4700)
Objective To compare central venous pressure (CVP)
measurements obtained in two different locations (jugular or
subclavian veins and femoral veins).
Setting A 16-bed medical–surgical ICU.
Materials and methods The patients enrolled had central venous
catheters (CVC) in two different locations, one placed in the
internal jugular or subclavian veins and a second in a femoral vein.
Simultaneous measurements of CVP were undertaken by two
different operators, with a pressure transducer zero-referenced at
the mid-chest. Standard CVC with similar features (20 cm length)
were used. Patients with intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) >15 mmHg
were excluded. The IAP was previously evaluated in all patients
using the method described by Sugrue and Hillman. A linear
correlation analysis was performed, considering significant
P > 0.05 and a correlation coefficient >0.85.
Results Twenty four patients were studied and three patients were
excluded. The mean age was 61.2 ± 9.3 years, the ICU stay was
9.8 ± 4.1 days, the APACHE II score was 24.8 ± 5.7, and SAPS II
was 52.7 ± 10.4. The mean CVP measured with jugular or
subclavian access was 12.1 ± 4.1 mmHg and 12.9 ± 4.2 mmHg
at the femoral access. A good correlation between measurements
was found with a correlation coefficient and P > 0.001.
Conclusions CVP can be accurately measured in femoral
accesses, using standard CVC in patients with normal intra-
abdominal pressure.

Background Internal jugular vein cannulation has become one of
the most commonly attempted central lines used in the operation
rooms as well as in critically ill patients. There are three approaches
to the internal jugular vein (posterior, conventional, and anterior)
Methods We randomly studied 60 patients who underwent
percutaneous internal jugular vein cannulation with the supra-
clavicular (anterior) approach (30 patients) or the conventional
internal jugular approach (30 patients). The parameters observed
included success rates, complications, flow and waveform
characteristics and the acceptability of the technique both to the
operator and the patient.
Results There were no significant differences between the two
groups. First-attempt success and failure was the same in the two
groups. Easiness for the operator was higher in the supraclavicular
approach (P = 0.02). The number of complications (arterial
puncture [3–2], pneumothorax [0–0], hemothorax [0–0]) were not
different in the two groups. There were two significant differences in
flow and waveform characteristics between the two groups.
However, the supraclavicular approach was associated with greater
patient comfort (P < 0.00001) but difficult fixation. Kinking in CXR
in the ICU was higher in the supraclavicular group (P < 0.0001).
Conclusions We recommend the supraclavicular approach for
CVP line placement in the internal jugular vein in cardiac surgery
for experienced cardiac anesthesiologists.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P355 (doi: 10.1186/cc4702)
Introduction In principle, various factors may influence the
accuracy of transpulmonary thermodilution. We analyzed whether
veno-venous renal replacement therapy (RRT) has impact on the
measurement of cardiac index (CI), intrathoracic blood volume
index (ITBVI) and extravascular lung water index (EVLWI).
Methods With ethics approval, we studied 24 critically ill patients
(nine female, 15 male) undergoing monitoring by the trans-
pulmonary thermodilution technique for clinical indication and
veno-venous RRT. All patients had a 5-F femoral arterial catheter
and monitoring system (PV2015L20; Pulsion Medical Systems).
Twelve patients had a femoral venous 12-F dialysis catheter in situ
(Trilyse Expert; Vygon) and 12 patients had one placed in the
v. cava superior. All patients received heparin for anticoagulation of
the extracorporeal circuit. Measurements of CI, ITBVI and EVLWI
were performed in triplicate by injecting 15 ml saline (4-6°C)
through the distal port of a triple lumen central venous catheter
(Certofix Trio; Braun, Melsungen) into the v. cava superior during
RRT, during shortly interrupted therapy (disconnection) and
immediately after reconnection.
Results Global hemodynamics were comparable at the three time
points (mean ± SD). During RRT, the CI (mean change –0.1 l/min/m2,
P < 0.01) and ITBVI (mean change –18 ml/m2, P = 0.02) were
significantly lower. However, EVLWI was not influenced by RRT
(mean change +0.1 ml/kg, P = 0.42).

adequately volume-resuscitated patients in septic shock present a
hyperdynamic circulatory state with high cardiac output and
reduced systemic vascular resistance, and this profile seems to
persist throughout the septic event regardless of the outcome.
Myocardial depression in patients with septic shock is character-
ized by biventricular dilatation and decreased systolic contractile
function, all in the presence of an overall hyperdynamic circulation.
In addition, sepsis and septic shock is characterized by an
impaired sympathetic modulation of the heart, suggesting that a
central autonomic regulatory impairment contributes to the circula-
tory failure that is seen. The purpose of this study was to analyze
echocardiographic, ultrasonographic, hemodynamic and serum
cardiac markers in patients with septic shock and to evaluate their
relationship to the outcome.
Methods Prospective study on a six-bed ICU of a university
hospital and a five-bed medical ICU of a tertiary care hospital. Data
were collected over a period of 2 years. We studied 68 septic
patients that met the ACCP/SCCM consensus criteria for sepsis
and septic shock. All patients had continuous monitoring of blood
pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Blood samples were collected
on the first day of the septic shock and on days 3, 5, 7, and 10,
and were analyzed for troponin, CPK, CK-MB, SGOT, SGPT, and
LDH. Pulmonary artery catheterization was performed in all patients
and the results were recorded for the days in question. Cardiac
ultrasonography and echocardiography was also performed on the
aforementioned days. Measurements of the patients’ QT intervals
on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) were also made. The QT
interval was corrected (QTc) using the heart rate according to the
Bazett’s formula. The QT dispersion (QT-d) was defined as the
difference between the maximum and the minimum value of the
QTc in different leads. QT-d was measured and recorded for all the
aforementioned days`
Results The patients were divided into survivors and nonsurvivors.
We had 28 patients in the nonsurvivor group and 40 patients that
recovered from their septic shock. The mortality rate was
approximately 41%. The APACHE II scores for both groups were
similar with no significant difference during the study. A hyperdynamic
circulatory state with high cardiac output and low vascular resistance
was observed throughout the study, and no significant difference was
shown in any of the patients in either group. All the serum cardiac
markers except troponin showed no significant difference. Troponin
and stroke work analysis, however, showed a significant difference
between the two groups. Troponin levels showed a significant
difference from day 1 of the study and continued to the end, whereas
the stroke work analysis difference became evident from day 5 and
onwards. The QT-d measured from the ECG on days 1 and 3 were
significantly increased especially in the nonsurvivor group (49 ± 20
ms vs 34 ± 11 ms). QT-d measurements of the following days had
similar patterns to day 3 in either group.
Conclusion Heart dysfunction was evident by the troponin serum
values, by the QT-d and by the hemodynamic stroke work analysis.
All these variables presented a significant difference between
survivors and nonsurvivors during the study. The establishment of
heart dysfunction seems to correlate to patient outcome.

Introduction The prognosis of patients admitted to the ICU with
cardiogenic shock is poor.
Method Data were collected retrospectively between January
2004 and June 2005. Cardiac studies and inotrope use were
evaluated using Wilcoxon matched-pairs testing.
Results Twenty-eight patients received levosimendan. Ten (34%)
patients were admitted following cardiac surgery and nine (31%)
post acute myocardial infarction. The mean APACHE II score at
time of levosimendan was 19 (SE = 0.96). No patients received a
loading dose. The median maintenance dose was 0.1 µg/kg/min
for a median of 24 hours (range = 3–58). A reduction in the mean
dose of dobutamine (8.26 vs 3.77 µg/kg/min, n = 7, P = 0.031)
and milrinone (0.22 vs 0.12 µg/kg/min, n = 8, P = 0.031) was
seen 24 hours post levosimendan. A single patient developed atrial
fibrillation and there were no new reports of ischaemia. ICU
mortality was 62%.
Discussion Levosimendan had a favourable impact on the cardiac
index, systemic vascular resistance index and inotrope use in our
critically ill ICU patients at high risk of death. It was well tolerated in
terms of arrhythmias and cardiac ischaemia.

Objective To characterize the hemodynamic and echographic
effects of levosimendan in patients with cardiogenic shock
refractory to catecholamines.
Methods Nine patients (53.3 ± 19 years, five male/four female)
with persisting cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial
infarction (five cases), peripartum cardiomyopathy (two cases) or
dilated cardiomyopathy (two cases) were candidates for levosimen-
dan infusion. In all patients, a high dose of inotropic treatment
failed to improve hemodynamic parameters. Levosimendan was
introduced at a loading dose of 12 µg/kg followed by a continuous
infusion of 0.1 µg/kg/min for 24 hours. Hemodynamic measure-
ments were performed using a Swan–Ganz thermodilution catheter
(744HF75; Edwards Life Sciences, Carolina, USA) at baseline and
at 30 and 90 min, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after the start of
levosimendan. Transoesophageal echocardiography was performed
at baseline, 12 and 24 hours and then after 7 and 15 days in survivors.
Results Levosimendan induced a significant decline of pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistances,
followed by a significant increase in the cardiac index and mixed
venous oxygen saturation. Changes in the heart rate and mean
arterial blood pressure were not significant. The left ventricular
ejection fraction was improved from 24% to 40% within 48 hours.
Conclusion This study showed that the use of levosimendan in
cardiogenic shock improved hemodynamics and left ventricular
performance. Additional clinical trials on hemodynamics and
mortality are needed to safely broaden its indications in
cardiogenic shock.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P359 (doi: 10.1186/cc4706)
Right ventricular hypertrophy induced by chronic hypoxia is mainly
due to a mechanical stress upon the ventricular wall secondary to
pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, the hypoxic chronic
activation of the sympathetic nervous system can contribute to the
development of right ventricular hypertrophy either via myocardial
adrenergic receptors and/or a vasoconstriction and remodeling of
pulmonary arteries. To highlight the specific role of the sympathetic
nervous system on hypoxia-induced right ventricular hypertrophy,
and particularly the efficiency of carvedilol, our study compared
physiological, myocardial and pulmonary arterial morphometric
data in rats treated by α-prazosin, or β-propranolol or αβ-carvedilol
antagonist and exposed to chronic hypobaric hypoxia (2 weeks at
380 mmHg barometric pressure). In chronic hypoxia, both the
systolic right ventricular pressure and Fulton’s ratio (right / [left +
septum] ventricular weight) were lower in rats treated by prazosin
(–16.7% and –13.6%), propranolol (–28.6% and –12.7%) and
carvedilol (–15.9% and 14.3%), respectively, when compared with
glucose (P < 0.05). Surprisingly, prazosin was unable to reduce
right ventricle hypertrophy induced by chronic hypoxia, whereas
the left ventricular weight increased. The wall thickness index of
pulmonary arteries increased in chronic hypoxia and was reduced
by carvedilol. In conclusion, the hypoxia-induced activation of the
adrenergic system participates in the development of right
ventricular hypertrophy. Carvedilol is effective in reducing hypoxia-
induced right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary arterial hyper-
tension and muscularisation of pulmonary arteries.

on reactive nitrogen species and pulmonary function are still not
fully understood. We hypothesized that infusion of low-dose AVP
improves cardiopulmonary performance by limiting nitrate/nitrite
(NOx) and peroxynitrite (ONOO–) formation.
Methods Chronically instrumented sheep were randomly allocated
to: healthy controls (sham), injured controls (40%, third-degree
burn; 4 × 12 breaths of cotton smoke, <40°C), or an injured inter-
vention group treated with a continuous AVP infusion (0.02 U/min)
from 1 hour post injury to the remainder of the 24-hour period of
study (n = 6 each/group). Physiologic variables and NOx plasma
levels (chemiluminescence) were analyzed intermittently. Post
mortem, lung tissue was harvested for the determination of the
wet/dry weight ratio and airway obstruction. In addition, 3-nitrotyro-
sine concentrations (stable biomarker of ONOO–) in lung and
heart tissues were measured using immunohistochemistry and
ELISAs. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. For statistical
analysis a two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements with
appropriate post-hoc comparisons (Student–Newman–Keuls) was
performed.
Results There were no differences between groups at baseline. All
variables remained stable in sham animals throughout the entire
experiment. Compared with injured controls, AVP reduced NOx
plasma levels (24 hours: 9.5 ± 1.2 vs 4.5 ± 0.9 µmol/l), improved
PaO2/FiO2 ratio (24 hours: 214 ± 20 vs 431 ± 38, each P < 0.001)
and decreased the degree of pulmonary edema and airway
obstruction. In addition, AVP improved myocardial contractility, as
indexed by increased left ventricular stroke work index (24 hours:
52 ± 7 vs 87 ± 10 g/m/m2). Compared with injured controls, AVP
prevented the increase in 3-nitrotyrosine concentrations (lung:
43 ± 4 vs 32 ± 3 nM; heart: 37 ± 5 vs 22 ± 3 nM; P < 0.01 each).
Conclusion This study suggests that low-dose AVP infusion may
be a rational approach to attenuate cardiopulmonary dysfunctions
resulting from combined burn and smoke inhalation injury. The
effects of AVP in this model may be related to inhibition of the
cytotoxic ONOO–.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P361 (doi: 10.1186/cc4708)
Background The N-terminal prohormones of the A-type and B-
type natriuretic peptides (NTproANP and NTproBNP) are increasingly
used as humoral markers for myocardial dysfunction in various
clinical settings [1]. No data are available on the effects of angio-
tensin-converting-enzyme inhibition (ACE-I) on the plasma levels of
these hormones.
Materials and methods Ten healthy males were cross-over and
double-blind treated with 20 mg enalaprilat sodium or placebo (t0)
following 7 days on a sodium enriched-diet and an induction period
of 4 days with increasing doses of enalapril. After 4 hours (t4)
15 ml/kg NaCl 0.9% was infused over 60 min. Hemodynamics
were determined and blood was sampled at t0, t4, t5, t6, t8, and
t10 hours. NTproANP and NTproBNP were determined by radio-
luminescence and electrochemoluminescence immunoassays,
respectively. Data were analyzed as raw data and as relative
changes in comparison with baseline levels.
Results Arterial blood pressure was significantly lower after
enalapril treatment during the fourth day of induction and during
t0–t8 in comparison with control. Raw NT-proANP levels did not
change throughout the observation period; relative NTproANP
levels showed a short-lasting increase from t4 to t6 during control
and ACE-I (after sodium loading). Raw and relative plasma
NTproBNP levels increased from t0 to t10 during placebo and
enalapril (P < 0.001). No between-group differences were
observed in raw NTproBNP levels, while relative NTproBNP levels
were significantly higher after ACE-I in comparison with control at
t4 and t5 (Fig. 1).
Conclusions This suggests that ACE-I does not affect baseline
and stimulated plasma NTproANP levels but augments the
reactivity of the BNP system in sodium-loaded healthy individuals.
ACE-I may thus interfere with NTproBNP determinations in
sodium-retaining states.

Early administration of ββ-blockade in high-risk, acute
coronary syndrome patients
A Turley, M Stewart
James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P362 (doi: 10.1186/cc4709)
Introduction Acute coronary syndromes represent the life-
threatening phase of coronary artery disease. Over two decades
ago, two large randomised controlled trials showed a reduction in
early mortality when intravenous (i.v.) β-blockade was given acutely
to patients presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction [1,2].
β-Blockers also limit infarct size, reduce life-threatening arrhythmias,
relieve pain, prevent myocardial rupture and reduce reinfarction
rates. More recent data suggest that the early administration of β-
blockade with thrombolytic therapy or prior to primary percutaneous
coronary intervention also has significant benefits. Despite
evidence, the use of β-blockade in patients presenting with acute
myocardial infarction remains poor and i.v. β-blockade is rarely used.
Objectives and methods To assess the use of early (within 24
hours) β-blockade in patients presenting with acute ST elevation
myocardial infarction (MI). A prospective audit was carried out on
consecutive patients admitted to our coronary care unit over a 6-
month period.

Results In 6 months 87 patients were admitted (males 60, female
27). The average age was 65.5 years. Sixteen per cent of patients
(14/87) had had a previous MI and 41% (36/87) had three or
more risk factors for coronary artery disease. Presenting ECG,
54% (47/87) of patients had either an anterior (median TnT 7.3
ng/ml) or lateral (TnT 2.43 ng/ml) MI and 46% (40/87) a posterior
(TnT 6.11 ng/ml) or inferior MI (TnT 4.24 ng/ml). The majority of
patients received reperfusion therapy, 47% (41/87) thrombolysis
and 44% (38/87) were treated with primary percutaneous
intervention. Nine out of 87 did not receive reperfusion therapy due
to late presentation. The mean pulse on admission 75 (±23) bpm
and systolic BP 135 (±39) mmHg. Only seven patients received
intravenous β-blockade within the first 24 hours, with no adverse
reactions reported. Twenty-one out of 87 patients were already
taking a β-blocker at the time of admission. Fifty-three out of 87
received oral β-blockade within the first 24 hours and 67/87
patients were discharged on β-blockade. The average delay in
initiating β-blockade, 8.4 hours from admission. Contraindications
to β-blockade existed in 14% (12/87) of patients (5/87 second/
third-degree heart block, 5/87 severe heart failure and 2/87 asthma).
Conclusion During the acute phase of acute MI, β-blockade is
indicated in all patients without an absolute contraindication, and a
large evidence base supports their use. Our results have shown
that the early (<24 hours) use of β-blockade, and in particular i.v. β-
blockade, is low. This may in part be due to clinicians’ lack of
awareness of the benefits of early i.v. β-blockade, and ongoing
education is required.

Objective To evaluate the values of blood troponin T (T-T) in relation
to the values of cardiac ejection fraction (EF) in patients suffering sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to ruptured cerebral aneurysms
(RCA).
Patients and methods The present study was approved by the
local ethical committee and informed consent was obtained from
all patients and/or their relatives. During 1 April to 30 November,
10 patients were transferred to Kanemaru Hospital under
suspicion of SAH: they complained of sudden headache and/or
showed disturbed consciousness. The diagnosis for RCA with
SAH was obtained by checking the views from cranial computed
tomography (CT) and cerebral angiography. We also examined
blood samples to evaluate the blood T-T and also their cardiac
function using an echocardiogram machine (Sonos 4500; Philips).
To compare, we divided the patients into the two groups in relation
to the results of blood T-T: patients who showed negative results
(N-G) and patients who showed positive results (P-G),
respectively. Cardiac functions were evaluated using the values of
cardiac EF. T-T was measured using the kit Trop-T sensitive
(Roche). These values were obtained from blood samples drawn
from patients after more than 4 hours since the onset of the SAH
attack. Data were expressed as means (±SD). Statistical analysis
was performed using Statview software and P < 0.05 was thought
statistically significant.
Results In two patients, paired values could not be obtained and
we removed them from the study. Eventually, eight patients were
enrolled. Two female patients of all the eight patients showed
positive results in T-T and the other six patients (two male and four
female) showed negative results. The age was 70 (12.6) years with
the range of 43–80 in N-G and was 80.5 (0.7) years with the
range 80–81 in P-G, respectively. In N-G, the EF value was 73.1%
(6.2) with the range of 64–81, and in P-G was 39.5% (7.8) with
the range of 34–46, respectively. There was a significant
difference in the cardiac EF values between the two groups (P =
0.0003). However, no patient with normal cardiac function showed
a positive value of T-T. In addition, patients with disturbed cardiac
EF values less than 55% showed positive results in the T-T test.
The patients in P-G also showed giant negative T waves in their
electrical cardiogram.
Discussion Catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy can occur in
several kinds of diseases, one of which is SAH. It can induce
disturbed cardiac function. Many patients with SAH due to RCA
need surgical procedures, such as neck clipping. However, we also
need to obtain correct information about their general conditions
including the state of cardiac functions. Evaluations with measuring
cardiac EF and blood T-T could give us good information to
understand cardiac conditions. The information might also help
surgeons and anesthesiologists to decide when the surgical
procedures should be done or not. We can obtain the values of
blood T-T easily without special equipment and a talented technique.
Conclusion Some patients who suffered SAH due to RCA
showed disturbed cardiac dysfunctions. In assessing them, we
recommend measuring blood troponin T as an adjunctive method.

Cardiac troponin in the general adult critical care unit:
solution or problem
N Parekh, J Susrala, S Dorrain, S Balakrishnan

Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and troponin I (cTnI) are the most sensitive
and specific biochemical markers of myocardial injury available, but
do not indicate the mechanism of such injury [1]. There are many
problems with their interpretation in the critical care setting.
A recent editorial has highlighted that frequent determination of
troponin in the ICU patient can lead to ‘troponinitis’! [2]. The
editorial quotes various studies, including those showing
association between elevated cTnI levels and mortality. After
analysis of 346 samples measured over 22 months from our
general adult ICU (annual admissions 850), we also found a
statistical relationship between levels of elevated cTnI and both
ICU and hospital mortality (Table 1) using chi-square testing.
However, we have not found this to be clinically significant. A
hospital mortality of 51.2% may be high, but not so high as to
precipitate the withdrawal of intensive care treatment.
Due to the low specificity and positive predictive value of cTnI in
mixed adult general critical care patients, it is difficult for us as
intensivists to place elevated troponin levels in their clinical context.
We also have difficulty in using elevated troponin levels to
influence patient management in the absence of a classical history
and ECG changes. Thrombolysis, ACE-inhibitors and β-blockers
can be doubled-edged swords in the critically ill; echocardiography
in the resting patient provides scant meaningful information; a
pulmonary artery catheter is invasive – and all this before we
consider the risks associated with coronary angiography. We
therefore believe that cardiac troponins in a mixed adult ICU should
only be requested when it could confirm an acute coronary

syndrome. In the ICU setting, this would almost always entail
obtaining new ECG changes before requesting a cTnI level.

High incidence of elevated serum creatine kinase in the
ICU: an underestimated problem

Introduction An elevation in the serum creatine kinase (CPK) level
(without a simultaneous rise in the MB fraction or massive ischaemic
cerebral infarction) correlates with the extent of muscular damage.
Although usually asymptomatic, it could evolve into a life-threat-
ening condition of rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute renal
failure and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Critically ill
patients may present with an elevated CPK for a number of
different reasons. We performed an observational prospective pilot
study during 31 days in a mixed ICU in a tertiary referral teaching
hospital in order to study the incidence of elevated CPK levels and
its possible influence on outcome.
Subjects and methods With the exception of cardiac surgery
patients and children below the age of 16, all patients admitted to
the ICU were included. Patients were excluded when either an
elevated troponin I >0.50 ng/ml, an elevated CPK–MB fraction
(>6% of total CPK) or a cerebral infarction was present. A CPK level
>170 IU/l was arbitrarily defined as elevated. The number of patients
with CPK levels >2000 IU/l were also identified. We sought to
compare differences in 28-day mortality and length of stay (LOS) in
the ICU (max 28 days) and LOS in the hospital (max 28 days).
Results See Table 1. Most patients with an elevated CPK level
were surgical patients (including trauma). A cause could be
identified in 86% of all cases. Of the unidentified causes, 80%
were in medical patients. No statistical significance was observed
for mortality or LOS.
Conclusions Elevated CPK is frequently observed in a mixed ICU
population. Surgical patients are more prone to elevated CPK
levels than medical patients. Unexplained CPK elevation is more
observed in medical patients. LOS, mortality and the number of
patients with a LOS >28 days rise in parallel with the level of
elevation of CPK independent of the APACHE II score, although
no statistical significance could be observed. Further investigation
of the true incidence, complication rate and independent risk
factors for elevated CPK seems to be indicated.

Cerebral and cardiovascular pathology is the leading cause of the
death and invalidity in industrially developed countries. During
recent years new data allowed to increase significantly the
presentations of the pathogenesis of these diseases. They
revealed that hyperhomocysteinemia increases the risk of early
development of atherosclerosis and thrombosis of the coronary,
cerebral and peripheral arteries independently of the traditional risk
factors and it is the prognostic marker of the lethal outcome.
The objective of this study was to appreciate the role of homo-
cysteine in the development of the cerebral and cardiovascular
pathology (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction) in young persons.
We examined 28 patients during an acute period of the ischemic
stroke (IS) and 10 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
(mean age 45.1 ± 1.15 and 40.9 ± 2.34 years). Clinical evaluation
of the neurological status of the patients with IS was conducted
traditionally and according to the international clinical scales
determining neurological deficiency (Bartela, NIH-NINDS,
Orgogoso, Scandinavian, Index of the Disorders of Adoptive
Activity) at patient’s admission. The control group consisted of 15
healthy subjects (mean age 44.7 ± 1.02 years). The homocysteine
concentration in the blood was analyzed in all fasting patients on
the immunochemoluminescent analyzer ‘IMMULITE One’ (USA)
using the assay kit of ‘DPC’ production (USA).
We revealed the presence of the moderate hyperhomocysteinemia
in the patients with IS and AMI. The mean concentration of the
serum homocysteine exceeded the mean concentration of this
metabolite in healthy subjects by 57% and 48%, respectively.
The patients with IS had dependence of the clinical course of the
disease on the homocysteinemia level. In mild (n = 7) and
moderate (n = 9) neurological deficiency, the mean concentration
of homocysteine was 8.1 ± 0.65 and 10.8 ± 1.44 µmol/l
respectively. In expressed and gross (n = 11) neurological
deficiency, the mean concentration of homocysteine was 16.0 ±
2.44 µmol/l, which exceeded the control value by 85%. In two
patients with gross neurological deficiency and the highest values
of homocysteine, the disease finished by fatal outcome. All patients
with increased homocysteine concentration had atherosclerotic

changes of the vessels that were uncharacteristic for their age. All
patients had the atherothrombotic subtype of IS.
The development of AMI and the severe degree of the athero-
thrombotic subtype of IS in young persons may thus be conditioned
by increased homocysteine concentration provoking early forma-
tion of the atherosclerotic changes of the vessels and thrombosis.
The obtained data may be useful in the composition of programs of
the prophylactic measures.

coronary syndrome patients in a district hospital setting

Introduction Clinical deterioration is often preceded by a change
in physiological parameters. Inappropriate action to these changes
can lead to increased mortality. One way to identify the critically ill
patient is through physiologically based early warning scores
(EWS) [1,2]. Use of EWS scores is advocated by the Royal
College of Physicians, the Intensive Care Society and the Depart-
ment of Health. Several generic scoring systems are available,
although specific cardiac scoring systems also exist. The TIMI risk
score for patients with unstable angina and non-ST elevation
myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI), validated in several large
patient cohorts, is broadly applicable, easily calculated and
stratifies a patient’s risk of future events [3].
Aims and methods To assess the incidence of SIRS at the time of
presentation in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, and to
assess the use of medical EWS (modified EWS [MEWS] [1],
patient at-risk score [PARS] [2]) in high-risk ACS patients in a
district hospital setting to determine whether they correlate with
the validated TIMI UA/NSTEMI score. Over a 6-month period all
patients diagnosed with NSTEMI, identified via the hospital coding
system, were identified and a retrospective review was performed.
Results Seventy-four patients were identified (age 70.4 ± 10.8
years), of which 46/74 (62%) were male. Male patients were
younger 67.3 ± 10.6 vs 75.3 ± 9.4 years (P < 0.01) with a mean
TIMI score 5 vs 5.3 (P = NS). The admission route was split
49%/51% between A&E and primary care. Patients were managed
by cardiologists in 40% of cases. Most patients were managed on
CCU, 53/74 (71%), median age 69.3 ± 10.7 vs 73.1 ± 11 years
(P = NS). Over 60% of patients had a positive smoking history and
7/74 (8%) had undergone previous revascularisation.
In 22 (30%) patients a SIRS response was noted. Patients with a
SIRS response tended to have a slightly higher 12-hour troponin T
measurement (1.2 vs 0.7 ng/ml, P = 0.2), TIMI score (5.32 vs 5,
P = 0.15) and were older (74 vs 68.8 years, P = 0.06).
The median (range) MEWS and PARS scores were 1 (0–5) and 1
(0–8), respectively. There was no association between MEWS and
TIMI scores (r = –0.1, P = 0.5), or PARS and TIMI scores (r = 0.2,
P = 0.1). There was a positive association between MEWS and
PARS scores (r = 0.5, P < 0.001).
Conclusion EWS are used to identify patients at risk and to highlight
the fact that a patient is critically ill. Recording a patient’s physiological
variables should be part of the daily ward routine. The TIMI risk score
for patients with UA/NSTEMI should be used in patients with
symptoms and signs suggestive of an ACS and not medical EWS.

Introduction European guidelines recommend that ‘high-risk’ acute
coronary syndrome patients presenting to non-interventional
centres should be transferred to a tertiary care centre for diagnostic
coronary angiography ± coronary revascularisation within 72 hours
of admission [1].
Aims and methods To assess the contemporary management of
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients in a
district hospital setting. Over a 6-month period patients diagnosed
with NSTEMI, identified via the hospital coding system, were
identified and a retrospective review was performed.
Results Seventy-four patients were identified (age 70.4 ± 10.8
years), of which 46/74 (62%) were male. Male patients were
younger 67.3 ± 10.6 vs 75.3 ± 9.4 years (P < 0.01) with a mean
TIMI score 5.2 vs 5.4 (P = 0.3). The admission route was split
49%/51% between A&E and primary care. Patients were managed
by cardiologists in 40% of cases; 53/74 (71%) were managed on
CCU, median age 69.3 ± 10.7 vs 73.1 ± 11 years (P = 0.17) for
patients not on CCU. Over 60% of patients had a positive smoking
history and 7/74 (8%) had undergone previous revascularisation.
At the time of admission 61/74 (82%) patients received aspirin,
41/74 (55%) received LMWH and only 51/74 (69%) received
clopidogrel. Once the 12-hour troponin T result was available,
LMWH and clopidogrel use increased to 45/74 (61%) and 54/74
(73%), respectively. Only 33/74 (45%) patients were transferred
for further inpatient investigation, 11 from cardiologists and 22
from noncardiologists. Four patients underwent outpatient diagnostic
angiography. Patients who were transferred were younger, 64.3 vs
75.2 years (P < 0.001), although had similar TIMI risk scores to
those not transferred, 5.2 vs 5.3 (P = 0.56), and had 12-hour
troponin T values, 0.7 vs 1 ng/ml (P = 0.29). Other than age there
were no other significant differences in the specific TIMI risk score
features. In the cohort, 15/23 (65%) <65 years, 16/23 (70%)
65–75 years and only 2/28 (7%) >75 years were transferred. Prior
to transfer no patients received a GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist. In
the 41/74 patients who were not transferred, four (10%) died
during their inpatient stay (TIMI score 5.5 vs 5.3 for survivors, P =
0.5). Patients who died were older 76.5 vs 70 years (P = 0.25).
Only 23/41 (56%) of patients not transferred were discharged on
Clopidogrel with no significant difference in age.
Conclusion The use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies in
the treatment of high-risk ACS patients is suboptimal. It might be
more appropriate to start these therapies on admission and not
once troponin results become available, with a view to
discontinuing treatment subsequently in those deemed unlikely to
benefit. The low rate of compliance with the guidelines might be
partly explained by uncertainties about the management of the
elderly.

Introduction The presence of multicoronary artery disease is a
predictor of a worse prognosis in patients who suffer from an acute
coronary syndrome (ACS). The objective of this study is to identify
all clinical factors that are indicative of multicoronary artery disease
in those patients who are suffering from an ACS.
Materials and methods One hundred patients with an ACS,
admitted to our CCU, were studied prospectively. Sixty-nine
percent presented a non-ST segment elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI) and 13% a ST segment elevation myocardial
infarction (STEMI). During their hospitalization we registered
cardiovascular risk factors; we determined the presence of
microalbuminuria (MA) (>3 mg/dl) in a 24-hour urine sample. We
also took blood samples in the first 24 hours of their admittance to
the CCU for a complete hemogram, levels of total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, HbAc1, high-
sensibility C-reactive protein (HS-CRP) and a follow-up of levels of
troponin, CK and CK-MB. All patients were submitted to a
coronary angiography in the first 72 hours to give a clinical score to
their coronary artery disease (disease of one, two or three arteries).
Results We observed that the antecedents of diabetes mellitus
(P = 0.000), hyperlipemia (P = 0.000), arterial hypertension, ischemic
heart disease (P = 0.000), ictus (P = 0.000), periphery artery
disease (P = 0.000), chronic renal insufficiency (P = 0.000), type
of ACS (NSTEMI, P = 0.000), development of cardiac failure
during hospitalization (P = 0.000), and lowering of ST segment on
EKG (P = 0.025) present a greater extent of coronary artery
disease. In the biochemical parameters we found that levels of
tropinin, CK and CK-MB were significantly inferior in patients with
a more extended coronary artery disease (P = 0.05), and high
levels of fibrinogen corresponded to a more severe coronary artery
disease (P = 0.03). The levels of HS-CRP and MA did not
evidence differences in the severity of coronary artery disease.
Conclusions By means of numerous clinical factors and
biochemical parameters it is possible to determine easily the
severity and extension of coronary artery disease of each patient
during his/her stay in the CCU.

Background Patients with ST segment elevation myocardial
infarction usually have a total coronary thrombotic occlusion, and
acute reperfusion reduces mortality in this setting. In contrast,
patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction
(NSTEMI) represent a more heterogeneous group in which a non-
occlusive thrombus has been suggested as a main patho-
physiologic mechanism. However, some of these patients may also
present a total coronary occlusion but they are not identified as an
early reperfusion target.
Methods Our objective was to analyze the TIMI flow status in 120
consecutive patients with their first NSTEMI. The admission 12-
lead ECG and coronary angiographies were reviewed and
coronary occlusion was defined as TIMI flow <3. Patients with Q
waves or ST segment elevation with reperfusion criteria were
excluded.
Results Mean age was 64 ± 15 years, 78 males (65%). In 77
(64%) patients the culprit lesion was identified, in 33 (27%) there
were >1 possible culprit lesions, and no significant stenosis were
found in 10 patients. Fifty-one patients (42%) presented TIMI <3
(30 TIMI 0, eight TIMI 1, 13 TIMI 2) in at least one major coronary
artery. Collateral flow was found in 20 (17%). Thirty-two percent of
patients presented one-vessel, 35% two-vessel and 22% three-
vessel disease. Seventy-four patients were treated with GP IIb/IIIa
antagonist and in 74 a PTCA was performed (93%). Two patients
died during admission.
Among 77 patients, in which the culprit lesion was identified (44%
circumflex [CX], 36% left anterior descending coronary artery
[LAD] and 19% right coronary artery [RC]), coronary occlusion
was present in 38 (50%) (60% CX, 29% LAD and 10% RC, P <
0.012). Patients with culprit coronary occlusions were younger
(59.5 ± 13 vs 65 ± 12 years, P = 0.03), tended to have a higher
incidence of smoking and had a larger myocardial necrosis (CK
MB mass 108 ± 99 vs 64 ± 60, P = 0.02) than those with
nonoccluded culprits.
Conclusion The presence of a culprit coronary occlusion, in nearly
one-half of the patients with a first NSTEMI, emphasizes the need
to better identify, clinically and electrocardiographically, those that
could benefit from early thrombolysis or primary angioplasty.

Introduction Different pathogenic mechanisms have been suggested
for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ST segment elevation (STEMI)
or without ST segment elevation (NSTEMI) and for unstable angina
(UA). Our objective was to analyze the incidence of different types of
ACS in relation to the temporal occurrence, as first or recurrent ACS.
Methods Six hundred and twenty consecutive patients admitted to
a cardiology ward due to ACS during 12 months were studied.
The ACS were divided into UA, STEMI and NSTEMI. Previous
ACS episodes, the clinical profile and angiographic information
were recorded.
Results The mean age was 67.4 ± 14 years, 447 (72%) males.
The ACS type was 251 (40%) UA, 168 (27%) STEMI and 201
(32%) NSTEMI. In 408 (66%) patients it was the first admission
due to ACS, 120 (29%) UA, 146 (36%) STEMI and 142 (35%)
NSTEMI. The incidence of STEMI was higher in the first episode
than among 213 second episodes (169 [27%] UA, 244 [39%]
STEMI and 181 [29%] NSTEMI vs 140 [66%] UA, 20 [9%] STEMI
and 53 [25%] NSTEMI, P < 0.001). The average time between first
and second ACS was 51.9 ± 60 months. Patients with recurrent
ACS presented more incidence of male sex (174 [82%] vs 273
[67%], P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (69 [33%] vs 102 [25%], P =

0.045), hypercholesterolemia (123 [58%] vs 153 [37%], P < 0.001),
hypertension (124 [58%] vs 202 [49%], P = 0.034) and peri-
pheral arterial disease (40 [20%] vs 31 [8%], P < 0.001) than
patients without recurrent ACS. Patients with recurrent ACS also
presented less ejection fraction (52.8 ± 14 vs 56 ± 13, P = 0.007)
and less incidence of one-vessel disease (46 [22%] vs 140 [34%],
P = 0.001).
Conclusion STEMI appears more frequently in a first ACS rather
than in a recurrent ACS. Patients who suffer from recurrent ACS
demonstrated a worst cardiovascular profile

Anoxia or ischemia causes an accumulation of long-chain fatty acid
esters mainly because of the inhibition of B oxidation. These
compounds have deleterious effects on cellular and intracellular
membranes. They also inhibit mitochondrial adenine nucleotide
translocase inducing inhibition of ATP within the mitochondrial
matrix, thus rendering it unavailable for myocardial cell contractility.
L-carnitine (L-C) protects against these negative effects by
decreasing the acylcoenzyme A (acyl CoA) through formation of
the corresponding acyl carnitine that is less harmful and diffuses
freely across the cell membrane.
To assess the effects of L-C in preserving the ischemic myocardium
following acute myocardium infarction (MI) and in limiting the extent
of ischemic damage, we studied 14 patients with acute MI (13
male, one female, mean age 55 years, range 38–72 years). Acute
MI was anterior in nine patients, inferior in three patients and
combined in two patients. Twelve patients admitted concurrently
with acute MI (10 male, one female, mean age 56.5 years) served
as the control group. Following admission all patients and controls
were subjected to reperfusion therapy in the form of primary PCI
(12 patients) and thrombolytic treatment (four patients), while only
12 patients were out of the reperfusion window and were started on
conservative medical treatment. Twenty-four hours following
therapeutic intervention, the study group received oral L-C in a dose
of 1.8 g daily, following a baseline study by M-mode and 2D
echocardiography together with rest myocardial perfusion imaging
using Tc99 sesta MIBI scintigraphy before and after 1 month of L-C
administration. Both imaging techniques were repeated and the
serum L-C level was measured in our laboratory and maintained at
20 ± 5 mg/l. Echocardiographic parameters assessed included left
ventricular end diastolic diameter, left ventricular end systolic
diameter and ejection fraction (EF). Scintigraphically the
myocardium was divided into 20 segments to assess RWMA with
application of a 0–4 scoring system to obtain the initial ischemic
segment (summed score) and the difference between the two
summed scores in both studies with an estimated LVEF from gated
SPECT techniques. Compared with the control group on
conventional therapy, the L-C group exhibited a significantly greater
EF from a baseline reading of 57% and 49%, respectively, to 53%
and 56.7% after L-C treatment, respectively (i.e. 12% improvement in
EF in the L-C group vs 7% decline in the control group). Assessed by
scintigraphy the summed score for the L-C group declined from
34.8% to 20.5% following treatment vs 17.5% and 21% for the
control group (i.e. 41% improvement in the study group vs 16%
worsening in the control group), with a significantly lower myocardium
salvage (44.3% in the study group vs –20% in control group).
In conclusion, as a metabolic supplement the early administration
of L-C to patients with acute MI provides a significant metabolic
support to the ischemic myocardium, helping to limit consequence
sequences of ischemic damage and to improve viability.

Objective To investigate the differences in the substrates, triggers
and prognosis between patients who suffer an acute pulmonary
edema (APE) with preserved ejection fractions and those with
depressed ejection fractions.
Methods Prospectively, during a period of 22 months all patients
admitted to an emergency unit due to APE were studied. We
selected for this analysis patients with documented coronary heart
disease. Clinical, echocardiographic, and angiographic charac-
teristics of patients with preserved ejection fractions (EF ≥ 50%, n =
49 [27%]) were compared with those of patients with depressed
ejection fractions (EF < 50%, n = 130 [73%]). A follow-up, after a
minimum of 1 year, was conducted in 96% of the cases.
Results Patients with EF ≥ 50% were predominantly female (30
[61%] vs 48 [37%], P < 0.001), hypertensive (41 [84%] vs 86
[66%], P = 0.02), and had an increased history of atrial fibrillation
paroxysms (13 [26%] vs 15 [11%], P = 0.01). In the acute phase
of pulmonary edema those patients with EF > 50% had more rapid
atrial fibrillation (12 [25%] vs 8 [6%], P < 0.001) and higher
systolic blood pressure levels (171 ± 50 vs 152 ± 39, P = 0.01).
Between both groups, there were no differences in the extension
of coronary disease, the incidence and severity of mitral regurgi-
tation, and the presence of restrictive mitral patterns. Patients with
EF ≥ 50% presented a lower 1-year global mortality rate (7 [16%]
vs 46 [37%], P = 0.008) and a similar incidence of recidivism of
APE episodes after discharge (14 [31%] vs 34 [33%], P = 0.85).
Conclusions Patients with coronary heart disease who suffer an
APE with EF > 50% present different clinical profiles than those
with EF < 50% and a lower mortality rate in the follow-up.
Surprisingly, however, both groups have the same probability of
recurrence of APE.

Background In the past few years it has been found that primary
restoration of the IRA following recent myocardial infarction is the
best solution for preserving the left ventricular function.
Objective To assess the importance and benefit of early primary
PCI.
Methods Our study included 40 patients (35 males, five females,
mean age 50.9 years) with first anterior MI. They were divided into
two groups. Group A (20 patients) who had the chance of
undergoing primary PCI within a mean 5.4 hours of the start of

chest pain and a door to balloon time of 1.6 hours, and group B
(20 patients) with delayed hospitalization (i.e. >12 hours) and
neither received thrombolytic nor primary PCI, but were scheduled
as routine PCI with mean 20.7 days. The LV function and
dimensions were assessed by serial echocardiographic readings
measuring left ventricle end diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricle
end systolic volume (LVESV), ejection fraction (EF), regional wall
motion scoring index (RWMI) at 24 hours of admission and after 3
and 6 months. Results are expressed as the mean ± SD, with P <
0.05 considered significant.
Results At 3 months, group A showed significant improvement in
RWMI (from 1.9 ± 0.3 to 1.27 ± 0.13) with P = 0.032 and there
was a nonsignificant increase in the LVEDV value (from 101 ±17.6
to 109 ± 20.1), and it was found that there was a minimal change
in the EF value in group A (59.6 ± 3.9% at baseline to 58.5 ±
0.5%). At 6 months, there was no more improvement in the RWMI
in both groups but the delayed group showed a marked increase in
LVEDV (from 98.3 ± 22.3 at baseline to 138 ± 32.96 after 6 months;
i.e. 38.9% increase in volume versus <20% changes in the primary
group [from 101 ± 17.6 at baseline to 115 ± 32.14 at 6 months],
and P ≤ 0.05). Whereas the EF% value was nearly preserved in
group A (59.6 ± 3.9% at baseline to 59.9 ± 6.81%) there was
remarkable deterioration in the EF% value in the delayed group
(from 57.1 ± 9.3% at baseline to 51.8 ± 10.8% after 6 months). In
spite of early restoration of blood flow in the IRA in group A, and
the marked improvement in the RWMI, there were only two
patients (10%) who had an increase in the LVEDV >20% of the
baseline echo (from 87.5 to 116), with a deterioration in the EF%;
they were both diabetic and both hypertensive, with an arrival time
to hospital of 7.5 hours and a door to balloon time of 2 hours (i.e.
> mean time of group A by 30%).
Conclusion Our data showed that early and immediate
revascularization (primary PCI) is superior to delayed, but a few
minutes of microcirculation obstructions can still affect left
ventricular function in spite of prompt revascularization.

PRONECT: a multiprofessional training course in the care
of the acute myocardial infarction

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P375 (doi: 10.1186/cc4722)
The Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) Recognition and Treatment
(PRONECT™) course is a 1-day (3-hour) course originally designed
to give doctors greater confidence and ability in the recognition
and management of adult patients who have AMI. It may also be
suitable for many other groups of health professionals. PRONECT™
was developed using principles common to many advanced life
support courses and incorporates aspects of clinical governance,
multidisciplinary education and interprofessional working. It
incorporates precourse reading, informal and interactive seminars,
and role-play during three clinically based scenarios. A novel
aspect of PRONECT™ is that participants undertake role inter-
change during scenarios, thereby facilitating mutual understanding.
At all times during the course, participants are encouraged to
reflect on their actions and to pay particular attention to detail.
Using initial and final theoretical written tests, after the 3-month
courses (36 courses), we assessed the knowledge of aspects of AMI
among 900 doctors. The average (±SD) knowledge score was higher
for those who had completed a PRONECT™ course, pre-test (545
students) = 23.8 (8.44 ± 1.30) points and post-test (834 students) =
25.3 (9.85 ± 2.12) points (P < 0.05). In addition, those in the post-
PRONECT™ group also showed significantly better knowledge about
AMI (85.6% [714 doctors]) and acquired skills in treatment an AMI.
We have demonstrated evidence that doctors’ knowledge of AMI can
be improved by attending courses such as PRONECT™.

The advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) course is a continued
medical educational proposal in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and
cardiovascular emergencies. The course is part of program of
Emergency Cardiovascular Care by the American Heart
Association (AHA), which in the United States is one the most
successful initiatives of public health of the past decades. The
manager of the course and training of this program in Brazil is the
National Council of Resuscitation (CNR), which has several
regional training centers that develop these activities.
In Minas Gerais the training center was created in 1998, it belongs to
the local society of critical care (SOMITI) and administers the courses
of ACLS and basic life support. The courses follow the AHA protocol.
Every 4 years, the protocol is revised, and the training topics are
replaced to become more updated in techniques and didatics as well.
In September 2000 at the World Council on Science in
Resuscitation, in California, the last review happened, when the
guidelines were standardized all over the world and the course of
ACLS was remodeled. The changes in the way of teaching the
course were basically in the didactics of the program, with the
withdrawing of theoretical classes and an increase of the practical
classes. It therefore becomes necessary to develop this study with
the main goal of evaluating comparatively the results of the
students in the theoretical valuations of the course of ACLS
provider, between the two teaching modalities.
The study concerns an exploratory study, transversal design,
accomplished at the training center of the SOMITI, in Belo Horizonte,
MG. The sample was composed of 173 valuations of the pre and post
tests, of eight classes of the course, four of each teaching modality.
The data are from the data bank of the mentioned training center. The
results show about the student profile that most of them were
physicians, general practitioners, within 5 years or less of graduation,
and act in critical care. About the comparative analysis, there was no
difference in the theoretical evaluations between the two teaching
modalities, concerning the theoretical knowledge of the students,
during the course. We hope that results of this study help in increasing
the instructors’ knowledge about the students’ results on the
evaluations, allowing and stimulating considerations about its actions
and becoming a reference to the other training and research centers.

massage in 1960. Despite this progress, there has been no
significant improvement in survival rates after inhospital cardiac
arrest over the past 40 years. In a general hospital, survival rates at
discharge, not considering specifically ICU patients, is around
15–20%. Few data are available considering survival in cardiologic
care units.
Methods Between April 2004 and December 2004 we recorded
and analysed all attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a
medical ICU of a teaching cardiologic hospital. The patients were
64 ± 20 years old, 44 (62.8%) male and 26 (37.2%) female.
Diagnosis at admission in ICU were: cardiogenic and/or septic
shock 37.2%, heart failure (NYHA IV) 20%, acute coronary
syndrome 21.4%, acute respiratory failure 10%, others 11.4%.
Associated diseases: acute renal failure 68.5%, hypertension 60%,
diabetes mellitus 37.2%, COPD 10%, infection 91.5%. Using an
Utestein-based template, data were collected immediately after
each resuscitation, by physicians who have performed CPR. They
were previously certified in acute cardiac life support (ACLS).
Results Seventy cardiopulmonary arrests were recorded in 50
patients. Of these, 49% returned to spontaneous circulation and
4% had hospital discharge. Twelve patients had more than one
event. First pulseless rhythm was divided as follows: VF/VT
(14.08%), asystole (19.7%), PEA (66.22%). Predictive factors of
return to spontaneous circulation in univariate analysis were: time
from ICU admission to cardiopulmonary arrest ≤7 days (P = 0.03)
age <75 years (P = 0.003), time of CPR <18 min (P = 0.0001). In
multivariate analysis, only the time from admission to the ICU to
cardiopulmonary arrest ≤7 days was predictive of a return to
spontaneous circulation (P = 0.015, OR 1.19, CI 95% 0.6–5.9).
Conclusion Survival after CPR in cardiac patients is poor,
Considering our population, it is lower than that observed in
general hospital patients. These data could help physicians in
attempting resuscitation, patients and families in making end-of-life
decisions.

Background Numerous reports document the efficacy of pediatric
inhospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). There are few data
about pediatric patients with heart diseases.
Methods All inhospital CPRs in children during 12 months at a
university hospital of cardiology, were described and evaluated using
Utstein reporting guidelines. CPR was defined as chest
compression and assisted ventilation or defibrillation provided
because of cardiac arrest or severe bradycardia with poor perfusion.
Results A total of 110 attempted resuscitations were performed in
55 children. From these patients 72.2% had return to spontaneous
circulation and 21.4% were discharged alive. Most of the children
had congenital heart disease (74.5%). Bradycardia with poor
perfusion were present in 55.4% as an initial rhythm of the 110
episodes, asystole in 18.2%, electric activity without pulse in
15.4% and ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia without pulse in
10.90%.The most common precipitating causes were hypotension
(22.8%), arrythmias (17.3%), metabolic disturbance (17.3%) and
hypoxemia (14.2%). Univariate predictive factors correlating with
hospital discharge were hypoxemia as the precipitating cause of
arrest, duration of resuscitation <10 min and single cardiac arrest.
In addition administration of bicarbonate, three or more doses of
epinephrine during resuscitation, vasoactive drugs and mechanical
ventilation at moment of cardiac arrest were negatively associated
with survival. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis
identified independent association of survival with duration of
resuscitation <10 min (OR 36.5, 95% CI 3.6–366.3) and single
arrest (OR 17.1, 95% CI 1.6–181.3).
Conclusion Survival to hospital discharge and predictors of
children with heart diseases and cardiac arrest are similar to
patients in general pediatric hospitals.

Unidirectional blood flow can be naturally generated by
changing intravascular pressure: an extracorporeal model
for elucidating the blood flow mechanism in CPR

Objectives There are two mechanisms for the generation of
forward blood flow during extrathoracic cardiac compression for
cardiac arrest; direct cardiac compression and thoracic pump. We
postulate that the difference of vascular resistance from the arterial
to peripheral capillary in tandem and the existence of competent
venous valves make it possible for blood to flow forwardly by a
simple change of intravascular pressure in a cardiac arrest model.
Methods A mongrel dog was anesthetized with i.v. sodium
pentobarbital. The dog was mechanically ventilated. The right
femoral artery was cannulated. A double lumen catheter was
introduced via the external jugular vein. The cardiac rhythm and
heart rate were monitored. Midline thoracotomy was performed.
After the infusion of heparin 300 U/kg, KCl 20 mEq was injected
intravenously to induce cardiac arrest. A Y-shaped extracorporeal
circuit was primed with heparinized normal saline beforehand.
Each end of the two branches of the circuit has a 3/8-inch
connector, respectively, and the other end was connected with a
50 cm3 syringe. A connector was introduced at the junction of the
SVC and IVC via the right atrium. The aorta was transected above
the aortic valve and another 3/8-inch connector was inserted
directly into the ascending aorta. Indocyanine green dye was
injected via the connector of the right atrium.
Results At the beginning of syringe resuscitation, aortic and vena
caval blood was drained slightly during the suction phase and the
blood moved to in both directions during the push phase; however,
the dye transferred gradually from the vena cavae to arterial side
while showing a concomitant to-and-fro movement of its own with
the repeated piston movement.
Conclusion We observed that forward blood movement from the
aorta to peripheral artery occurred without cardiac valves while
changing the intravascular pressure using a syringe pump. This
proves that an intravascular pressure change generated by direct
cardiac compression or an intrathoracic pump during external
cardiac compression can produce systemic blood flow probably
both by the innate vascular resistance difference and by the
intravenous valvular patency, irrespective of cardiac valve motion.

Impact of bystander cardiopulmonary and cerebral
resuscitation in the prehospital setting on survival rates in
the short and long term

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P380 (doi: 10.1186/cc4727)
Background The results of CPCR attempts after cardiac arrest
(CA) are very poor because of the irreversible brain damage,
myocardium damage and other organ damage that may occur
within 4 min of no blood flow. Early initiation of CPCR by a
bystander is crucial, in order to obtain a low blood flow up to the
arrival of the mobile intensive care unit (MICU).
Objective To evaluate the impact of resuscitation by a bystander
on the short-term outcome (STO) and long-term outcome (LTO).
Methods A consecutive and prospective study over a period of
5.5 years (1 January 1999–9 July 2004) was conducted. The
patients were treated by the MICU of the Academic Hospital of the
Vrije Universiteit Brussel (AZ-VUB) onsite and later on in the
Emergency Department (ED).
Results In patients who were initially resuscitated by a bystander
before arrival of the MICU, ROSC was achieved in 66 (35.29%)
cases, while 114 (60.96%) patients were declared dead on the
scene. CPCR was continued during transport to the ED in seven
(3.74%) patients. When CPCR was initiated by the MICU, ROSC
was achieved in 207 (13.81) patients, and 1278 (85.26%) did not
achieved ROSC. CPCR was continued during transport to the ED
for 14 (0.93%) patients.
One year after resuscitation, 66 (44.07%) of the patients that were
initially resuscitated by a bystander and thereby resumed ROSC
were still alive, and 33 (55.93%) were declared dead. Out of the
patients that were initially resuscitated by the MICU or the first tier
and achieved a ROSC, 20 (15.50%) were still alive 1 year after the
event and 109 (84.50%) were dead.
Conclusions Bystander CPCR plays a crucial role in the chain of
survival. Compared with patients that were initially not resuscitated by
a bystander, significant differences in the STO and LTO are observed.

university hospital

Introduction Cardiac arrest is the third leading cause of coma,
second only to trauma and drug overdose. Over the past two
decades several publications have reported the outcome of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for inhospital cardiac arrest.
Only a sparse amount of data is available concerning the initial
CPR success rates and long-term survival in adult ICUs from
Germany. Initial CPR success rates range from 16.8% to 44% and
long-term survival to discharge from hospital ranges from 3.1% to
16.5%. Although the initial successful resuscitation rate in ICU
patients may be high, long-term and hospital discharge rates have
been reported to be unsatisfactory.
Objective To evaluate the demographic characteristics of patients
who suffered cardiac arrest in our ICUs as well as to identify those
factors influencing outcome after resuscitation following cardiac arrest.
Methods We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent
CPR in our ICUs at the Georg-August University Hospital
Göettingen, Germany from January 1999 to December 2003. The
GISI database was used to search for all admissions to these
ICUs, and records of patients who had CPR during their stay in the
ICUs were retrieved and studied.
Results During the study period, 169 patients underwent CPR.
Eighty of the 169 patients with confirmed inhospital arrest survived
to hospital discharge, giving a survival to hospital discharge rate of
47.3%. The initial monitored rhythm recorded at the time of arrest
was asystole in 99 (58.6%) patients. Ventricular tachycardia/
fibrillation was recorded in 59 (34.9%) and pulseless electrical
activity in seven (4.1%) patients. Forty-six (54.8% of the survivors),
31 (36.9%) and five (6.0%) patients with initial recorded asystole,
VT/VF and PEA rhythms, respectively, survived to hospital discharge.
Of the 80 patients that survived to hospital discharge 75 (93.8%)
achieved good cerebral recovery (CPC 1 or CPC 2) and were alert
and fully oriented on discharge; four patients (5.0%) were severely
disabled (CPC 3), while one (1.2%) remained unconscious and was
reported dead 5 days after discharge to another local hospital.
Illness severity as assessed by the SAPS II score on admission was
38.8 ± 16.0. None of our patients with SAPS II score >40 24 hours
after CPR survived to be discharged from the ICU.
Conclusion Our study showed that nearly half the patients that
had cardiac arrest in our hospital ICUs had a favourable outcome
despite initial rhythms that are traditionally associated with a poor
outcome. This confirms that good results are achievable in these
groups of patients. The overall survival (47.3%) from CPR is close
to that reported internationally. Advancing age, coexisting diseases
and early initiation of the resuscitation protocol had significant
effects on the outcome of CPR as observed in our study.

Introduction In Japan, the out-of-hospital emergency medical service
(EMS) system has been established by the ambulance service and
an emergency life-saving technician (ELST) belonging to the fire
department, and the inhospital Emergency Department has been
supporting this system. The licence of ELST was established in
1991 and has been enlarging their activity; defibrillation, infusion of
Ringer solution, insertion of a laryngeal mask, EGTA, and laryngeal
tube. Moreover, now some of them who have received prearranged
education can be permitted to perform endotracheal intubation and
infusion therapy of epinephrine. Recently television stations
frequently deal with ELST, resulting in enlightenment of many citizens
on the importance of immediate CPR and defibrillation. In this study,
we examined recent circumstances of out-of-hospital CPA in a
Japanese typical urban city.
Methods Patients’ records of our Emergency Department were
reviewed for the past year. In our city, Yokohama (3,700,000
people), the CPA patient is transferred to the nearest emergency
department of 11 hospitals, which are selected because of their
adequate ability of CPR and cerebral resuscitation for CPA patients.
In our department, we usually perform echocardiography and
abdominal sonography, chest X-ray examination, blood examination
including troponin I or T, and cerebral plane CT or chest CT to
determine cause of CPA and to treat this pathological condition.
Results In our Emergency Department, we dealt with 250 CPA
patients in the past year, 95 of whom were cardiac aetiology and
155 of whom were noncardiac aetiology. Eleven were SAH and 14
were acute aortic dissection diagnosed by CT or ultrasonography.

S161
In cardiac aetiology patients, 31 were witnessed. Six of them were
witnessed by an ELST during transfer and 25 were witnessed by a
layperson; 16 were witnessed by patients’ families, three by
patients’ friends, and four by a passenger. Seventeen were
witnessed in the patient’s home, 13 of whom were witnessed in
the patient’s private room, two were in the bathroom, and one in
the lavatory. Only eight of 25 witnessed CPA patients underwent
bystander CPR, who underwent bystander CPR mainly in the
patients’ homes by the patients’ families.
Conclusion In Japan, we often encountered CPA patients with
noncardiac aetiology, including SAH or acute aortic dissection.
CPA patients were witnessed mainly in their home, particularly in
their private room, bathroom, and lavatory. However, only eight
CPA patients underwent bystander CPR. We should enlighten
citizens (potential patients’ families) on the importance of
immediate CPR to save CPA patients.

Implementation of the new European Resuscitation
Council guidelines regarding epinephrine administration
during out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary and cerebral
resuscitation, and its effect on the outcome of the patients
P Flamee, S Hachimi-Idrissi
AZ VUB, Brussels, Belgium
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P383 (doi: 10.1186/cc4730)
Background Epinephrine has been used in cardiopulmonary and
cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) procedures since the end of the
nineteenth century. Since the 1960s an epinephrine dose of 1 mg
up to 5 mg, every 5 min, was recommended. According to the
current international guidelines from the European Resuscitation
Council (ERC), only 1 mg every 3–5 min should be administered
and hereby discourage administration of high doses of epinephrine.
Objective To investigate the implementation of the new guidelines
for CPCR, in the out-of-hospital setting, regarding the
administration of the standard dose of 1 mg epinephrine during
resuscitation, and its influence on the outcome of the patients.
Methods A consecutive and prospective study over a period of 5.5
years (1 January 1999–9 July 2004) was conducted. The patients
were treated by the MICU of the Academic Hospital of the Vrije
Universiteit Brussel (AZ-VUB) onsite and later on in the Emergency
Department (ED).
Results Correct implementation of the new ERC guidelines
regarding epinephrine administration during resuscitation was seen
in 564 (58.39%) of 966 patients. In 402 (41.61%) patients an
excessive dose of epinephrine (EDE), relative to CPCR duration,
was given. From those 564 (58.39%) patients where the
guidelines were correctly implemented, 180 (31.91%) achieved
ROSC, 337 (59.75%) died on the scene, and 47 (8.33%) were
still being resuscitated during their transport to the ED. From the
402 (41.61%) patients where the guidelines were not properly
implemented, 90 (22.39%) patients achieved ROSC, while 290
(72.14%) patients were declared dead. In 22 (5.47%) patients,
CPCR was continued up to the ED. Evaluation of the LTO in
patients that received a guideline-respected dose of epinephrine
revealed that: 93 (58.49%) patients were still alive 1 year after
resuscitation, and 32 (41.51%) were dead. For those whom
received an EDE, relative to CPCR duration, 180 (60.00%)
survived and 32 (40.00%) died 1 year after resuscitation.
Conclusions There is a lack of adherence to the current guidelines
regarding epinephrine administration during CPCR. Moreover, 1 mg
epinephrine each 3–5 min seems to increase the percentage of
ROSC, but unfortunately this beneficial effect disappears 1 year
after the insult.

Predicting failure to survive cardiopulmonary resuscitation
in intensive care: evaluation of two morbidity scores
K Enohumah, O Mörer, J Hinz, J Bahr, P Neumann
Georg-August University Hospital, Göttingen, Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P384 (doi: 10.1186/cc4731)
Introduction Major advances have been made in providing prompt
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to cardiac arrest patients
within the hospital. As patients undergoing cardiac surgery
become older and sicker with concomitant co-morbidities, the
quality of immediate and long-term postoperative care as well as
resuscitation are likely to become increasingly important.
Inappropriate and unsuccessful resuscitation of these patients is
associated with a large expenditure of health care resources. CPR
is a time-consuming and resource-consuming procedure that was
never originally recommended for all patients. Gillon [1] described
CPR as ‘violent, painful and undignified’. Therefore, the goal of
CPR should be to ‘reverse premature death not prolong inevitable
death’ [2].
Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of two
morbidity scores — prognosis after resuscitation score (PAR) and
modified PAM index (MPI) — in predicting failure to survive
following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in our ICU.
Methods We reviewed the records of postoperative cardiac adult
patients who underwent CPR in our ICU from April 1999 to March
2003 at the Georg-August University Hospital, Göttingen,
Germany.
Results During the study period, 169 patients had cardiac arrest
for which CPR was instituted. Eighty (53.7%) survived to
discharge from the ICU and 71 (47.7%) survived to be discharged
from the hospital. The mean time interval until ROSC was re-
established and the duration of CPR differed significantly in
survivors and nonsurvivors (P = 0.008 and P = 0.0002,
respectively). The PAR score identified 77 patients with a score >7
and the MPI score identified 74 patients with a score >7 none of
whom survived to be discharged from the ICU. The sensitivities of
the PAR score and MPI for predicting failure to survive following
CPR were 86.5% and 83.1%, respectively. The PAR and MPI
scores did not incorrectly identify a patient as a nonsurvivor who
subsequently survived.
Conclusion The PAR and MPI scores are useful in identifying
patients in whom CPR may be unsuccessful and could additionally
provide useful information to physicians and patients involved with
decisions about do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders.

resulting in an event-free survival exceeding 75% for most patients
over the past four decades. Modern child leukemia treatment requires
an interdisciplinary cooperation – PICU interventions demand serious
pathological cases with immediate life exposure originated from long-
term haematological treatment: (1) patient’s clinical status impairment
related to aggressive cytostatic therapy (febrile neutropenia, sepsis,
pneumonia, respiratory failure, ARDS, hemodynamic instability,
MODS, MOF, life-threatening bleeding, neurological alterations in the
course of toxic encephalopathy, etc.), (2) postanesthesia intensive
care for complications due to invasive procedures (CVC
implantations) or vital sign decompensation after anaesthesia.
Objective To assess the benefit of early invasive (transfer from
standard hematology to PICU, respiratory and circulation support,
invasive arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure [CVP]
measurement, continuous hemodynamic monitoring [PICO, NICO],
permanent urinary catheter and nasogastric tube insertion) versus
a conservative waiting strategy without invasive procedures when
complications appear during hematology leukemia treatment.
Design Retrospective analysis, n = 29 patients with acute leukaemia
admitted to the PICU because of life-threatening complications
during their hematological treatment, within the years 2000–2004.
Patients and methods Critically ill patients admitted to the PICU.
Twenty-nine children with leukemia, 20 × ALL, 8 × acute myeloid
leukaemia, 1 × chronic myeloid leukaemia, average age 8.7 years
(from 5 months to 18 years), 21 boys, eight girls. All patients were
hospitalized at the PICU 45 times altogether within the period
under consideration (2000–2004) regarding life-threatening events:
postanesthesia care (complicated CVC implantation — haemo-
thorax, pneumothorax), febrile neutropenia, sepsis, septic shock,
respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, acute neurological
deterioration.
Results Twenty-two children (76%) from 29 patients with leukemia
admitted to the PICU survived. Seven children (24%) died (6 × MOF
and septic shock, 1 × fatal intracerebral hemorrhage) — in three of
them (42% mortality rate) it was hesitated for invasive treatment
initiation (conservative waiting strategy). The authors detail the
monitored parameters, clinical patient’s status (PRISM), laboratory
findings, and at the conclusion illustrate the casual report of a 15-
year-old boy with ALL, MODS and septic shock with good outcome
thanks to early invasive treatment and adequate therapy (mechanical
ventilation, invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, CVP
monitoring, continuous cardiac output measurement from the PICO).
Conclusion Although pediatric leukemic patients with severe
sepsis remain at very high risk, recent findings suggest that their
outcomes may be better, as previously reported, using aggressive
and early ICU interventions.

Assessing the poisoning cases being monitored in the ICU
in terms of causes and mortality

Ataturk Training and Research Hospital, Izmir, Turkey
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P386 (doi: 10.1186/cc4733)
Introduction The Medline investigations carried out in recent years
demonstrate that morbidity and mortality caused by acute
poisoning are higher in elderly patients, suicidal attempts and
multiple drug intakes [1].
Method We retrospectively studied a total of 121 poisoning cases
that were monitored in our ICU between January 2002 and July
2005 in terms of causes and mortality.
Results Of the subjects, 55 were poisoned by organophosphates,
18 by multiple drugs, 18 by tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), and 11
by methanol, four by foods and 15 by various types of poisons. In
dead patients the mean age, APACHE II score, and times of
mechanic ventilation (TMV) were higher compared with the
discharged group and their Glasgow Coma Scores (GCS) at
admittance were found significantly reduced from those
discharged (Table 1). While 56 patients were directly admitted to
our hospital, 65 patients were referred. Although there was no
statistical significance in APACHE II scores of those who were
referred, their TMV and length of stay in the ICU were found
statistically significant. It was determined that the rate of female
patients who subjected to multiple medicines and TCA poisoning
was higher and they were younger than other groups. Mortality was
21.8% in the organophosphate group, 5.6% in the multiple poisoning
group, 0% in the TCA group and 54.5% in the methanol group.
APACHE II scores were found significantly higher in the methanol
group compared with the other four groups. A considerably
prolonged TMV was detected in the organophosphate group than
in the multiple drug poisoning and TCA groups. Three of the
patients in the multiple drug poisoning group were those who
received antidepressive treatment previously. Four of the patients
in the organophosphate group had received cardiopulmonary
resuscitation where they transferred and three of these patients
were lost during observation in our ICU. Three of the patients in the
organic phosphate group accidentally took poison (one through
inhalation and two through foods) and all other poisoning cases
were intentional suicide attempts except the methanol and food
poisoning cases.
Table 1 (abstract P386)
Exitus Alive P value
Age 38.15 ± 14.01 31.25 ±14.66 0.028
APACHE II score 21.06 ± 10.96 10.54 ±6.51 0.000
Admittance GCS 6.30 ± 4.11 10.64 ±4.09 0.000
TMV 6.37 ± 6.12 2.75 ± 5.0 0.000
Discussion It was established in the epidemiology study of two
acute poisoning cases reported in Spain that the suicide attempts
related to depressive disorders were predominant in women and
the mortality was high despite advanced life support and antidote
therapy being provided [2]. In our study, old age, lower GCS at
admittance and prolonged admittance time were considered
factors affecting mortality in terms of overall poisoning.
Interestingly, the majority of the patients in the multiple and TCA
poisonings with suicidal intention were younger women who

This abstract presents experience of the Educational Centre of the
MTSL InCor Sao Paulo in training of the various profiles of medical
personnel (medical doctors and medical technicians) that are
employed in the emergency services of the prehospital and
hospital type in Brazil. A period of the last year (2000) when the
Critical Care March 2006 Vol 10 Suppl 1 26th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine
S163
Educational Centre was restructured, becoming one of the most
active services in the medical sector of the MTSL in Brazil, has
been emphasised in particular. The Educational Centre was
participating in a number of international projects related to
education. Fifty-five courses of the various levels and with different
programs — BLS, ALS, ACLS, ACLS-instructor course, EMT-
course, EMT-advanced course — were carried out in the mentioned
period. Seven thousand six hundred and ten hours of theoretical
teaching and practical training were provided for the 3230
candidates who successfully completed training in various
programs. First-aid training for the civilian population was also
conducted. Two first-aid courses were carried out and successfully
achieved by 64 candidates. In this way, 19 hours of theoretical
teaching and practical training were realised. In order to make first-
aid training popular, 160 children from different institutions were
also introduced to CPR-school and first-aid principles. It has been
pointed out that a well-equipped and trained team for urgent
medical intervention with necessary teamwork is a crucial factor for
the successful treatment of an emergency that involves a patient in
a life-threatening situation.

Background Accreditation has been generally viewed as a
desirable process to establish standards and work toward
achieving higher quality medical care. The worldwide emphasis on
accountability has stimulated dramatic growth in internal quality
management programs, external benchmarking with comparative
data and accreditation for healthcare facilities. There are few
published data about the effects of an accreditation process on
ICU performance. The aim of this study was to describe the effects
of an accreditation process in a surgical ICU.
Methods In this retrospective cohort study we considered two
different periods, the first one (October 2003–September 2004)
as the pre-accreditation (PA) period and the second one (October
2004–September 2005) as the accreditation period (A). We
obtained demographic data, APACHE II score, ICU-mortality rate,
LOS, ICU-acquired infection rate, invasive procedure-related
complication rate and number of training hours per staff member.
We compared these variables between the PA and A periods
using the Wilcoxon test.
Results We included 784 patients in the study: 426 in the PA
period and 358 in the A period. As shown in Table 1 although we
observed a statistical significant increase in APACHE II score and
LOS we were unable to demonstrate any difference in the other
variables between the periods. Also we could observe a trend
toward increasing training hours per staff member as a possible
benefit from an accreditation process.
Conclusions Based on these preliminary data we were unable to
demonstrate any benefit from the implementation of accreditation
standards in ICU routine daily practice. A trend toward increasing
training hours could be observed. Whether an accreditation
process has a positive impact on ICU performance is a question
that remains to be answered.

Introduction Recombinant human activated protein C (APC)
(Drotrecogin-alfa activated) was licensed for the treatment of
severe sepsis following the large randomised controlled trial,
PROWESS [1]. Subgroup analysis of PROWESS and the
subsequent ADDRESS [2] study have shown that only the sickest
patients (at least two organ failures or APACHE II score >25)
benefit from APC. Treatment is associated with an increased risk
of serious bleeding, and so the use of APC is contraindicated in
patients at high risk for this complication. The cost of using APC is
high, both financially and in terms of possible adverse effects, thus
appropriate patient selection is crucial. Upon European Licensing
in 2002, the South East London Critical Care Network (SELCCN)
successfully bid for funding to use APC on the understanding that
the hospital Trusts would provide regular usage reports.
Objective To collect post-licence surveillance data of APC use in
severe sepsis across a network of six ICUs (SELCCN). To certify
adherence to agreed prescribing guidelines, and to monitor
outcome (mortality), adverse events and financial data, thus
ensuring best clinical practice and continued funding.
Methods Guidelines for APC were agreed by the SELCCN. A
reporting tool and supporting database reflecting these guidelines
was designed and implemented to prospectively collect clinical
and financial data. The collated data were reported monthly and
progress was discussed at local and network meetings.
Results Data were collected and analysed for 249 patients from
November 2002 to June 2005. A total of 87% of patients met the
agreed criteria for APC with an average expenditure of €7658 ±
€3451 per patient. During treatment, 30 haemorrhagic events
were cited with four reported as serious. Of those receiving APC,
126 (51%) where discharged home, 85 (34%) died in the ICU and
nine (4%) died as post-ICU patients. Forty per cent of patients with
≥4 organs in failure at the time of APC administration were
discharged home. Funding was retrieved in at least one site for all
patients who received APC.
Discussion These results demonstrate that it is possible to
develop and ensure excellent adherence to consensus guidelines
for the use of a high-cost, life-saving drug. A simple reporting tool
allowed easy monitoring of selection criteria, patient outcome, and
adverse events across the critical care network. The data show
favourable patient outcome especially in those with ≥4 organs in
failure (40% surviving) when compared with the average survival
(19.4%) of a similar group of patients as measured in 91 ICUs

Critical care costs per patient-day are inversely related to
the annual admission rate

Introduction The Critical Care National Cost Block Programme
collects annual cost data for staff, consumables, and clinical support
services. We postulated that larger critical care units reduce the
overall running costs (independent of capital expenditure) compared
with their smaller counterparts.
Methods Data were analysed for the financial year 2003–2004
relating to all 80 critical care units in the Cost Block programme.
Regression analysis was performed comparing the cost per
patient-day with the unit size. Following this, stepwise regression
analysis was used to assess the individual components of cost to
identify the elements (medical, nursing, consumables and other)
most strongly related to admission number.
Results Figure 1 shows the data relating ICU size (defined as
number of admissions per year) with average costs per patient per
day. The daily costs per patient were reduced by €53 for every
100 admissions increment. Analysed for the individual components
that contribute to the daily cost per patient, we found that nursing
costs (€22.3 per 100 admissions increment, P = 0.019) and
consumables (€14 per 100 admissions increment, P = 0.003) had
the strongest impact. Medical and other costs had lower impacts
(€8.9 and €7.5, respectively).
Conclusion The cost per patient per day is higher for smaller units
than that for larger units. There appears to be an economy of scale
for larger critical care units relating mainly to a reduction in daily
nursing and consumable costs. A previous study examining the
data for the financial year 2000–2001 also suggested that there
was an association between the cost per patient day and the ICU
size [1].

Bedside teaching in intensive care: effect on attitudes and
skills of fourth-year medical students
M Zijnen, J Bakker
Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P391 (doi: 10.1186/cc4738)
Introduction A shortfall of intensivists in the future is expected.
Therefore increasing interest early in the medical training could
increase the number of ICU trainees. In addition many medical
students have no clear image of what intensive care is all about.
Although an orientation in the ICU is part of many medical school
curricula worldwide, little is known on the impact of these
programs.
Materials and methods Fourth-year medical students attended a
2-hour bedside teaching course in intensive care where
observation, hemodynamics and organ support were the main
topics. Nurses and medical staff participated actively in the course.
All students (n = 193, 135 females) attended the program and
192 students completed pre-course and post-course 5-point Likert
questionnaires (scale 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree).
Data are presented as the mean ± SD. The Mann–Whitney test
was used to compare responses before and after the teaching
program. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results Overall attitudes towards the ICU as well as self-reported
skills improved significantly following the course. Interest to qualify
as an intensivist increased significantly (P = 0.002). Also fewer
students pictured the ICU as a typical drama-series ICU following
the course (P < 0.001). In addition the students felt they could
better describe the organization and structure of the ICU team
following the course (2.9 ± 0.8 vs 4.0 ± 0.6, P < 0.001). The self-
reported ability to identify and qualify organ failure and
hemodynamics improved significantly, i.e. the ability to calculate
the mean arterial pressure increased from 2.9 ± 1.1 to 4.3 ± 0.9 (P
< 0.001). Students reported no emotional/coping problems
associated with the visit to severely ill patients. One medical
student was involved in acute circulatory arrest of a patient. The
majority of the nurses were positive on the involvement in this
training program and also the burden to their day-to-day clinical
work in relation to the experienced positive effect was limited.
Conclusion A 2-hour ICU orientation in the undergraduate
curriculum based on adult learning principles was successful in
increasing interest for the profession, improving understanding of
the ICU organization as well as improving the ability to recognize
vital organ functions and principles of the monitoring of critically ill
patients.

Benchmarking procedural competence in paediatric
intensive care using cumulative sum analysis: intravenous
access, arterial lines and intubation
M McDougall, A Durward, S Tibby, I Murdoch
Guy’s and St Thomas NHS Trust, London, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P392 (doi: 10.1186/cc4739)
Objectives There are no benchmarks for assessing competence
for paediatric intensive care (PICU) procedures such as peripheral
(PVL), central venous (CVL), and arterial cannulation (ART) and
intubation. We evaluated PICU trainee competence using the
cumulative sum analysis method (CUSUM) against data published
for elective anaesthetic procedures in adults [1,2]. Our objective
was thus to document whether the suggested procedural failure
rates for adults are applicable in PICU and the number of cases
required to achieve procedural competence.
Method We prospectively recorded outcome for procedures (PVL,
CVL, ART, intubation) performed in a tertiary PICU by residents
(n = 6) and fellows (n = 10) over a 4-month period. A successful
procedure was defined as: PVL = cannulation with two or less
punctures at a single site, CVL = cannulation with two or less
punctures at a single site in 10 min, ART = cannulation with two or
less punctures at one site within 10 min, and intubation = endo-
tracheal tube entry into the trachea on the first attempt with two or
less laryngoscopy attempts. Change in site or operator was
recorded as failure. Ultrasound was used in 8% of CVL insertions.
The CUSUM method calculates a weighted score for each
procedure using predefined acceptable (p0) and unacceptable
failure rates (p1). Success is weighted as s = [log(1 – p1) / (1 –
p0)] / {[log(p1 / p0)] + [log(1 – p1) / (1 – p0)]} and failure as (1–
s). The cumulative sums of these values are plotted on a time chart
with an upward slope indicating failure (1– s) and downward slope
success(es) for each group (residents and fellows). Competence
is defined as the point where the downward slope crosses the
lower control limit using an α and β error of 0.1.
Results Eight hundred and seventy-six procedures were perfor-
med on 561 patients (mechanical ventilation 82%, inotropes 27%.)
Median (IQR) age 6.3 months (1.1–34), weight 6.4 kg (3.3–13.6)
and PIM2 score 2.9 (1.3–7.2). Thirty-four per cent of procedures
were performed by residents and 66% by fellows. The number of
procedures required to achieve competence for each group is
shown in Table 1, with residents not achieving competence for any
procedures except PVL insertion. Fellows failed as a group to gain
competence for CVL insertion. Figure 1 contains the CUSUM plots
for ART insertion by fellows and residents (group plot).
Conclusion The suggested procedural failure rates for adults (PVL
20%, CVL 5%, ART 20% and intubation 5%) are applicable in the
PICU setting. Competence was achieved by PICU fellows within
27–36 procedures, except for central line insertion that may be
improved by routine use of ultrasound guidance. A 4-month period
does not provide PICU residents with sufficient exposure to gain
competence for the central venous and arterial cannulation and
intubations.

Introduction Iatrogenic complications (IC) are defined as an
adverse event that occurs independently of the underlying disease.
In fact, in the USA, IC is noted in 4% of hospitalised patients
leading to death in 14% of cases.
Objectives To evaluate the incidence and types of IC in ICU, their
repercussions on morbidity and mortality rates, and to identify the
associated factors of risk.
Materials and methods A prospective study, performed between
February 2002 and June 2003. All episodes of IC are recorded.
The type, the cause and the repercussions are noted. IC was
divided, according to their consequences, into categories: major,
moderate and minor.
Results Two hundred and forty-three patients are enrolled with
mean age 45 ± 19 years, sex ratio = 1.8, SAPS II = 34 ± 18, LOD =
6.5 ± 3.75, OMEGA score = 126 ± 228. Fifty-four per cent
needed mechanical ventilation. Two hundred and fifty episodes of
IC occurred in 91 patients. Incidence was 37.5% and a density of
incidence of 231/1000-day stay in the ICU. Cardiovascular
complications are the most frequent ones, including mainly
hypotension and arrhythmia (40.8%). The incidence was judged

major in 67 cases. Risk factors retained are age under 60 years,
prognosis indices (SAPS II, APACHE II) and length of stay. The
mortality is 45% in the event of IC and 28.75% without this.
Discussion IC are frequent, they are induced by the development
of invasive techniques of investigation and monitoring, human error
and a high or excessive nursing workload. Their pathogenesis is
related to the acute disease and the characteristics of the ICU.
Conclusion To decrease IC incidence, human and material
resources must be optimised and the indications of invasive
investigations and monitoring must be more rigorous.

Iatrogenic complications in ICU patients

Introduction and objective Iatrogenic complications in the ICU
are inevitable and often lead to medical emergencies. They may
affect the clinical course of patients by increasing morbidity and
mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate frequency, types,
severity and morbidity of complications associated with medical
and nursing practice, to determine possible risk factors and to
suggest efficient protective measures for reducing the risk.
Patients and methods Eighty-four adult patients were included in
the study over a 12-month period. An iatrogenic complication was
defined as an adverse effect that was not associated with the
patients’ underlying disease. Two ICU physicians who assessed all
complications monitored patients during their entire hospitalization
and a 6-month follow-up. Drug interactions and their adverse
effects were excluded.
Results Ninety-nine iatrogenic complications were recorded in 42
of the 84 admissions. Although 58 (39%) complications were
considered as major, none was directly associated with the death
of a patient. Major complications included respiratory distress,
severe hypotension, pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac arrest and
bacteremia. Eighty-five per cent of the complications were due to
human errors while misused and default material were considered
the cause of the rest. Patients with a higher APACHE II score
experienced more complications (25 ± 5.9, P = 0.027). The
subgroup of patients admitted to the ICU with more than two
organ failures had also a higher risk for an iatrogenic complication
(P = 0.045). The age of the patient, excessive nursing workload as
well as the number of complications were the most important
prognostic factors (P = 0.022, P = 0.015, P = 0.056, respectively)
for persistent morbidity. Patients without complications had a 2.89-
fold higher possibility of survival compared with those with
complications. Days in the ICU and APACHE II score were
statistically significantly lower in these patients (P < 0.0001).
Conclusions Iatrogenic complications were common and
associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates. Human
errors accounted for the majority of them, and were often
associated with high nursing workload. The elderly and the
severely ill patients are at greater risk of presenting a major
complication. To increase safety, preventive measures should be
taken. Better organization of the daily workload, better training of
the medical and nursing staff as well as avoidance of invasive
monitoring, wherever this is possible, could contribute to decrease
iatrogenic complications.

Introduction Quality indicators are working tools that permit
measurement of the medical care provided. They can provide
warning signs and identify problems or improvements and
departures from standard care.
Objectives The Spanish Society of Intensive Care and Coronary
Units (SEMICYUC) developed a Strategic Plan that included the
drawing up of quality indicators for key processes in the care of
critically ill patients.
Materials and methods Over a 2-year period, the 14 working
groups of the SEMICYUC drew up a consensual list of 120 quality
indicators. The methodology was coordinated and supervised by
the Avedis Donabedian Foundation (FAD). The initial phase was
the definition of the process and identification of the most
important aspects according to priority criteria. The design phase
consisted of the description of the various sections of the indicator
in order to ensure its validity and reliability (definition, dimension,
justification, formula, explanation of terms, population, type, data
sources, standard and commentaries). All these process were
based on the best scientific evidence available and expert opinion.
Results A total of 120 quality indicators, covering all areas and
dimensions of intensive care medicine, were drawn up. Of these,
20 were considered important enough to recommend their
monitoring in all ICUs: (1) Early administration of acetylsalicylic
acid (ASA) in acute coronary syndrome. (2) Early reperfusion
techniques in acute coronary syndrome with ST elevation. (3)
Semirecumbent position in patients with invasive mechanical
ventilation. (4) Prevention of thromboembolic disease. (5) Surgical
intervention in head trauma with epidural and/or subdural
hematoma. (6) Monitoring of intracranial pressure (IPC) in severe
head trauma with pathological CAT. (7) Pneumonia associated
with mechanical ventilation. (8) Early management of sepsis/septic
shock. (9) Early enteral nutrition. (10) Prophylaxis of gastro-
intestinal hemorrhage in patients with invasive mechanical ventila-
tion. (11) Adequate sedation. (12) Management of analgesia in
nonsedated patients. (13) Inadequate transfusion of blood concen-
trates. (14) Real donors. (15) Compliance with hand-washing
protocol. (16) Information for the families of ICU patients. (17)
Therapeutic limitations. (18) Survey of perceived quality at
discharge from the ICU. (19) Round-the-clock presence of
intensive care specialists in the ICU. (20) Register of adverse
effects.
With respect to the type of indicator included: five were structural,
79 were procedural and 36 were concerned with results. The
principal quality dimensions evaluated in the indicators were: risk
(53); effectiveness (42); adaptation (25); efficiency (10);
satisfaction (seven); continuity of care (three) and accessibility
(one), although the majority evaluated more than one dimension of
quality.
Conclusions This project led to the drawing-up of 120 quality
indicators of the key processes in the care of the critically ill
patient. Twenty basic indicators were identified that we consider
should be monitored in all ICUs, with the other indicators
depending on the case mix. According to these indicators, the
dimensions monitored with greatest frequency are risk and
effectiveness.

Quality–efficiency square: a new way to look at cost and
quality in critical care
M Blunt, K Burchett, P Young
Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King’s Lynn, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P396 (doi: 10.1186/cc4743)
Critical care units are under increasing pressure to account for the
large cost of managing complex patients. Ideally, cost-utilisation
analysis (€/QALY) [1] should be used to assess treatment; how-
ever, this is very difficult in the uncontrolled environment of a work-
ing critical care unit with a heterogeneous patient population. Cost/
survivor is often used as a cost measure that considers outcome
and is easier to measure; however, this is case-mix dependent so
comparisons between units are flawed. We aimed to develop a
measure of cost efficiency and quality that was independent of
factors outside the control of each unit. We postulated that this
could be achieved using a cost factor based on patient days
weighted for average risk of death (RoD) and annual admission
number [2], which along with the SMR would allow construction of
a matrix that could assess both cost efficiency and outcome quality
(the QES).
Forty-seven units from the UK National Cost Block Programme
(2003–2004) were included. Regression analysis was used to
create a formula for cost/patient-day based on the admission number
and RoD. Residuals representing the deviation from the predicted
cost were plotted against the SMR. Units that had both low SMR
and low cost (<95% CI) were considered to have high quality and
high economy or high quality–efficiency (QE). Those with high SMR
and high cost were considered to have low QE. We identified seven
units that had high QE and six units that had low QE.
We categorised units by cost/survivor and then assessed the QE
categories in these terms. There was only limited correlation
between the two methods.
We believe that the QES is a relatively easy measure of both
economic efficiency and quality, and may be a useful, powerful and
convenient tool to assess critical care units.

Influence of second-generation and third-generation
mobile phones on critical care medical equipment

Introduction The restricted use of cellular phones in patient areas
in hospitals seems hard to enforce considering the growth in use
and the decrease in size of these devices. The electromagnetic
incompatibility of the first-generation mobile phones (i.e. GSM)
with medical equipment has been described. Information on the
safety of new mobile communication technology (second-generation
GPRS and third-generation UMTS) is scarce. A recent paper
showed minor interference with GRPS and UMTS suggesting
improved safety with new networks [1].
Objective We hypothesized that GPRS and UMTS have adverse
influences with clinical relevance on critical care equipment.
Methods Sixty-one medical devices used in the critical care
environment were tested (i.e. nine ICU ventilators, 13 critical care
monitors, seven syringe and four volumetric pumps, five hemo-
filtration/dialysis equipment). All were tested during full operation; a
simulator was connected if necessary. A signal generator (HP/Agilent
E4433B/ESG-D Digital RF) was used to generate the GPRS signal I
and II (with different time slot durations both at carrier frequency 900
MHz) and the UMTS signal. Their power level was controlled at 2 W
for GRPS and 0.2 W for UMTS, corresponding with maximal transmit
performance of cellular phones in daily practice. The distance from
the antenna to device during the tests varied from 500 to 0 cm.
Incidents were classified according to an adjusted critical care
adverse events scale: ‘hazardous’ (direct physical influence on patient
by unintended change in equipment function), ‘significant’ (influence
on monitoring significant level of attention needed with distraction
from patient care) or ‘light’ (influence on monitoring significant level of
attention needed without distraction from patient care).
Results A total of 49 incidents were found in 26 devices (43% of
all tested devices). Seventeen incidents were classified as
‘hazardous’, 20 as ‘significant’ and 12 as ‘light’. The hazardous
incidents occurred in 26% with GPRS-1, in 6% with GRPS-2 and
in 2% with the UMTS network. Hazardous incidents occurred at a
median distance of 3.0 (0–300) cm.
Conclusions Despite safety requirements of electronic medical
equipment as stated in international standards, ICU devices are
still vulnerable for electromagnetic interference by new-generation
wireless telecommunication technology. Restricted use of cellular
phones in ICUs is still warranted.

Background A strategy of daily-routine chest radiographs (CXR) is
practiced in many ICUs, although its efficacy remains controversial.

Figure 1 (abstract P396)
S168
The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and
therapeutic efficacy, as well as the costs of the daily-routine CXR,
and compare this with CXR that were judged clinically necessary
(‘on-demand CXR’).
Materials and methods In this prospective, blinded, controlled
study, daily-routine CXR were obtained from all patients in a mixed
surgical–medical ICU in a university-affiliated teaching hospital. CXR
were evaluated by trained radiologists (to score for the presence of
predefined items such as progressive or new infiltrates,
pneumothorax, malposition of the tube/lines); CXR were not
accessible for intensivists. In addition to these ‘daily-routine CXR’,
the intensivist ordered ‘on-demand CXR’ if deemed necessary. In all
these cases, a specific form had to be completed with reasons for
CXR and suspected abnormalities. Considerable worsening
according to predefined criteria on the ‘routine CXR’, but not
clinically recognized or suspected, was communicated daily with the
intensivist. From these data, diagnostic efficacy (the number of CXR
with significant abnormality/total number of CXR) and therapeutic
efficacy (number of CXR leading to an intervention/number of CXR)
were calculated. Chi-squared analysis was used to test differences.
Results During 4 months, 1063 CXR in 153 patients were obtained
(725 ‘daily-routine’ CXR and 338 ‘on-demand’ CXR). Diagnostic
efficacy of ‘daily-routine’ CXR was 6.3%; diagnostic efficacy of ‘on-
demand CXR was 21.9% (P < 0.0001). Therapeutic efficacy of
‘daily-routine CXR’ was 2.6%; therapeutic efficacy of ‘on-demand’
CXR was 21.3% (P < 0.0001). The most frequent interventions on
the basis of CXR findings were the administration of diuretics (20%)
and repositioning of the tube (18%). A potential CXR volume
reduction of 36% was observed when the ‘routine CXR’ strategy
would have been replaced by an ‘on-demand CXR’ approach. This
amounts to a potential cost reduction of €82,000 per year.
Conclusion The value of the ‘daily-routine CXR’ is low. Based on
these preliminary data, daily-routine CXR should probably be
abandoned for ICU patients.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P399 (doi: 10.1186/cc4746)
Background There has been some controversy as to whether
physiotherapy causes adverse physiological changes (APC) that
could be harmful to intensive care patients.
Aims and method A multicentre study in six Australian tertiary-
level ICUs was performed to investigate the incidence of APC
during physiotherapy in critically ill patients over a 3-month period,
to benchmark this against studies that have recorded spontaneous
APC, and to investigate whether there were any trends in patient
category, demographic characteristics, type of intervention, or
seniority of physiotherapist.
Results There were 12,800 physiotherapy treatments completed,
with 27 treatments resulting in adverse physiological changes
(0.22%). This incidence was significantly lower than a previous
study of APC (663 events/247 patients over a 24-hour period);
that is, the incidence during physiotherapy was lower than during
general ICU care. Significant factors were apparent, with a
decrease in blood pressure or arrhythmia the major APC noted in
patients on medium to high doses of inotropes/vasopressors,
having unstable baseline hemodynamic values, previous cardiac
co-morbidities, receiving intervention consisting of positive
pressure (two-sided Fisher’s exact test P = 0.07), or right-side
lying (two-sided Fisher’s exact test P = 0.006).
Conclusion This study has demonstrated that the overwhelming
majority of physiotherapy treatments in intensive care are safe, but
further factors should be investigated in controlled trials.

Three generations of mortality prediction models: accuracy
for outcome prediction in the critically ill obstetric patient
Z Haddad1, C Kaddour2
1Groupe Hospitalier Pitié Salpêtrière, Paris, France; 2National
Institute of Neurology, Tunis, Tunisia
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P400 (doi: 10.1186/cc4747)
Introduction Mortality prediction models (MPM) [1-3] are generalistic
severity of illness scoring systems. No score is computed, and a
logistic regression equation directly provides a probability of hospital
mortality. Three generations of MPM scores are already available, and
assess mortality at admission to the ICU (first hour).
Objective To determine the accuracy of the different MPM
systems in the critically ill obstetric patient.
Patients and methods Prospective data collection of the
parameters to calculate MPM1-H0 and MPM2-H0 [1,2], and
retrospective chart review of one of two additional parameters
necessary to calculate MPM3-H0 [3] from the MPM2-H0 score
[2]. Study period: January 1996–December 2003. Inclusion
criteria: all obstetric patients hospitalized in a multidisciplinary ICU
and with a length of stay >1 hour. Exclusion criteria: same as those
published in the original references [1,2].
Performances of the three systems were compared, using the area
under the receiver–operator characteristic curve (AUROC) to
assess the discriminatory power and the Hosmer–Lemeshow (HL)
goodness-of-fit test for calibration. Data was computed on R
version 2.1. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results See Table 1.
Table 1 (abstract P400)
MPM1 MPM2 MPM3
AUROC 0.801 0.853 0.885
HL 0.036 0.156 0.37
Discussion and conclusion There is no significant difference in the
performances of MPM2 and MPM3. They are clearly better than the
oldest model. The two new parameters included in the MPM3 did not
significantly influence the performance of the system. Many reasons
could explain these findings: when computing the MPM3 system,
addition of a ‘zero–factor’ term [3] for patients with no risk factors other
than age does not improve model performance in our population,
because our database is composed of young woman issued from a
homogeneous case mix. The fact that the ‘Full Code’ factor was
assessed retrospectively and that we deal with young pregnant
patients where very few Do Not Resuscitate orders were given
explains that this parameter got little influence. We can conclude that
MPM1 is outdated, and MPM3 tends to be better than the previous
version without having a statistically significant difference. Adding
known prognostic factors not included in MPM systems could have
enhanced performances of MPM3 in our particular case mix.

Expanded Multiple Organ Dysfunction score: is it better
than the Sequential Organ Failure Syndrome score?
Z Haddad1, C Kaddour2, N Baffoun2, L Skandrani2

Institute of Neurology, Tunis, Tunisia
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P401 (doi: 10.1186/cc4748)
In our database, the day 1 Sequential Organ Failure Syndrome
(SOFA) score performs significantly better than day 1 Multiple
Organ Dysfunction score (MODS) in outcome prediction (data not
published). The Expanded Multiple Organ Dysfunction score
(EMODS) is a simple modification of MODS. It is calculated by
summing up MODS with the Organ Support/Failure Score (OS-F).
The OS-F is a dichotomous score of 1 or 0, given to each organ
support/failure the patient received, namely: mechanical ventilation
present at the 24th hour of admission, inotropes for more than 1
hour/day, transfusion and serum creatinine >200 µmol/l. The
Maximum score a patient could receive is 4. The above
modifications seem necessary for MODS as it does not account
for therapeutic interventions.
Objective To compare performances of EMODS with SOFA in
outcome prediction.
Design Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data as
part of the APRiMo study [1].
Patients and methods All critically ill obstetric patients admitted
to our independent multidisciplinary ICU were included. Exclusion
criteria: length of stay <24 hours. Necessary data for calculation of
the MODS, SOFA and OS-F Score at the first day of ICU
hospitalization were available. Main outcome of interest: vital status
at ICU discharge. Performances of EMODS and SOFA were
assessed using adequate statistical tests.
Results Six hundred and forty patients were included in the
analysis. Mortality rate 13.3%. Mean age 31 ± 6 years. Mean
length of stay 5 ± 5 days. Mean MODS 4.3 ± 3.8, mean SOFA
score 4.9 ± 4.2, mean EMODS 5.1 ± 4.6. Nonsurvivors vs
survivors: mean SOFA score 11.5 ± 4.9 vs 3.9 ± 3 (P < 0.001),
mean EMODS 12.3 ± 4.9 vs 3.9 ± 3.8 (P < 0.001) (Table 1).
Table 1 (abstract P401)
ROC Hosmer–Lemeshow
MODS 0.9 ± 0.07 0.004

EMODS 0.922 ± 0.05† 0.290
*P < 0.05 MODS vs SOFA; †P < 0.01 EMODS vs MODS.
Discussion and conclusion EMODS sensitivity was significantly
better than MODS and performed at least as well as the SOFA
score. Adding organ support enhanced the performance of
MODS, sustaining organ dysfunction/failure assessment with
SOFA (which involves mechanical ventilation and use of inotropes)
is a better way to evaluate respiratory and hemodynamic
dysfunctions. The choice of transfusion as an additional criterion to
assess hematologic dysfunction is pertinent in our particular case
mix. After computing a logistic regression model with OS-F
components, single-component MODS, with vital status as the
dependent variable; a serum creatinine level >200 µmol/l gave an
OR of 23. This emphasizes again the importance of acute renal
failure as a prognostic factor in the ICU, but also rises again the
question about the optimal parameter to evaluate renal organ
dysfunction.

Value of APACHE II score to predict mortality in
cardiogenic shock patients of a cardiologic ICU
M Ribeiro, R Carvalho, J Bastos, A Fagundes Jr, H Araujo,
L Kopel, S Lage
Heart Institute (Incor) University of São Paulo, Brazil
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P402 (doi: 10.1186/cc4749)
Introduction APACHE II score was primarily designed to predict
mortality in general patients in ICUs. In patients with specific
diseases (such as severe trauma, COPD and acute pancreatitis),
however, other score systems were more sensitive
Hypothesis The aim of this study was to establish the value of the
APACHE II score in predicting mortality of patients with cardiogenic
shock admitted to a cardiologic ICU of a university hospital
Methods This was a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort
observational study of 84 patients with cardiogenic shock admitted
to a cardiologic ICU. Clinical and laboratory data to calculate the
APACHE II score were recorded on admission. The outcome
measure was mortality. Logistic regression was used to estimate
the predictive ability of the APACHE II score, and the chi-square
test was used to compare the difference between predicted and
observed mortality.
Results Patients had a mean age of 54 ± 20 years, 65.5% were
male, ICU length of stay was 17.3 ± 20.2 days, mean ejection
fraction (EF) was 25 ± 5% and mean APACHE II score was
15 ± 6. Observed mortality was 62% and the corresponding
APACHE II prediction was 21.9%. There was a significant
difference between observed and predicted mortality (P < 0.001).
Conclusions These data show that mortality in cardiogenic shock
cannot be predicted by the APACHE II scoring system. In this
population new assessment tools should be determined for better
outcome prediction.

Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P403 (doi: 10.1186/cc4750)
Objective To determine the pattern of organ failure in critically ill
cancer patients and whether the SOFA score is useful in
predicting outcome.
Methods Six hundred and two consecutive admissions (369
males, 233 females) from July 2004 to September 2005 were
prospectively studied in a 21-bed ICU-HDU. Two hundred and
sixty-three patients were admitted following surgery (Group 1),
209 patients with solid tumours were admitted from the wards
(Group 2) and 130 had haematological malignancies, lymphoma or
myeloma (Group 3). Mean SAPS II was 36.0 ± 9.4. Length of ICU
stay was 5.2 ± 6.6 days. Parameters for calculating the SOFA
score were assessed daily until ICU discharge. The total SOFA
score on day 1 (SOFA1), the highest SOFA score of the first 3
days (MAX3) and during the ICU stay (MAXSOFA), the change in
SOFA score between day 2 and day 1 (DELTA1) and the
MEANSOFA (total SOFA score for all days/days in ICU) were
calculated. Organ failure was present if the score for any organ
was >2 in the first 48 hours.
Results ICU mortality was 33.6% (11%, 36% and 75% for
Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively, P < 0.000). Nonsurvivors had
higher organ scores and SOFA score on day 1 (6.3 ± 4.1 vs 1.7 ±
2.1, P < 0.001) and until day 7. Respiratory (RS) failure was the
most common (17.1%), followed by coagulation (11.8%), central

nervous system (CNS) failure (8.8%), cardiovascular (CVS) failure
(7.8%), renal and liver failure (3.5% and 2.5%; P < 0.000). The
incidence of RS, coagulation, CVS and CNS failure on day 1 was
very high in Group 3 (40%, 38%, 19% and 16.2%, respectively)
and least in Group 1 (5.3%, 1.1%, 1.9% and 3.4%, P < 0.000).
Patients in Group 3 had significantly higher SOFA1 (6.6 ± 4.0 vs
3.5 ± 3.4 for Group 2 and 1.4 ± 2.0 for Group 1, P < 0.000), and
scores for all organ systems on day 1. Of the organ failures
developing within 48 hours, CVS failure was associated with the
highest mortality (86.3%), while RS failure and coagulation failure
were associated with mortality of 68.9% and 75.6%, respectively.
Group 1 patients had significantly less mortality with RS (30%),
CNS (30%) and coagulation (50%) failure compared with the
other groups. A total 13.6% of patients with no organ failures
within 48 hours died, while patients with one, two, three and >3
organ failures had a mortality of 51.3%, 73.3%, and 92% and
100%, respectively. For patients staying >1 day, the area under
the ROC (SE) for SOFA1, DELTA1, MEANSOFA, MAXSOFA and
MAX3 were 0.81 (0.02), 0.65 (0.03), 0.91 (0.02), 0.91 (0.02) and
0.87 (0.02), respectively. The univariate ORs (95% CI) were
highest (1.9 [1.7–2.1] and 1.6 [1.5–1.7]) for MEANSOFA and
MAX3, respectively, and lowest (1.4 [1.2–1.6]) for DELTA1.
Conclusions Patients with haematological malignancies have a
higher incidence of coagulation failure and worse outcome with
multiple organ failure compared with general ICU patients. The
MEANSOFA best discriminates between survivors and
nonsurvivors, while SOFA1 and MAX3 were superior to DELTA1.

Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P404 (doi: 10.1186/cc4751)
Introduction The performance of a prognostic score must be
validated before it may be used in an ICU, especially where there is
a specific patient case mix.
Objective To validate a cancer-specific ICU scoring system – the
ICU Cancer Mortality Model (ICMM) [1] – and to compare its
performance with that of a general ICU scoring system – APACHE II.
Methods Six hundred and two consecutive admissions (369
males, 233 females, mean age 50.3 ± 14.1 years) from July 2004
to September 2005 were prospectively studied in a 21-bed ICU-
HDU. To hundred and sixty-three patients were admitted following
surgery (Group 1), 209 with solid tumours were admitted from the
wards (Group 2) and 130 had haematological malignancies,
lymphoma or myeloma (Group 3). In case of multiple ICU
admissions during a single hospital admission, data from the last
ICU admission were recorded. Discrimination was determined by
computing the area under the receiver–operating characteristic
curve (AUC, represented as area ± SE). Calibration was calculated
using the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test.
Results The average APACHE II score was 15.3 ± 9.8, and ICU
length of stay (LOS) 5.2 ± 6.6 days. Predicted mortality in hospital
was 24.8% by APACHE II and 50.3% by ICMM. Two hundred and
eleven patients died in hospital (observed mortality 35.0%),
yielding a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.4 and 0.7,
respectively. Both APACHE II and ICMM discriminated well (AUC
0.90 ± 0.013 vs 0.87 ± 0.016, respectively). Both scoring systems
calibrated poorly (APACHE II, ^H 59.0, P < 0.001, df = 10 and
ICMM, ^H 97.6, P < 0.001, df = 10). The mean APACHE II score
in Group 1 (8.6 ± 5.8) was significantly lower (P < 0.001) than in
Groups 2 (17.9 ± 8.5) and 3 (24.9 ± 7.9). Mortality was 11%,
39% and 77% in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The SMR for
Group 1 was 1.19 for APACHE II and 0.32 for ICMM; for Group 2,
1.36 and 0.72, respectively; and for Group 3, 1.54 and 1.02.
APACHE II showed better discrimination than ICMM in Group 1
(AUC 0.86 ± 0.04 vs 0.79 ± 0.04) and calibrated well for Group 1
(^H = 14.9, df = 10, P = 0.14).
Conclusion Both APACHE II and the cancer-specific ICMM
discriminated well but were poorly calibrated, and could not be
validated for use in our patients. APACHE II worked well for a
subgroup consisting of surgical patients with a lower severity of
illness, while the ICMM tended to better for patients with
hematological malignancy with a high severity of illness and mortality.

Severity of disease and infection were related to bad
outcomes of elderly patients in a general ICU

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P405 (doi: 10.1186/cc4752)
Background Elderly patients (≥70 years old) are progressively
more frequently admitted to ICUs. Studies addressed to evaluate
short-term and long-term outcomes of the elderly were not
conclusive about the effect of age as a predictor of bad outcomes.
This study was designed to evaluate our experience in managing
elderly patients admitted in our 21-bed medical–surgical ICU.
Objective To evaluate which of the patients’ characteristics and
interventions were related to outcomes in elderly patients admitted
in a general ICU.
Methods A prospective cohort study, including all consecutive
patients (n = 788) admitted from December 2003 to December
2004. Variables included for analysis were: demographic,
diagnosis, severity scores at entrance; intervention issues during
ICU stay: TISS28, organ dysfunction, mechanical ventilation,
vasoactive medication, procedures, clinical infection and
complications; outcomes recorded were: ICU and hospital length
of stay, ventilator-days, mortality. Elderly patients’ characteristics
and outcomes were compared with the less old (<70 years old).
Results The elderly were 426 (54.06%) patients and the less-old
group was 362 (45.93%). Characteristics of the elderly compared
with the less-old group were: no differences in gender; higher
ultimately fatal and fatal underlying disease (8.2% vs 4.4%, P <
0.02 and 18.3% vs 14.4%, P < 0.02, respectively); higher
APACHE II score (15.95 ± 6.35 vs 12.08 ± 6.7, P < 0.001); more
frequent infection disease at admission (33.1% vs 24.9%, P <
0.01) and sepsis (19.0% vs 13%, P < 0.02). During the ICU stay
there were a higher use of inotropic agents (36.9% vs 29.6%, P <
0.03) and no significant differences in the use of sedation, dialysis,
insulin, recombinant human activated protein C, surgery and
nutritional therapy. There was no difference in SOFA score at ICU
discharge between groups (1.58 ± 3.3 vs 1.49 ± 3.9, P < 0.74).
More important bad outcomes were observed in the elderly group
compared with less-old patients: higher mortality rate at ICU
(15.7% vs 9.1%, P < 0.009); higher mechanical ventilation-days
(3.97 ± 12.7 vs 2.45 ± 6.38, P < 0.001); higher nosocomial
sepsis rates (12.4% vs 8.8%), but not significant (P < 0.108). The
hospital stay after ICU discharge was higher in the elderly group
(11.4 ± 17.3 vs 7.7 ± 11.7 days, P < 0.002), as well as hospital
discharge rates being lower (69.2% vs 83.4%, P < 0.001). Age
separately was not significant as a predictive factor of bad outcome
(OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.19–2.90, P < 0.005) in univariate analysis.
Critical Care March 2006 Vol 10 Suppl 1 26th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine
S171
Conclusions Age separately was not predictive of bad outcomes.
The sum of ICU therapeutic interventions was not discriminative for
outcomes between elderly and less-old patients. Severity of illness
and infection at admission were determinant of bad outcomes in
the elderly patients.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P406 (doi: 10.1186/cc4753)
Introduction Traumatic brain injury is a potentially fatal condition
and a common cause of admission to ICUs in the United Kingdom.
We describe the case mix and outcomes of head injury patients
requiring intensive care and evaluate the ability of five risk
prediction models to predict mortality in these patients.
Method Secondary analysis of a high-quality clinical database, the
Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre Case Mix
Programme Database, on 374,594 admissions to 171 critical care
units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland from 1995 to 2005.
Calibration of risk prediction models was assessed by the area under
the receiver–operating characteristic curve (AUROC), discrimination
by the Hosmer–Lemeshow (H-L) C statistic and the intercept and
slope from Cox’s calibration regression, and overall fit by Brier’s score.
Results A total of 11,021 admissions following traumatic brain injury
were identified (3% of all admissions). The mean age was 44 years
and 77% were male. Mortality was 23% in the ICU and 33.5% in the
hospital. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) length of stay in the
ICU was 3.2 (1.1–8.1) days for survivors and 1.6 (0.7–4.0) days for
nonsurvivors. Median (IQR) length of stay in hospital was 24
(10–51) days for survivors and 3 (1–9) days for nonsurvivors. SAPS
II, MPM II and the ICNARC model discriminated best between
survivors and nonsurvivors and were better calibrated than APACHE
II and III in 5393 patients eligible for all models (Table 1).
Table 1 (abstract P406)
Model AUROC H-L C Cox intercept, slope Brier
ICNARC 0.84 24.9 0.17, 1.08 0.147
MPM II 0.81 38.2 0.20, 1.04 0.163
SAPS II 0.81 61.4 0.02, 0.89 0.158
APACHE II 0.74 215 –0.26, 0.66 0.187
APACHE III 0.76 2478 0.50, 0.61 0.194
Conclusion Traumatic brain injury requiring intensive care is
associated with a high mortality rate with a short ICU length of stay
in nonsurvivors. APACHE II and III have poorer calibration and
discrimination than SAPS II, MPM II and the ICNARC model in
predicting mortality in these patients.

Background Outcome prediction has become increasingly
important over time, either to evaluate quality of care or to make
therapeutic decisions. The APACHE II and SAPS 2 scores are
widely used tools to assess prognosis among ICU patients.
Nevertheless, there are still conflicting data concerning the best
instrument to be used in specific groups of patients.
Objective To compare the performance of APACHE II and SAPS
2 in a cohort of clinical patients.
Design A prospective cohort study in a 19-bed ICU in a private
hospital.
Patients All clinical patients admitted to the ICU during the period
of the study.
Measurements and results There were 527 patients admitted
between September and November 2005. Seventy-nine (15%) of
them were admitted for clinical reasons, and 56 (70.8%) had
simultaneous measurement of the APACHE II and the SAPS 2
scores. The mean APACHE II and SAPS 2 were 20.87 ± 10.27
and 39.09 ± 14.59, respectively. Nine patients died (3.7%). The
mean APACHE II and SAPS 2 in the survivors and nonsurvivors
were 18.09 ± 7.94 and 35.44 ± 8.86 (P < 0.0001), and 35.36 ±
12.33 and 58.56 ± 9.08 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The area
under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.960 (95% CI 0.910–1.010)
for the APACHE II score, and 0.934 (95% CI 0.869–0.998) for the
SAPS 2 score. Using a cutoff value of 51 points for the SAPS 2,
sensitivity was 100%, specificity 88.4%, positive predictive value
(PPV) 64.3% and negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%.
Using a cutoff value of 25 points for the APACHE II, sensitivity was
100%, specificity 91.5%, PPV 69.2% and NPV 100%. The OR for
an APACHE score >25 was 3.25 (95% CI 1.44–7.34), and for
SAPS 2 >51 was 2.8 (95% CI 1.39–5.66). The association of
both scores increases the specificity to 97.9% and PPV to 90%,
maintaining the sensitivity and NPV of isolated scores, increasing
the OR to 10 (95% CI 1.59–64.20).
Conclusion In this cohort of clinical patients, the association of
SAPS 2 and APACHE II scores is a better predictor of mortality
than the isolated measurements.

Background The prediction of mortality in the ICU is very
important to evaluate the quality of the care for our patients. The
two most used scores that are used are the APACHE II and the
SAPS 2, but there are conflicting results in the literature regarding
which of them is the best predictor tool.
Objective To compare the performance of both scores to predict
mortality in a surgical ICU in Brazil.
Design A prospective cohort study in a 19-bed medico-surgical
ICU in a private hospital.
Patients All patients admitted to the ICU over a period of 4 months.
Measurements and results Between September and November
2005, 527 patients were admitted in the ICU. Of those, 187
(35.5%) had simultaneous assessment of the APACHE II and the
SAPS 2 scores. The mean APACHE II and SAPS 2 scores were
13.47 ± 5.93 and 26.09 ± 13.94, respectively. There were seven
deaths (3.7%). The mean APACHE II and SAPS 2 in the survivors
and nonsurvivors were 13.24 ± 5.63, 19.29 ± 10.05 (P = 0.062),
and 25.07 ± 12.73 and 52.43 ± 18.31 (P = 0.001), respectively.
The area under the ROC curve was 0.887 (95% CI 0.743–1.032)
for the SAPS 2. The best cutoff value was 39.5 points, and the
sensitivity and specificity were 85.7% and 88.9%, respectively.

The SAPS 2 mean predicted mortalities for patients with score <39.5
and ≥39.5 were 6.31 ± 0.48% and 48.7 ± 7.5%, respectively.
However, the observed mortality in the patients with SAPS 2 score
<39.5 and ≥39.5 were 0.6% and 23.1%, respectively.
Conclusion In the studied population, SAPS 2 is a better tool to
predict mortality than APACHE II. However, the mortality was
overestimated by this score.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P409 (doi: 10.1186/cc4756)
Objective The main aim of the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)
is promoting qualified care with the objective of achieving the best
results and better prognosis for critically ill children. One means of
comparing the quality and efficacy of care provided at a given unit
is made by risk adjustment systems. The principal scores that have
been developed for the pediatric population are the Pediatric Risk
of Mortality (PRISM) and Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) scores.
Our aim in this study was to compare the commonly used pediatric
mortality risk scoring systems and to assess the feasibility of using
these scoring systems in developing countries
Methods The cohort study conducted prospectively in an eight-bed
tertiary medical PICU in University Children’s Hospital from
December 2002 to July 2004. The scoring systems compared were
PRISM III-12, PRISM III-24 and PIM-2. Observed and expected
mortality were compared by the Lemeshow–Hosmer goodness-of-fit
χ2 test. Mortality was also standardized for case mix using the
standardized mortality ratio (SMR). Mortality discrimination was
quantified by calculation of the area under the receiver–operating
characteristic curve.
Results During the study period, 334 patients enrolled to the study.
Eighty-four (25.7%) of the 334 patients studied died. Estimated
mortality by PRISM III-12 was 38.71 with a standardized mortality
rate of 2.17, by PRISM III-24 was 46.99 with a standardized mortality
rate of 1.78, and by PIM-2 was 32.4 with a standardized mortality
rate of 2.45. The Hosmer–Lemeshow test gave a chi-square of 31.1
(P < 0.001) for PRISM III-12, 21.2 (P < 0.001) for PRISM-III 24, and
34.6 (P < 0.001) for PIM-2. The area under the ROC curve was
0.80 in PRISM III-12, 0.85 in PRISM III-24, and 0.76 for the PIM
model. Only 9.3% (n = 31) of the patients was admitted electively to
PICU. The presence of mechanical ventilation (38% vs 7%, P <
0.01) and the existence of chronic organ disease (50% vs 24%, P <
0.001) were significantly associated with mortality.
Conclusion The PIM test was less well calibrated overall. PRISM
III-24 offers better capacity for discriminating between survivors
and nonsurvivors in our country. We observed an underestimation
of mortality in every scoring system. The underestimation of
mortality may be associated with the existence of high proportion
of chronic organ disease in our PICU.

Surgical Procedure Assessment score predicts ICU length
of stay in cardiac surgical patients

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P410 (doi: 10.1186/cc4757)
Introduction With a high volume of cardiac surgical patients,
effective allocation and prediction of the use of limited ICU beds is
essential. We developed the Surgical Procedure Assessment
(SPA) score (see Table 1) as a simple preoperative tool to assess
ICU needs for cardiac surgical patients. After a pilot study (182
patients), we applied this score to a larger prospective cohort to
test its association with ICU length of stay (LOS).
Methods SPA scores were assigned preoperatively to all patients
undergoing cardiac surgery during 2002 at a single center. All
patients were admitted to either the cardiothoracic or surgical ICU
following surgery and data were collected prospectively during the
hospitalization.
Results A total of 1201 patients were enrolled. The mean age was
64 years (SD ± 14.2) and 66% were male. There was an increase
in median length of stay for each step increase in the SPA score
(1A: 1.1 days; 1B: 1.3 days; 2A: 1.6 days, 2B: 3.0 days, 3: 9.6
days), which was statistically significant (P < 0.01 Cuzick’s
nonparametric test for trend) (see Fig. 1).
Conclusion There is a strong correlation between the
preoperatively assigned SPA score and ICU LOS for patients
undergoing cardiac surgery. This simple, easily assigned score
may provide an efficient method for improving cardiac surgery
scheduling and allocation of ICU resources.

Methods Prospective collection of demographic, clinical and
laboratory data of 330 consecutive patients admitted to the
postoperative care unit following elective and emergency surgical
procedure, for a 6-month period. The ASA score was assessed
preoperatively, the POSSUM score was calculated preoperatively
and postoperatively, and the SAPS II and SOFA score were
computed for the first 24 hours postoperatively. The outcome
measure was inhospital mortality. Receiver–operating characteristic
(ROC) curve analysis was used to estimate the predictive ability for
inhospital mortality of the various scoring systems.
Results Among the 330 patients admitted to the PACU, 14 were
transferred to the ICU after an interval of time varying from
24 hours to 9 days. The median length of stay in the PACU was 3
(1–17) days. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was 0.78
for SOFA score, 0.63 for POSSUM, 0.57 for ASA, and 0.67 for
SAPS II. The cutoff values were 7 for SOFA, 47 for POSSUM, 3
for ASA and 21 for SAPS II scores. The observed mortality rate
was 3.6%, while expected mortality rates according to POSSUM,
ASA and SAPS II scores were 6.8%, 6.2% and 5.4%, respectively.
Conclusions Our study suggests that SOFA score might be
useful to predict outcome in the PACU surgical patients. The
POSSUM, ASA and SAPS II scores overestimate inhospital
mortality rates for surgical patients admitted to the PACU. The use
of organ failure scores might improve the power of predictive
scores in these patients.

Stability and Workload Index for Transfer score predicts
unplanned medical ICU patient readmission

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P412 (doi: 10.1186/cc4759)
Introduction Unplanned readmission to the medical intensive care
unit (MICU) is associated with worse outcome. Unfortunately, the
ability to predict which patients are likely to deteriorate after MICU
dismissal is limited. We developed and tested a numerical index
that measures and quantitates suitability for patient transfer from a
critical care unit to a general services care environment (Stability
and Workload Index for Transfer [SWIFT] score).
Methods We identified consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary
care MICU from May 2004 to May 2005. The primary outcome
was unplanned readmission to the MICU or unexpected death on
the floor precluding ICU readmission. Utilizing a nursing workload
database, an APACHE III database, a computerized medical
record and a hospital laboratory database, we extracted
information related to patient functional status, severity of illness
and the demand for specific nursing interventions. Multivariate
logistic regression was used to determine the association between
specific risk factors and MICU readmission.
Results We evaluated 1131 patients during 1242 hospital
admissions, 100 of whom were readmitted to the MICU and five
died unexpectedly on the floor. Elements of the SWIFT score
include: ICU length of stay, ICU admission source, day of
discharge Glasgow Coma Scale, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and the nursing
demand for complex respiratory care. The SWIFT score predicted
ICU readmission more precisely (ROC curve AUC 0.75) than the
day of discharge APACHE III score (AUC 0.62) or day of
discharge APACHE III predicted hospital mortality (AUC 0.66).
Conclusions The initial SWIFT score work has delineated a
universally available set of parameters that acceptably correlate
with risk of MICU readmission. If validated in an independent
sample, the SWIFT score may improve the precision of MICU
patient transfer decisions.

Modified early warning system scoring and critical care
readmission
G Kemp, J Carr, T Jones, G Dempsey
University Hospital Aintree, Liverpool, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P413 (doi: 10.1186/cc4760)
Introduction Modified early warning systems (MEWS) have been
developed in an attempt to address suboptimal patient manage-
ment prior to critical care admission [1]. The use of MEWS scoring
as a predictor of critical care readmission has not been described
previously.
Patients and methods We have reviewed MEWS scores from all
critical care discharges, from a 17-bed mixed medical/surgical
critical care unit in a university teaching hospital, assessed by our
outreach service from November 2004 to June 2005. Two hundred
and thirty-eight patients were reviewed, with MEWS scoring being
performed routinely at critical care discharge and at outreach
review 24 hours later.
Results Of the 238 patients reviewed, 197 underwent uneventful
critical care discharge and did not require further admissions.
Forty-one patients required readmission to critical care due to a
deterioration of their presenting problem. The two groups of
patients were well matched with respect to age, sex,
medical/surgical split and admission Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation II score. The was no difference between
the groups with respect to MEWS score at critical care discharge.
MEWS score on outreach review, 24 hours after critical care
discharge, was significantly higher in those patients requiring
critical care readmission (Table 1).
Table 1 (abstract P413)
Readmission? Discharge MEWS (SD) Outreach MEWS (SD)
No (n = 197) 0.8 (1.2)* 0.7(1.3)**
Yes (n = 41) 0.9 (1.1)* 3.5 (3.0)**
*P = 0.4 MWU test; **P < 0.001 MWU test.
Conclusion MEWS scoring at critical care discharge does not
predict critical care readmission. MEWS scoring by the Critical
Care Outreach Team 24 hours after discharge, however, appears
to predict the need for critical care readmission.

Can we distinguish patients at risk of deterioration?

Track and trigger scores such as the Modified Early Warning System
(MEWS) score are currently used in many hospitals throughout the
United Kingdom. Calculating the scores for only those patients judged
to be ‘at risk’ may potentially miss patients who actually are at risk.
We carried out a survey in our hospital looking at which patients
were having their MEWS scores calculated, and therefore judged
to be at risk of deterioration, and compared their MEWS scores
and outcome (inpatient mortality) with those who were not having a
formal scoring system carried out. For those patients not being
scored we carried out the appropriate observations to enable a
MEWS score to be calculated.
Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/10/S1
S174
We reviewed 389 patients; four patients were on care of the dying
pathways and were excluded. Of the remaining 385, 89 (23%) had
a MEWS score calculated. The difference in mortality was
calculated using a chi-square test. Table 1 shows our results.
Mortality figures were available for 373 patients. Overall mortality
for those patients having MEWS calculated was 13/84 (15.5%),
while for the other group mortality was 31/289 (10.7%) (NS).
From these data it would appear that we are not able to predict
which patients are at risk of dying and many patients not scored
were sicker than expected. It may therefore be prudent to calculate
MEWS scores for all patients who are having observations carried
out, which may enable us to identify those patients who are
beginning to deteriorate, and institute measures to prevent this.

Background Physiological track and trigger warning systems (TTs)
use periodic observation of vital signs (tracking) with
predetermined criteria (trigger) for requesting attendance of a
senior clinician or critical care outreach team (CCOT). There has
been a proliferation of such systems in recent years, but with little
formal evaluation. There is no clear evidence identifying an ideal
system for timely recognition of critically ill patients.
Objective To assess the ability of different TTs to predict patient
outcomes within and across hospitals, in different age groups,
wards and specialties. To identify the best TT for timely recognition
of critical illness.
Methods Cohort study of data from 31 acute NHS hospitals in
England and Wales. Participants varied by data source;
predominantly all patients seen by CCOT or all patients on
selected wards. Patient outcome was a composite of death,
admission to critical care, ‘do not attempt resuscitation’ or
cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Primary assessment was by
sensitivity and positive predictive value, secondary assessment by
specificity and negative predictive value.
Results Fifteen datasets met predefined quality criteria and were
included. Sensitivity and positive predictive value were low with
median (quartiles) values of 43.3 (25.4, 69.2) and 36.7 (29.3,
43.8), respectively. Specificity and negative predictive value were
generally acceptable, with median (quartiles) values of 89.5 (64.2,
95.7) and 94.3 (89.5, 97.0), respectively. Within hospitals there
were differences in the discrimination of TTs in relation to age,
ward and specialty, but these were not consistent across hospitals.
Conclusion We were unable to establish the best existing TT or
develop a new high-quality TT for timely recognition of critical
illness due to wide variation in the datasets. Sensitivity of existing
TTs is very low, meaning that a high number of patients requiring
intervention are likely to be missed if clinicians rely solely on these
systems for identifying deteriorating patients. The low sensitivity
may be due, in part, to sudden deterioration and infrequent
measurement of vital signs. It is probable that using a TT improves
identification of critical illness but it should be used as an adjunct
to clinical judgment. The challenge is to increase the sensitivity of
TTs while maintaining acceptable specificity.

Objective To evaluate risk factors and outcomes in patients with
liver transplantation who were readmitted to our ICU after liver
transplantation during their hospital stay.
Design A 15-year retrospective study.
Patients A total of 152 (102 male and 50 female) patients
admitted to our ICU after liver transplantation over a 15-year period
(1990–2004).
Results Of the 129 patients who survived the first ICU stay after
liver transplantation, 28 patients (17 male and 11 female) (21.7%)
were readmitted. The mean age was 44 ± 14.3 years, SAPS II
score of first ICU admission and readmission were, respectively,
37 ± 7.1 (predicted mortality 39.4%) and 41.3 ± 10.8 (predicted
mortality 47.6%). SAPS II score for non-readmitted (NREAD) ICU
patients was 32.9 ± 5.8 (predicted mortality 31.7%). The recipient
age was similar between readmitted (READ) and NREAD patients.
Child–Pugh class C was 71% for NREAD and 82.2% for READ
patients. The time between extubation and ICU discharge was 1.4 ±
0.7 days. Early readmission (<48 hours after ICU discharge)
occurred in 25% of READ patients. Causes of early readmission
were acute respiratory failure (ARF) 42.8%, cardiac disorders
28.5% and gastrointestinal (GI) surgical complications 28.5%.
Causes of late readmission (days between first ICU admission and
readmission was 17.8 ± 13.8) were ARF 43.3%, cardiac disorders
6.7%, GI surgical complications 36.6%, sepsis 6.7%, CNS
complications 6.7%. First ICU stay was 5.1 ± 6.1 days for READ
patients and 3.8 ± 3.3 days for NREAD. Readmission ICU stay
was 6.25 ± 5.9 days. ICU mortality for READ patients was 42.8%.
Three-month mortality was 68% for NREAD patients and 76.8%
for READ patients.
Conclusion The results of this study provide evidence that READ
patients appeared to be sicker than NREAD and they had longer
length of first ICU stay. Cardiopulmonary complications were the
main cause of early or late readmission, and the ICU and 3-month
mortality was higher for patients readmitted to the ICU after liver
transplantation.

Objective To determine risk factors and outcomes in critically ill
patients who were readmitted to the ICU during their hospital stay.
Setting A general ICU of a tertiary community hospital.
Patients and methods We retrospectively analysed ICU
readmissions between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2004.
The data analysed included patients’ clinical characteristics,
APACHE II, SOFA score, TISS-28, length of ICU stay, ICU and
hospital mortality.
Results During the study period, 735 patients were admitted to
the ICU. Among patients who survived (467 patients), 42 patients
(27 male, 15 female) (9.03%) were readmitted. The mean age was
53 ± 17.7 years. The prevalent cause of readmission was
respiratory and cardiovascular complications (63.61%) followed by
sepsis (12.22%), surgical problems (11.74%), neurological
disorders (7.34%) and miscellaneous (5.09%). Patients whose
neurological and respiratory disorders were the main admission
reasons in the ICU had the highest readmission rate. APACHE II
on first admission was estimated for non-readmitted patients
(NREAD) (21 ± 7.5) and for readmitted patients (READ) (24 ±
6.6) (predicted mortality was 37%, and 47%, respectively), while
initially admitted READ patients required less need of organ
support than at the time of readmission (SOFA score was 8.0 ±
3.3 and 9.5 ± 3.5 respectively). Patients needed more therapeutic
procedure at readmission than at their first ICU admission (TISS-
28 on first ICU admission was 31 ± 5.4 and at readmission was
35.3 ± 5.6). The ICU mortality in READ patients was 42.7% and
their hospital mortality was 65.7% (NREAD hospital mortality was
52.8%). The time between extubation to ICU discharge was 1.42
days (±0.79), the median interval between first ICU discharge and
readmission was 3.97 days (12 hours–14 days), while 11 patients
(26.19%) were in need of the ICU less than 48 hours after
discharge.
Conclusion Patients with neurological and respiratory disorders
were at greatest risk of requiring ICU readmission. Respiratory and
cardiovascular complications were the major reasons for
readmission. The readmitted patients appeared to be sicker and
they had a higher risk of hospital death than non-readmitted
patients. Probably, if an intermediate ICU was available in our
hospital, the readmission rate in ICU would be visibly lower.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P419 (doi: 10.1186/cc4766)
Objective To describe the trend in the severity of illness and
hospital mortality rate of patients admitted to the ICU over a 10-
year period.
Methods This retrospective study involves the analysis of a
prospectively collected APACHE III database of patients admitted
to the ICUs of a tertiary medical center from 1995 to 2004. We
created a customized logistic regression model for predicting
hospital mortality and calculated the severity of illness and the
standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for each year of the 10-year
study period.
Results Excluding patients who did not authorize their medical
records to be reviewed for research and readmissions, 46,618
admissions were included in the study. The mean (SD) first ICU
day APACHE III score was 47.2 (25.5). The overall hospital
mortality rate was 9.7%. The area under the curve (95% CI) for the
customized model was 0.871 (0.866–0.876) and the Hosmer–
Lemeshow statistics was 30. The average (95% CI) predicted and
observed mortality rates and SMR for each year of the study period
are presented in Table 1.

Introduction Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a frequent cause of
admission to ICUs and usually necessitates mechanical ventilation
(MV). Knowledge about the incidence, mortality, and risk factors
associated with patients that require MV is essential to improve
outcomes.
Objectives To determine the characteristics, risk factors prior
and/or during MV, and general and specific mortality rates in
patients under MV in a general university ICU in southern Brazil.
Methods A prospective cohort of 400 adult patients admitted to
the ICU who needed MV for at least 24 hours, between March
2004 and April 2005. Data were collected daily, for up to 28 days.
The age, gender, APACHE II score, medical or surgical patients,
causes for the requirement of MV, organ dysfunction/failure
developed prior to MV and during MV, ventilatory parameters,

duration of MV, modes of MV, tracheostomy and duration of
weaning were some variables studied. Univariable and
multivariable analysis were performed.
Results The incidence of MV was 18.5%; the overall and specific
mortality rates were 9.4% and 57.0%, respectively. The mean
(±SD) age was 67.4 ± 8.6 years; 51% were males; the mean
APACHE II was 29.1 ± 23.9; the mean duration of MV was 10.4 ±
7.4 days. A multivariable analysis indicated that age (P < 0.001),
MV duration (P = 0.02), vasoactive drug use (P = 0.01), acute
lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (P =
0.002) and renal failure (P = 0.05 – borderline) occurring during
the MV period were independently associated with death.
Conclusions The risk factors associated with mortality in 28 days
(age, MV duration, vasoactive drug use, ALI/ARDS, and renal
failure during MV) are similar to some literature studies. The overall
and specific mortality rates were higher. Final conclusions will
require evaluation of the mortality rates of specific pathologies,
planned when our sample size will be increased. The identification
of these factors may allow early interventions to improve
therapeutic strategies.

Introduction In Germany about 90,000 patients survive sepsis per
year. Few data are available indicating quality of life and chronic
pain states of sepsis long-term survivors [1].
Methods One hundred and fifty-two patients were approached
who survived severe sepsis or septic shock (ACCP/SCCM) on our
ICU. In order to obtain specific information about chronic pain
states, these patients received the SF 36 as well as the Brief Pain
Inventory (BPI) questionnaire, an instrument asking for different
aspects of pain intensity and pain-associated functional
interference. Data are presented as the mean ± SD. The norm
scores of the SF 36 on subtest levels were compared with the
scores of our sample. For statistical analysis t tests have been
used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results Sixty-four patients, 43 males and 21 females, returned the
questionnaires. The mean age was 62 ± 15 years. SF 36 items
concerning bodily pain occurred in septic survivors significantly
more frequently compared with the healthy normal population
(49.4 ± 29.9; norm: 79.1 ± 27.4; P < 0.0001). In most of the BPI
items, patients scored over 3 on an 11-step numeric rating scale (0 =
no pain, 10 = worst possible pain). This limit is thought to
differentiate between low pain on one side and the need for
treatment on the other. For example, 44% of the patients reported
a maximal NRS value of 0–3, but 56% a maximal value of 4–10
(mean: 4.1 ± 3.4). Mean values of pain-associated functional
interference ratings were (0 = no interference, 10 = worst possible
interference): general activity: 4.2 ± 3.1; mood: 3.4 ± 3.0; walking
ability: 4.5 ± 3.5; work: 5.1 ± 3.5; relationship: 3.1 ± 3.1; sleep:
3.7 ± 3.0; enjoyment of life: 3.7 ± 3.1.
Discussion Differences in quality of life were previously evaluated
in adult survivors of critical illness investigating general ICU
populations compared with healthy controls [1]. We focused on
chronic pain states in patients who survived severe sepsis or
septic shock. Here, we found highly significant differences in the
pain-associated domain of SF 36 between survivors of severe
sepsis or septic shock compared with the German healthy
population. Furthermore, the interference due to pain was revealed
to be high in septic survivors. Underlying reasons remain unclear
and need to be evaluated. One potential contributing factor may be
the proinflammatory cytokine response in sepsis that has been
shown to increase pain in experimental settings.
Conclusion In conclusion, we could reveal that quality of life in
long-term survivors of severe sepsis or septic shock was impaired
in comparison with the German healthy population. For the first
time, we demonstrated additionally a higher incidence of pain in
these patients.

Significance of the qualified psychotherapeutic care in the
PTSR development

Introduction Kuzbass is the largest industrial region of the mines,
heavy metallurgy and transport industry, which governs the high
level of traumatism increase, twice as large as the national level.
Treatment of patients with severe trauma was directed to the
physical state in most cases. The psychogenic factor is not spared
by attention. It is known that instantly or in a short time period after
the physical trauma there are the different psychic disorders
connected with stress in most people.
Objective The analysis of the factors’ role in the complex study of
the endured traumas’ consequences (head injuries, fractures of the
locomotor system, burns), occurring in extreme situations. The
problem’s actuality is conditioned by the necessity for social
psychological adaptation of the patients.
Materials and methods We examined the patient group with
different traumas occurring in extreme conditions. The patients
suffered from the sleep disorders, anxiety, affective and other
psychopathologic disorders apart from the main pathology. All
patients received psychological care from relatives, medical staff,
and social organizations. However, during all periods of
hospitalization psychotherapy was included in the rehabilitation
complex program only in some of the patients. Furthermore, we
observed dynamically two patients groups. The psychotherapy
specialist worked in the first group, whereas in the complex
treatment of the second group psychotherapy was not included.
Results Most patients of the first group lose many symptoms of
the psychic disorders. The second group demonstrated various
dynamics. We observed a reduction of the psychopathological
disorders in one part of the patients, and their development with
formation of the PTSR signs, adaptation disorders and specific
phobias in other part. Some members of the patients’ families had
nerve psychic disorders.
Conclusions Analysis showed that the psychological support of
nonspecialists is important but it is not adequate in the different
traumas occurring in extreme cases. The circumstances of the
trauma require qualified psychotherapeutic care not only to the
patient, but also to the members of his/her family.

Objective To determine long-term survival and quality of life of
patients treated in the SICU due to sepsis or trauma.
Design An observational study in an 11-bed closed SICU at a
860-bed general hospital during a 1-year period (January 2003–
December 2003).
Patients and methods Patients were divided into two groups
according to admission diagnoses: group 1, sepsis or group 2,
trauma (polytrauma, multiple trauma, head injury, spinal injury).
Quality of life was assessed after 2 years following intensive care
admission using the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire.
Results A total of 164 patients (66 trauma patients and 98
patients with sepsis) were included in the study. Trauma patients
were younger compared with patients with sepsis (53 ± 21 years
vs 64 ± 13 years, P < 0.001). There was no statistical significant
difference between both groups in APACHE II score and length of
stay in the SICU. Trauma patients were hospitalized longer in the
general ward (35 ± 44 days vs 17 ± 24 days, P < 001).
SICU survival, hospital survival and 2-year survival were lower in
the sepsis group compared with the trauma group (60% vs 74%,
42% vs 62% and 33% vs 57%, respectively, P < 0.05). Long-term
mortality of the sepsis and trauma groups were higher compared
with the age-matched healthy population (nine times vs six times,
respectively).
There was no statistically significant difference in quality of life in all
five dimensions of EQ-5D between groups: almost 70% of patients
had pains, 62% mobility problems, 50% signs of depression.
Conclusion Patients with sepsis treated in the SICU have higher
short-term and long-term mortality compared with trauma patients.
However, quality of life is reduced to the same level in both groups.

Background Mortality in burn patients can be predicted by three
risk factors: age ≥ 60 years, total burned surface area (TBSA)
≥ 40%, and presence of inhalation injury. According to the formula
of Ryan [1], patients with zero, one, two or three of the above risk
factors, have a mortality rate of 0.3%, 3%, 33% and 90%.
Objective Evaluation of the predictive value of the risk factors as
proposed by Ryan in Belgian burn patients.
Methods We retrospectively analysed all patients admitted
between 1999 and 2004 to the six Belgian burn units.
Results During the study period 6227 patients were admitted. The
annual incidence rate of severe burn injuries admitted to the burn
unit was 10.11 per 100,000 inhabitants. The median age was 34
years (IQR: 16.0–48.0). The median TBSA was 5% (IQR:
2.0–15.0). Inhalation injury was present in 574 patients (9.2%).
Overall mortality was 4.6%. When zero, one, two or three risk
factors were present, mortality was respectively 0.5%, 9%, 43%
and 87%. Table 1 presents outcome for the different combinations
of risk factors.
Conclusion The incidence rate of severe burn injury in Belgium
was low. The risk factors proposed by Ryan were also indicative for
outcome. However, some of these three risk factors were more
important for outcome than others. Also, the combination of
different risk factors influenced outcome considerably.

analysis. The Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit was used to
evaluate the calibration. Discrimination was tested by measuring
the area under the receiver–operating characteristic (aROC) curve.
Results In the period of study 1014 patients were admitted. The
mean age was 46 years (SD 20), 25% was female. The mean
deep burn surface was 14% (SD 19%). Inhalation injury was
diagnosed in 33%. Mechanical ventilation was required in 44%.
Median length of stay in the unit was 9 days (interquartile range: 2,
24). Overall mortality was 15%. Factors associated with mortality
are presented in Table 1. The obtained model had a satisfactory
calibration (Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness of fit χ2 = 10.49; P =
0.10) and an excellent discrimination (aROC: 0.94; 95% CI:
0.90–0.98; P < 0.001).
Conclusions In our cohort of burn patients we observed a
mortality of 15%. Factors associated with mortality were: age,
deep burn surface, inhalation injury and mechanical ventilation.

Background Logistic regression techniques evidence that the
Baux Score, the Edlich Burn Score, and the Zawacki Score highly
correlate with burn patient survival [1]. All these scoring systems
put significant weight on the size of burns and the patient’s age.
The Baux Score is a summation of these two variables. The
presence of inhalation injury has also been recognized as another
risk factor [2].
Objective The mortality rate of the patients hospitalized in our unit
was studied for the past 7 years (1999–30 November 2005).
Results For the period a total of 1887 patients were entered into
the cohort, corresponding to a yearly average of 270 ± 36
patients. Yearly cohorts were compared for age, total burn surface
area (TBSA) and incidence of inhalation injury, and were found to
be matched for all three parameters (Fig. 1). The mean age range
was 34–39 years, TBSA ranged between 9.9% and 12.3%,
inhalation incidence between 6% and 11%. The overall mortality
rate decreased during the time period considered (from 4.8% to
2.8%, r2 = 0.69) (Fig. 2).
Conclusion The global mortality rate in the whole cohort compares
favourably with the Ryan study [2]: 4.1% (67/1665) vs 3.7%
(70/1887) in this study. It should be emphasized that there is an
improving trend over the 7 years, and that this improvement was
mainly achieved among the most severe burns (Baux Score >100)
(Fig. 3). This also highlights the need for a burn registry to
objectively measure the quality in burn treatment.

Introduction Patients recovering from critical illness may show
persisting organ dysfunction that could impair functional status
(physical, social, emotional function) with an associated reduced
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The purpose of this study was
to describe the impact of critical illness and intensive care (ICU)
treatment on HRQOL of ICU survivors and to compare their HRQOL
with ICU nonsurvivors and an age-matched normal Dutch population.
Patients and methods A long-term prospective study in ICU
patients admitted to the ICU for >48 hours. Patients or proxies
completed the Short Form 36 (SF-36) in the first 48 hours of
admission, to assess HRQOL in the pre-ICU period. Patients
completed the SF-36 at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, and 3
and 6 months after ICU discharge.
Results Of the 451 included intensive care patients, 252 could be
evaluated 6 months after ICU discharge (40 were lost to follow-up,
159 died). A multidimensional drop in SF-36 scores (all P < 0.001)
was observed during the ICU stay, with a gradual improvement
near to normal functioning at 6 months after ICU discharge. Never-
theless, at 6 months after ICU discharge, physical functioning,
general health and social functioning were still decreased
(P < 0.05) as compared with baseline values, while all dimensions
scores except bodily pain remained lower than in a comparative
normal population (all P < 0.05). Pre-admission SF-36 scores of
ICU survivors were higher compared with ICU nonsurvivors for
seven of the eight dimensions (all P < 0.001; except role-emotional
P < 0.05). Moreover, pre-admission HRQOL in ICU patients was
already lower than in a normal population.
Conclusion This study demonstrates that critical illness has a
strong impact on HRQOL. A sharp multidimensional decline is
followed by gradual recovery towards normal functioning. HRQOL
recovery was, however, incomplete in physical functioning, general
health and social functioning, and in comparison with the normal
population.

Introduction Staying in an ICU is a distressing event that can
influence quality of life (QOL). We compared the QOL of patients
1 month before hospitalization and 6 months later.
Methods The study included all adult patients who stayed for more
than 24 hours in a mixed, 31-bed, medico-surgical ICU of a
university hospital, between 3 June and 13 November 2004.
During their ICU stay, we questioned patients or their relatives
about their QOL (EuroQOL-5D) 1 month before hospital
admission, and collected all their data. Six months after ICU
discharge, we questioned the surviving patients again, by
telephone or by letter, about their QOL at that time and their
memories about the ICU stay.
Results Six months after ICU discharge, 68% of respondents
perceived the general state of their health to be the same as or
better than it had been before hospitalization (P < 0.001). The
global EuroQOL-5D 6 months after ICU discharge was somewhat
lower (i.e. QOL somewhat better) than before hospitalization,
although this was not significant (P = 0.12). Each component of
the EuroQOL-5D (mobility, autonomy, usual activities, pain/
discomfort, anxiety/depression) was the same as or better after
ICU discharge than before hospitalization in the majority of the
respondents (P < 0.001). If necessary, 92% of patients said they
would return to the ICU, 5% would not return and 3% did not know
(P < 0.001). The most common disturbing memory was loss of
orientation in time (36%) and the item perceived as most important
was fear of dying, with a grade of 8 on a scale from 0 to 10.
Conclusion In our experience, the general state of patients’ health
and their quality of life 6 months after hospitalization in an ICU was
the same as or better than 1 month before, in the majority of
respondents. Most patients would agree to be readmitted to the
ICU if necessary. Loss of orientation in time was the most
commonly reported disturbing memory and fear of dying was the
most important item.

Background Conventional wisdom holds that ICUs in the United
States are more likely to admit very elderly patients than ICUs in
many other developed countries. However, adequately represen-
tative datasets upon which this hypothesis could be tested have
been lacking. We therefore compared patient age distributions in a
very large dataset of US and UK ICU patients.
Methods We analyzed a dataset of ICU admissions to 352 adult
general medical, surgical and medical–surgical ICUs in the United
Kingdom and the United States from 1997 to 2004. The dataset
was constructed from the UK Case Mix Programme Database
(Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre, UK) and the US
Project IMPACT database (Cerner, USA). Both databases include
ICUs from a broad mix of hospitals from their respective countries.
All variables used in the final dataset were validated as being
defined and collected similarly in both countries and patients less
than 20 years old were excluded.
Results The cohort consisted of 635,630 admissions, of which
315,118 (49.6%) were admissions to 172 ICUs in the United
Kingdom (excluding Scotland) and 320,512 (50.4%) were
admissions to 180 ICUs in the United States. While the UK
population is slightly older than the US (median age 39.0 vs 36.3),
the median age of admissions to the ICU was 65 years in both
countries (interquartile range: UK 51–75 years; US 50–76 years).
Medical admissions represented 53.1% of all admissions in the
United Kingdom, and 62.9% in the United States. The United
States admitted more elderly medical ICU patients (16.8% vs 9.4%
of cases 80+ years old) (see Fig. 1). For emergency surgery
admissions, a smaller percentage were age 40–60 in the United
Kingdom (20.0% vs 27.1% in the US), and a greater percentage
were age 60–80 (48.1% vs 41.0% in the US); the age distributions
of elective surgery admissions was very similar in the two countries.

S180
Conclusion The overall age distribution of ICU admissions is
similar between the United States and the United Kingdom, but the
United States admits many more very elderly patients with acute
medical conditions. Although this finding could be due to
differences in sampling of ICUs, it most probably represents
differences in admissions decisions in the two countries.

Since most admissions to intensive care are acute, patient flow in
the ICU can hardly be controlled. Furthermore, ICU beds are
costly. Consequently, a shortage of ICU beds is a common
occurrence. However, there is a lack of precise figures describing
the magnitude of this problem. We therefore conducted a survey to
investigate the available ICU resources in Denmark. The survey
consisted of two parts. The first part was a questionnaire sent to
the directors of all ICUs in Denmark. This questionnaire described
the staffing and resources of the ICUs and the perceived
magnitude of the ‘ICU full’ problem. In the second part, bed
availability and occupancy in all Danish ICUs was measured twice
daily in two separate weeks. Furthermore all transfer of patients
due to lack of resources (beds) was recorded.
The total number of ICU beds was 386 during workdays and 354
during weekends, corresponding to 2.1% and 2.0% of the total
number of hospital beds in Denmark. As Denmark has a population of
around 5,500,000, this is about 7 (6.4) ICU beds/100,000
inhabitants. With 49 ICUs in Denmark there were 1386 measuring
points in the second part of the investigation. In 418 instances (30%)
the ICUs were reported to be full, and during these 2 weeks there
was a total of 32 patients who were transferred to other ICUs
because of bed shortage, corresponding to 834 transferrals per year.

Mortality as a measure of lack of ICU availability
P Levin, A Avidan, T Nesher, C Sprung
Hadassah Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P431 (doi: 10.1186/cc4778)
Background Patients who need intensive care but are not
admitted to the ICU have a poor outcome, while demand for ICU
beds exceeds supply. Patients dying outside the ICU might include
those for whom ICU care has been refused, and as a result have
had a poor outcome. Examination of patients dying outside the ICU
could therefore reveal the extent to which ICU refusal is associated
with subsequent mortality, and for which patients.
Hypotheses That a request for ICU admission has been made for
a significant proportion of patients dying in non-ICU admission
areas, and that access to ICU care for fatally ill patients is not equal
for all hospital departments.
Methods Over a 6-month period, demographic data were collected
on all patients who died in the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical
Center, Jerusalem, both in and out of the ICU. For those dying
outside the ICU, the treating physicians were interviewed regarding
do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status, requests for ICU admission, or the
reasons why ICU admission was not requested.
Results Overall 366 patients died during the study, 244 (67%)
outside ICUs and 122 (33%) within ICUs. Of the patients dying
outside the ICU, a request for ICU admission was made and
refused for only 18/244 (7%) patients. Of these, six (33%) were
assigned a DNR order. Among the 226 patients for whom ICU was
not requested, 71 (31%) were not DNR. The ICU was not
requested for the following 106 reasons (more than one possible
per patient): poor prognosis (42 [40%]), patient died suddenly or
found dead in bed (33 [31%]), no indication (12 [11%]), severity
of underlying disorders (9 [8%]), advanced age (4 [4%]) and
others (6 [6%]). The treating physicians believed that ICU care
could have been beneficial for 20/71 (18%) of these patients.
Among non-DNR patients dying outside the ICU, 67/71 (94%) were
from medical wards and the remaining four (6%) patients from
surgical wards, as compared with 69/122 (57%) medical and
53/122 (43%) surgical patients among those dying in the ICU (P <
0.0001). The mean age of the patients dying outside the ICU was
70 ± 18 years vs 63 ± 20 years for those dying in ICUs (P = 0.0153).
Conclusion ICU care is requested for only a minority of patients dying
on hospital wards, even when patients are not defined as DNR, and
when the treating physicians believe that this care might be beneficial.
Few surgical patients die outside the ICU (as compared with medical
patients), while patients dying in ICUs are younger.

discharge and would then lead to a selection of deaths with more
risk factors after the introduction of a post-ICU follow-up service.
Methods A retrospective database survey was performed. All
deaths in the year before follow-up were compared with all deaths
after a follow-up service was established. Known risk factors
predicting post-ICU death were compared between both groups of
deaths: age, sex, APACHE scores, LOD scores at discharge, source
and type of admission and co-morbidity. Source of admission was
classified as ward vs nonward and type of admission as acute
surgical vs other. Co-morbidity was classified as present or absent
according to the APACHE system classification of chronic illness.
Differences between means of continuous variables were tested by
Student t test. Differences between proportions were tested by the
method as described by Armitage [2]. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results Twenty-seven deaths were identified in each period. A
total of 16 complete datasets were available for analysis. There
was a trend towards lower mortality after establishment of a follow-
up service (8.76% vs 10.26%). Patients who died after establish-
ment of a follow-up service had undergone significantly more acute
surgery and showed a trend towards higher APACHE and LOD
scores as well as a higher prevalence of co-morbidity.

Manganese and hepatic encephalopathy: a prospective study
I Cicinskaite, D Adukauskiene, V Pilvinis, J Pundzius, L Kupcinskas
Kaunas Medicine University Hospital, Kaunas, Lithuania
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P433 (doi: 10.1186/cc4780)
Introduction We hypothesized that the manganese (Mn)
concentration in the blood in cases of acute liver failure (ALF) and
acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is associated with the Mn
concentration in the liver tissue and cerebral globus pallidum and
could be a marker of hepatic encephalopathy.
Methods Mn blood tests were performed for 129 patients (54
patients of control group, 29 with ALF and 46 with ACLF) admitted
to the ICU from October 2003 to July 2005, and pathological
samples of liver and brain tissues were analyzed from 34 dead
patients whose relatives gave their consent for this procedure (10
of control, 11 of ALF and 13 of ACLF). The Mn concentration in
the vein blood and organs was analyzed by graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectroscopy.
Results The Mn concentration in the blood was significantly
different (P < 0.04) in ALF (0.76 ± 0.06) and ACLF (1.04 ± 0.1)
groups without significant difference between these two groups
and the control group. The Mn concentration in the liver tissue was
significantly different between all groups of patients (P < 0.026):
the biggest one in ACLF patients (7.58 ± 1.0), and the smallest
one in ALF patients (4.17 ± 0,7). The Mn concentration in the
cerebral globus pallidum was also significantly different between
all groups of patients (P < 0.03): the highest one in ACLF patients
(4.17 ± 0.34), and the lowest one in ALF patients (1.71 ± 0.2). No
statistically significant correlation was found between Mn
concentrations in the tissues (P ≥ 0.075) either in ALF or in ACLF
groups of patients.
Conclusion The Mn concentration in the blood was not confirmed
as a marker of hepatic encephalopathy in cases of acute and
acute-on-chronic liver failure.

High thoracic epidural improves postoperative cardiac
outcome in ischemic patients undergoing major abdominal
surgery

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P434 (doi: 10.1186/cc4781)
Background Postoperative cardiac morbidity (PCM) continues to
pose considerable risks to surgical patients. High thoracic epidural
analgesia (HTEA), with its selective blockade of cardiac
sympathetic innervation, has been used for treatment of medically
or surgically refractory angina pectoris. However, its use in patients
with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing noncardiac surgery
has not been adequately investigated.
Objective To investigate the effect of HTEA on PCM in patients
with established CAD undergoing major abdominal surgery as
opposed to a comparable analgesic technique: low thoracic epidural
analgesia (LTEA).
Method After approval, 30 patients with CAD undergoing major
abdominal surgery were included. Before general anesthesia, they
were randomly allocated to receive HTEA or LTEA for both
intraoperative and postoperative pain relief. In addition to
haemodynamic measurements, PCM was investigated by
comparing the preoperative ECG, echocardiography and troponin I

with the postoperative ones done on the first, third and seventh
days. Data are expressed as the mean (SE).
Results Cardiac morbidity was only diagnosed in 13.3% of
patients in the HTEA group (Group I). In the LTEA group (Group II),
53.3% were found to have new ischemic changes and 13.3%
developed postoperative MI. There were no reported cases of
cardiac mortality. The absolute risk reduction was 53.3% and the
NNT was 2.
Conclusion HTEA in patients with CAD undergoing noncardiac
surgery has resulted in a reduced postoperative cardiac morbidity.
It may be worthwhile establishing this technique, unless contra-
indicated, in such patients.

Addition of propofol, midazolam, or haloperidol to
sufentanil for intravenous sedation in the ICU using the
bispectral index

Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P435 (doi: 10.1186/cc4782)
Objective Inadequate sedative techniques may adversely affect
morbidity and mortality in the ICU, and the search for the ideal
sedative agent continues. Combinations of hypnotics and opiates
have become commonly used for sedation. In our study, we aimed
to assess whether the addition of propofol, midazolam, or halo-
peridol infusion decreased or not the sufentanil requirements using
the bispectral index (BIS).
Materials and methods The study was planned in 60 ICU
patients. All patients received 0.5 mg/kg sufentanil i.v. bolus.
Immediately after, Group S received 0.25 mg/kg sufentanil
infusion, Group SP received sufentanil infusion + propofol
25 mg/kg/min infusion, Group SM received sufentanil infusion +
midazolam 0.04 mg/kg/hour infusion, and Group SH received
sufentanil infusion + haloperidol 3 mg/kg/hour infusion for 6 hours.
Average BIS values were kept in the range of 61–80 by
decreasing or increasing sufentanil levels in all groups, and hourly
sufentanil consumption was determined. Hemodynamic, bio-
chemical parameters, and arterial blood gases were determined at
baseline, and were repeated in study hours.
Results There was no significant difference in hemodynamic and
biochemical parameters and arterial blood gases among the
groups. Propofol, midazolam, and haloperidol infusion, when added
to sufentanil infusion, decreased the consumption of sufentanil in
all the measured times (P < 0.001).
Conclusion We aimed to determine the effect of propofol, midazolam,
or haloperidol infusion when added to sufentanil infusion in a short
period of time, and found that propofol, midazolam, or haloperidol
infusion decreased sufentanil requirements in ICU patients.

Remifentanil dosage in critically ill patients is independent
of organ dysfunction
A Kulier, M Sailer, T Meislitzer, A Fellner, A Preininger
University of Graz, Austria
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P436 (doi: 10.1186/cc4783)
Introduction Continuous analgo-sedation of ICU patients with
established opioids is difficult due to unfavorable pharmaco-
kinetics, especially in patients with major organ dysfunctions.
Remifentanil (RF) is more suitable for these patients because of its
short half-life independent of the duration of the preceding infusion
and organ functions. No large observational study has investigated
the influence of multiple organ dysfunctions and old age on the
dosage and duration of RF infusion in critically ill patients.
Methods Set in a general surgical ICU of a university hospital.
Within 28 months, 876 postoperative patients requiring ventilation
received analgo-sedation with a constant low-dose propofol
infusion (1.5 mg/kg/hour) and a variable continuous RF infusion to
a target Ramsay Sedation Score 2–3, until either ventilatory
withdrawal was initiated or sedation regimen was changed after
48 hours. The hourly dosage and total duration of RF infusion, and
the SOFA score were documented. Potential predictors for RF
dosage were evaluated by univariate and subsequent stepwise
multiple regression analysis. Significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results The median (±IQR) SOFA score was 7 ± 4, infusion
duration 16 ± 12 hours, age 70 ± 29 years, mean (±SD) RF
dosage 87 ± 44 ng/kg/min. Neither the total SOFA score or any
single composite organ dysfunction influenced the dosage of RF
infusion (Table 1). However, older patients needed considerably
smaller RF dosages. Patients with multiple organ dysfunction had
prolonged infusion duration, but no change in dosage. After
discontinuation of RF infusion, all patients were awake and
extubated within 1–2 hours.
Table 1 (abstract P436)
SOFA Renal Liver
score dysfunction dysfunction Age
RF dosage P = 0.59 P = 0.11 P = 0.12 P = 0.0002
Infusion duration P < 0.001 P = 0.40 P = 0.001 P = 0.22
Conclusions In critically ill ventilated postoperative patients, even
multiple severe organ dysfunctions do not alter the dosage of
continuous RF infusion. Due to predictable pharmacokinetic
properties and reliably short extubation times, RF may be the most
adaptable and safest choice for these patients. Actual dosages
necessary to provide appropriate analgo-sedation are lower and
therefore less costly than expected, especially in older patients.
Further studies to evaluate a cost–benefit ratio and to afford
dosage recommendations for RF analgo-sedation in ICU patients
are warranted.

Remifentanil versus sufentanyl narco-sedation in a surgical
and medical critical care unit with prevention of narcotic-
induced hyperalgesia: a randomized double blind study
F Meurant
Kirchberg Hospital, Luxembourg
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P437 (doi: 10.1186/cc4784)
Background The authors hypothesized that the efficacy of a
remifentanil-based regimen (R) with prevention of narcotic-induced
hyperalgesia (NIH) [1] by magnesium sulphate (MS), ketamine (K)
or clonidine (C) was greater than that of a conventional sufentanyl-
based regimen (S).
Methods One hundred patients were randomly allocated to
receive a blinded infusion of either R at a rate of 0.15 µg/kg/min
(±0.10 µg/kg/min) (G1: n = 50) or S at 0.35 µg/kg/min (±0.15
µg/kg/min) (G2: n = 50). The opioid infusion was titrated, in the
first intent, to achieve optimal sedation as defined by a Sedation
Agitation Scale (SAS) of 4. NIH in G1 was realised by infusion of
MS (0.008 mg/kg/hour), K (0–8 µg/kg/min) or C (0–0.01 µg/kg/
min) depending on hemodynamic stability. A tramadol open-label
(0.25 mg/kg/hour) infusion was started if additional analgesia was
required. Sedation was performed in all patients with a propofol
infusion (0–6 mg/kg/min). The SAS was maintained between 3

and 4. For statistical analysis a Shapiro–Wilk test, Wilcox test and
a Student t test were used.
Results The mean percentage hours of optimal sedation was
significantly longer in the R group (108.3 ± 26.3 = 5.5 days) than
in the S group (86.5 ± 6.5). This was achieved with less frequent
infusion rate adjustments (0.34 ± 0.25 changes/hour) than in the S
group (0.42 ± 0.22 changes/hour). The mean durations of mechanical
ventilation were comparable in both groups (76 ± 14 hours SD).
The extubation time were significantly longer in the S group
(22.1 ± 4.4 hours, 75 ± 5 min) than in the R group (4.1 ± 2.0 hours,
10 ± 6 min), respectively (P < 0.001). The total mean hospitalisa-
tion time in the ICU was reduced by 48 ± 8 hours in G1 compared
with G2 (P < 0.005). The R mean infusion rate was 0.12 ± 0.9
µg/kg/min, whereas the S mean infusion rate was 0.38 ± 0.14
µg/kg/min. More subjects in the S group (32 of 50) than in the R
group (6 of 50) required tramadol (P < 0.001). The mean EVA at
the end of the ICU stay was for G1: 1 ± 1 and for G2: 2 ± 3
(P < 0.005). The incidence of adverse events was low and
comparable across the two treatment groups. The global
hospitalisation cost shows a 26% reduction for patients in G1
despite a raise of 8% when R is used compared with S.
Conclusions A remifentanil-based regimen was more effective in
the provision of optimal analgesia sedation than a standard
sufentanyl-based regimen. The remifentanil-based regimen allowed
a more rapid emergence from sedation and facilitated earlier
extubation, and so diminished total ICU hospitalisation time and
cost. The prevention of NIH allows an optimal narco-sedative level
without increased doses of remifentanyl and lower needs for
analgesics at the end of ICU hospitalisation.

Sufentanil versus fentanyl in intraoperative and
postoperative periods in pediatric patients
L Popovic, M Peklic, T Kifer
Children’s Hospital Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P438 (doi: 10.1186/cc4785)
In our study we compared sufentanil vs fentanyl in children under-
going Lich–Gregoir antireflux plasty. The aim of this study was to
evaluate and compare the hemodynamic parameters during anesthesia
as well as the time of extubation of both opioid analgesics.
Patients were included in two groups of 20 patients: group I,
sufentanil and group II, fentanyl (mean age 5.42 ± 3.25 years;
mean body weight 15.87 ± 4.02 kg). All were premedicated with
midazolam 0.2 mg/kg intranasally, 10 min before induction of
anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.5 µg/kg
(group I) or fentanyl 2 µg/kg (group II) and propofol 3–4 mg/kg,
followed by vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained
using isofluorane in oxygen and nitrous oxide. In group I sufentanil
was administered in the dose of 1 µg/kg intravenously prior to
skin incision. In group II fentanyl was administered in the dose of
1 µg/kg intravenously at the same time. Hemodynamic parameters
such as systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were
recorded.
Following induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation,
hemodynamic parameters in group I did not increase. During
intubation patients in group II showed an increase of measured
hemodynamic parameters. The average time before postoperative
tracheal extubation was 62.20 ± 15.55 min in the sufentanil group
and 75.27 ± 10.20 min in the fentanyl group, which was
statistically significant. In the ICU pain and overall satisfaction were
assessed with a 10-point visual scale. There was no difference in
the requirements for pain relief.
Our study showed that sufentanil versus fentanyl in an appropriate
dose does not change hemodynamic parameters during anesthesia
induction. Postoperative requirements for pain relief were the same
in both opioid analgesics.

Sparing analgesic effect using pregabaline in postsurgical
trauma patients in the ICU
F Meurant, A Bodart
Kirchberg Hospital, Luxembourg
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P439 (doi: 10.1186/cc4786)
Introduction Pregabaline (Lyrica®), a γ-aminobutyric acid
analogue, reduces neuropathic pain more than placebo does and
is well tolerated [1]. We wanted to determine the possible sparing
effect over piritramide demands when pregabaline was given as
soon as acute pain occurred in postsurgical trauma patients.
Methods Thirty-three polytrauma patients needing orthopaedic
surgery were admitted to our ICU during a 10-month period of
time. On average, enteral feeding could be given 2 days after
surgery and the prospective double-blind randomized study began
thereafter. Two groups were defined: the control group (Gc: n =
21) receiving placebo every day via nasogastric tube, and the
second group (Gp: n = 22) receiving pregabaline using the same
route (T1: days 1–2, 75 mg/12 hours; T2: days 3–7, 150 mg/12
hours; T3: days 8–35, 300 mg/12 hours). Every patient received
intravenously perfusalgan (1 g/6 hours) and piritramide via an
infusion pump for patient-controlled analgesia (bolus 2 mg/10 min
with a maximal dose of 12 mg/hour) when the Visual Analogue
Scale was over 4. Piritramide consumption (Pc: total bolus delivery)
was noted every day in every group. This study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of the Centre Hospitalier Kirchberg and
informed consent was obtained for each patient via family
members. For statistical analysis a Shapiro–Wilk test, Wilcox test
and a Student t test were used.
Results Demographic data were comparable in both groups in
terms of age (38 ± 19 years), gender (32% female in Gc vs 35%
in Gp) and injuries (ISS: 18 ± 8). The total mean hospitalisation
time in ICU was similar in both groups (Gc: 25 ± 6 days; Gp: 22 ±
10 days). In Gp two patients died at days 11 and 16 from septic
complications, in Gc three patients died at days 8, 19 and 22 from
septic shock, lung emboly and multiple organ failure. The average
Pc values at T1 do not differ significantly between groups (Gc: 36
± 2; Gp 33 ± 2). At T2 significant differences appeared showing a
decrease in Pc by 22% in Gc (28 ± 2) and by 42% in Gp (19 ± 1)
(P < 0.005). At T3 a more significant decrease of 78% in Pc was
observed in Gp (4 ± 4) and of 46% in Gc (15 ± 6) (P < 0.002).
No neurological adverse effects were described in Gp.
Conclusion In this study, pregabaline was used for the first time as
a preventive analgesic drug and showed its importance by sparing
piritramide consumption in postsurgical trauma patients. Pain
control became more efficient by diminishing stress and thus co-
morbidity factors. This could effectively reduce the future
occurrence of chronic pain, cost and thus improve quality of life
upon discharge from the hospital.

Assessment of sedation in patients with pressure-
controlled ventilation: tidal-volume variance, sedation
scores or bispectral index?
W Huber, F Meiswinkel, A Umgelter, W Reindl, R Hollweck,
K Wagner, S Delius, R Schmid
Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Muenchen, Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P440 (doi: 10.1186/cc4787)
Background Mechanical ventilation is nonphysiological and usually
requires sedation. The assessment of sedation is not standardised.
Until now, clinical criteria and several scores are used to assess
sedation (Ramsay Score [RS], Cook and Palma Score [CPS],
Cohen and Kelly Score [CKS], Chamorro Score [CS], linear
Sedation Score [LSS] and RASS). Time-consuming apparative
methods such as EEG are not routinely used. The bispectral index
(BIS) is promising, but not routinely available. Biologically, variability
of ventilation parameters is a well-known phenomenon; however, it
is not used to assess sedation. It was therefore the aim of our
study to investigate the correlation of tidal-volume variance (TVV)
and the aforementioned sedation scores.
Materials and methods In 80 patients of an internal ICU with MOF,
pressure-controlled ventilation and continuous sedation, RS, CPS,
CKS, CS and LSS were independently documented by physician (P),
nurse (N) and investigator (I; not working in the ICU). Subsequently
200 consecutive tidal volumes were documented. TVV was calculated
and compared with the aforementioned sedation scores. Additionally
TVV was compared with the BIS. Ventilation was according to
ARDSnet recommendations, Siemens Servo 900C or Servo300,
Trigger –2 cmH2O. Statistics: SPSS software, Spearman correlation.
Results Patient characteristics (mean ± SD): age 57.4 ± 15.4
years, 28 female, 52 male, APACHE II score 28.2 ± 6.6; number of
organ failures 4.0 ± 1.12; preceding ICU period 8.5 ± 9.3 days;
continuous sedation with midazolam 31.2 ± 34.2 mg/hour, fentanyl
0.12 ± 0.08 mg/hour, propofol 45.6 ± 105.2 mg/hour; sedation
assessment according to RS 5.65 ± 0.63, CPS 5.15 ± 1.67, CKS
0.65 ± 0.69, CS 9.34 ± 2.13 und LSS 1.78 ± 1.69, RASS
–4.50 ± 1.27, FiO2 0.52 ± 0.17, PEEP 8.2 ± 2.4 cmH2O,
ventilatory frequency 20.5 ± 4.8/min, pressure control 16.8 ± 4.4
cmH2O, tidal volume 540 ± 115 ml, TVV 2525.6 ± 11,366 ml
(minimum 1.52; maximum 91,586).
Despite the limited number of patients there was a significant
correlation of TVV and the sedation scores (coefficient of
correlation of TVV compared with the sedation scores of P, N and
I, respectively: *P < 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01, NS = not significant): CKS:
0.32**; 0.408**; 0.396**; CS: 0.212NS; 0.371**; 0.394**; LSS:
0.345**; 0.407**; 0.423**; CPS: 0.413**; 0.363**; 0.388**; RS:
–0.2NS; –0.20NS; –0.261*; RASS: 0.23*; 0.188; 0.289**.
Additionally, TVV significantly correlated with BIS values (41.3 ±
18.8; Spearman coefficient 0.461**).
Conclusions Calculating TVV is a simple and cheap tool for

Introduction Unplanned extubations (UEs) occur in 4.2–14% of
critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. UE is defined as
premature removal of endotracheal tube. UEs are associated with
increased morbidity, mortality and utilisation of resources. We
collected data from patients who extubated themselves during a 6-
month period. The aim of the study was to assess risk factors for
UE using the Prevention and Recovery Information System for
Monitoring and Analysis (PRISMA) method. The method is used in
the chemical and steel industry, and nowadays in health care. The
goal of this method is to build a quantitative database of incidents
and process deviations from which conclusions may be drawn to
suggest preventive measures. Incidents are described by means of
causal trees to identify root causes.
Method In a 28-bed surgical, thoracic surgical and medical ICU
24/7 all UEs were directly reported by telephone to the main
investigator. By means of a structured interview, data on the specific
circumstances of the UE were obtained from the nurse and doctor
involved. By exploring the situational characteristics of a UE by
interviewing medical and nursing staff, we developed in collaboration
with professionals in Patient Safety Systems a causal tree consisting
of three main contributing actions: inadequate treatment agitation,
patient nonacceptance of tube, and no prevention of UE. Each UE
was analysed by two investigators independently to identify which of
the main actions contributed. Combinations of causes were
subsequently identified, leading to identification of root causes.
Results Twenty-five patients were enrolled with 640 ventilation
periods and 2962 ventilation days. This yielded an incidence of
3.9% and 0.8 UEs per 100 ventilation days. The mean age was
58.2 ± 17.0. Male–female ratio was 2.1. The mean APACHE score
was 16.6 ± 5.0. At the time of UE, the mean Ramsay sedation
score was 1.88 ± 0.7 and the weaning–nonweaning ratio 1.8.
Reintubation was needed in 48% of the cases.
In 32% of the patients, inadequate treatment agitation led to UE. In
the case of patient nonacceptance of tube (56%), 57% patients
were in delirium and 43% were fully conscious left unnecessary
intubated. In 83% this delay in extubation despite good clinical
condition was due to suboptimal management. In 16%, the
decision to extubate the patient was not executed because of the
night hour. No prevention of the actual extubation was in 64%
related to no detection that occurred because personnel was busy
elsewhere (80%) and/or not expecting the extubation (94%). No
expectation coincided with false assessment of adequacy of the
fixation technique (92%).
Conclusion Incident analysis by the PRISMA method is a feasible
method to identify contributing factors to UE. Optimalisation of
agitation treatment and extubation protocols, and increased
awareness of high-risk conditions, could prevent UEs.

Introduction The level of sedation in ICU patients is difficult to
assess, and relies on clinical assessments such as the Ramsay
score. These tests discriminate deep sedation poorly. We
evaluated a novel measure, EEG/EMG responsiveness, and
compared it with Ramsay scores. EEG/EMG responsiveness was
calculated by applying an algorithm that detects abrupt changes in
the measured EEG signal indicative of a patient’s arousal or
activation. The results were compared with those obtained using
the EEG entropy.

S185
Methods Thirty consenting general ICU patients with non-
neurologic primary ICU diagnosis were investigated for a maximum
of 72 hours. The Response Entropy (RE) and State Entropy (SE)
values as well as the EEG signals from which the EEG/EMG
responsiveness was calculated were recorded from forehead
electrodes using the Entropy™ Module (GE Healthcare). When
possible, the Ramsay score was evaluated every 30 min by a single
trained observer, amounting to a total of 370 assessments.
Results Figure 1a,b shows the distributions of the EEG/EMG
responsiveness and RE values for the six Ramsay levels. The box
diagrams indicate the median and quartile values. The obtained
prediction probability PK = 0.86 for EEG/EMG responsiveness to
distinguish deep Ramsay levels 4–6 from levels 1–3 was
significantly higher than the corresponding PK values 0.80 and
0.79 for RE and SE (P < 0.05). In the subgroup of 18 patients
judged clinically to have no acute brain disorders, the PK values for
EEG/EMG responsiveness, RE, and SE (0.91, 0.85, and 0.84)
were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those in the remaining
subgroup of 12 patients with encephalopathy (0.78, 0.73, and
0.75).
Conclusion The novel measure of EEG/EMG responsiveness
shows promise as an indicator for the level of sedation.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P443 (doi: 10.1186/cc4790)
Background Delirium is a common but underdiagnosed and
treated problem in the ICU. It has been associated with poor
hospital outcomes, including increased morbidity and mortality,
prolonged length of stay and functional decline. Recently published
clinical practice guidelines from the Society of Critical Care
Medicine recommended monitoring for the presence of delirium in
all mechanically ventilated patients.
Objectives To compare the usual clinical assessment for delirium
and the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit
(CAM-ICU), to describe its characteristics in chronically ventilated
patients and to evaluate the incidence, associated clinical
conditions, use of antipsychotic drugs and late mortality.
Patients and methods A prospective observational study where
delirium was evaluated on a daily basis and followed by a group of
physicians and a nurse, previously trained. Thirty-five consecutive
patients were admitted to the Ventilatory Care Unit (VCU) during a
period of 9 mouths. Thirteen tracheotomized, mechanically
ventilated, awake and cooperative subjects were included in the
study protocol. Three of them returned to the VCU after discharge
and were re-included, resulting in a total of 16 patients studied.
The CAM-ICU tool was applied 5 days a week at same time in the
afternoon and its data was compared with the physicians’ and
nurse’s evaluation. The results are expressed as the mean ± SD.
For statistical analysis we used the chi-square test for evaluated
difference of proportion, and considered statistical significance as
P < 0.05.
Results Five females and 11 males were studied. The mean age of
the study population was 66.46 ± 14.98 and the mean APACHE II
score 18 ± 4.6. Delirium occurred in seven patients (43.8%)
during the VCU stay and the CAM-ICU tool detected 68% of it.
The mean onset was 11.17 ± 8.91 days and the mean duration
was 1.62 ± 0.94 days. New infection was associated with delirium
in 30.7% of cases; however, using the CAM-ICU tool this
association increased to 56% (P = 0.16). Comparing the mean
titulated C reactive protein (CRP-t) level and insulin dose used in
patients diagnosed with delirium (D group) and no delirium (ND
group) was not significant (Table 1). Sensorial deficit was not
present in any patient without delirium. Mortality after 30 days was
not significant between both groups. Olanzapin and bromazepan
were the most prescripted drugs.
Table 1 (abstract P443)
D group ND group P value
CRP-t 9.6 ± 5.5 7.5 ± 3.5 0.37
Insulin 46.4 ± 29.7 40.3 ± 33.5 0.76
Conclusion The incidence of delirium in this study was less than
expected. CAM-ICU demonstrated inferior sensibility than that
described in the literature. We could not demonstrate any
difference between groups. The main limitation of this study was
the low number of patients enrolled.

The shot-time protective effect of hypoxic preconditioning
on ischemia/reperfusion brain

Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P444 (doi: 10.1186/cc4791)
Objective To observe that hypoxic preconditioning (HP) plays a
protective role on ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) brain within a short
period. This experiment proved that HP can protect I/R brain by
abating death and apoptosis of cells in the hippocampus; further-
more, HP also improved cognition at the fifth day after I/R.
Method Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g) were used in
this experiment. Rats were divided into four groups randomly –
sham group, control group (I/R), A group and B group – 16 rats in
each group.
Ischemia was induced by withdrawal of 6–10 ml blood from the
jugular catheter so as to reduce the mean arterial blood pressure
to 25–30 mmHg. The carotids were then occluded with aneutysm
clips, and was confirmed by the presence of an isoelectric
electroencephalogram. To terminate ischemia, shed blood was
reinfused, and the aneutysm clips were removed.
HP refers to rats exposed to 8% O2 for 3 hours before I/R. The
sham group was without HP nor I/R, the control group received I/R
without HP. The A group and B group endured I/R with HP before
1 day and 2 days, respectively.
The rats underwent a behavioral test (water maze, Passive
Avoidance Task) on the fifth day after I/R followed by
histopathology and TUNEL analysis. Histopathology and TUNEL

analysis were performed for death and apoptosis of hippocampus
cells, respectively.
All values are expressed as means ± SEM in experiments.
Statistical analysis was assessed by one-way ANOVA. P < 0.05
was considered significant to reject the null hypothesis.
Results Histopathology showed that I/R resulted in tissue loss and
necrosis in the CA1 and CA3 regions, death cells in the control
group increased compared with the sham group, P < 0.01.The
numbers of necrosis cells in CA1 and CA3 of the A group and B
group all were significantly lower than the control group, P < 0.01.
Moreover there were less death cells in the B group than in the A
group P < 0.05, but there was no difference between the CA1 and
CA3 regions. In the TUNEL staining assay, the apoptotic cells
were stained brown. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was
higher in the sham group than in the control group, P < 0.01. The
number of apoptotic cells in the control group is more than in the A
and B groups (P < 0.01), the degree of apoptosis was less in the
B group compared with the A group, P < 0.05. There was no
difference between CA1 and CA3 regions in all groups. The water
maze and Passive Avoidance Task showed that the learning and
memory ability of rats in the control group was injured after I/R,
contrasting with the sham group P < 0.05. HP can improve
cognition; learning and remembering ability in the A group and B
group was significantly better than the control group, P < 0.05,
especially in the B group. The movement test also offered similar
result as these
That I/R can injure the brain has been confirmed by many authors;
furthermore, I/R can also impair learning and memory ability. HP
was discovered to be a protective method against I/R injury
recently. In our experiment, HP can relieve necrosis and apoptosis
of the hippocampus CA1 and CA3 regions. Moreover HP
improved cognition and movement at day 5 after I/R obviously.
From these results it was discovered that HP applied 2 days
before I/R can produce more effective function than at 1 day
before I/R. In a word, HP can improve cognition a short time after
the brain receives I/R, and it is possible that HP played this role by
deceasing necrosis and apoptosis cells in CA1 and CA3 of the
hippocampus.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P445 (doi: 10.1186/cc4792)
Objective In the time course of stroke or traumatic brain injury,
astrocytes become acidotic and swollen. The question remains
whether acidosis influences intracellular sodium concentrations
and the astrocyte volume.
Methods In cultured human astrocytoma cells, the effect of sodium
propionate (NP) or ischemic medium (IM) on the cellular volume
and intracellular hydrogen or sodium was documented by
videomicroscopy and monitoring of the fluorescence of BCECF
and SBFI, respectively. To quantify the participation of a Na+/H+
exchanger, a specific inhibitor (ethyl isopropyl amiloride [EIPA])
was added.
Results Addition of NP resulted in an immediate intracellular
acidosis, which only partially recovered after washout, and an
immediate rise in intracellular sodium. NP introduced an increase
of cell diameter to 120 ± 2%, followed by a reactive volume
decrease within 15 min. EIPA was able to partially inhibit
intracellular acidification (5 µM EIPA), and to abrogate cell swelling
(10 µM EIPA). Comparable results were found with IM.
Conclusion Intracellular astrocyte pH increase found during life-
threatening brain conditions influence astrocyte swelling. Na+/H+
exchangers participate in these pathways.

Neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of fentanyl
preconditioning against brain ischemia
X Wang
Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P446 (doi: 10.1186/cc4793)
Introduction Fentanyl is an artificial agonist of opioids, and belongs
to the µ-opioid receptor agonists. During cardiopulmonary bypass
(CPB), a large dose of fentanyl was administered (usually achieved
50–100 µg/kg, loading dose exceeded 50 µg/kg, maintenance
dose was 20–30 µg/min). Since the advent of CPB, cerebral
complications from overt stroke to subtle cognitive dysfunction after
CPB for cardiac surgery have been well documented; the
postoperative incidence of dysfunction of cognition exceeded
20–70%. The etiology of these injuries are probably associated
with cerebral microemboli, global or regional ischemia, inflammation,
cerebral temperature modulation and metabolic abnormality. There
are disputes about the effects of large doses of µ-opioid receptor
agonist; furthermore, evidence about the effect of large doses of
fentanyl on brain injury during CPB have not been reported. Some
researchers documented that µ-opioid receptor agonists (including
morphine or fentanyl) had neuroprotective effects, and
predominantly by the activation of δ1 opioid agonist. While reports
that µ-opioid receptor agonists have no neuroprotective effect, even
causing brain injury can also been seen.
Objective There have been some disputes about the clinical
application of µ-opioid receptor agonists, and it is paramount to
explore the effects and mechanisms of fentanyl on brain ischemia.
Methods In this study, we investigated the effects of fentanyl on
cerebral ischemia during the perioperative period, and the
mechanisms of neuroprotective effects modulated by subtype
opioid receptors or the molecular signaling pathway were explored.
This study consisted of three models: moderate hypothermia
cardiopulmomary bypass in the rat, brain slices with oxygen-
glucose deprivation (OGD), and PC12 cell lines with OGD.
Immunohistochemistry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP-bition nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, electron
microscopy, RT-PCR, western blot, TTC staining, LDH release,
Flow CytoMeter and Hoechst33258 staining were used.
Results This protective effect of fentanyl preconditioning is U-
shaped as demonstrated in the dose–response curves. It was
found that micromolar concentrations of fentanyl are antiapoptotic,
whereas with increasing concentrations fentanyl lacks apparent
protective effects. Clinical concentrations of fentanyl
preconditioning have neuroprotective effects against cerebral
ischemia injury, and antiapoptosis is one of the underlying
mechanisms. In detail, we demonstrated that moderate
hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass in the rat can induce
hippocampal c-fos, bcl-2 and bax mRNA expressions and protein
expressions, increase neuronal apoptosis, and worsen histology
injury detected by electron microscope. F50 (fentanyl: LD =
50 µg/kg, MD = 2 µg/kg/min) or F800 (fentanyl: LD = 800 µg/kg,
MD = 32 µg/kg/min) can attenuate brain ischemia injury induced
by CPB, especially in the dose of 50 µg/kg. Furthermore, the same
results were demonstrated in brain slices or PC12 cells with OGD
injury. Either 50 ng/ml or 500 ng/ml fentanyl (the peak
concentration or plateau concentration, respectively, of fentanyl
Critical Care March 2006 Vol 10 Suppl 1 26th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine
S187
with loading dose 50 µg/kg) decreases neuronal apoptosis and
inhibits the release of LDH so it can attenuate brain slice injury,
Moreover, fentanyl preconditioning can strengthen the protein
expression of Bcl-2 while Bax protein expression was inhibited.
Compared with fentanyl 500 ng/ml, fentanyl 50 ng/ml played a
stronger role in brain slices or PC12 cells with OGD injury.
In addition, we determined that δ-opioid receptors are unique and
have a specific role in neuroprotection against OGD injury by
activating the MAPK pathway, specifically through δ1-opioid
receptors. In detail, fentanyl preconditioning had a protective effect
on brain slices with OGD injury. The effect was mainly mediated by
the δ1 subtype opioid receptor because the role of fentanyl
preconditioning was blocked or attenuated by naloxone (a
nonselective opioid receptor antagonist), naltrindole (nonselective
δ-opioid receptor antagonist) and BNTX δ1-opioid receptor
antagonist), respectively. However, naltriben (δ2-opioid receptor
antagonist), β-funaltrexamine (µ-receptor antagonist) or norbinaltor-
phimine (κ-opioid receptor antagonist) cannot inhibit the protective
effect of fentanyl preconditioning. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was up-
regulated by fentanyl preconditioning. BNTX or U0126 can block
the ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by fentanyl preconditioning,
while the neuroprotective effect of fentanyl preconditioning was
also abolished.
Conclusions Collectively, we found that fentanyl preconditioning
played a role in neuronal protection against hypoxic ischemia,
attenuated ischemia injury and inhibited apoptosis of neurons. δ-
opioid receptors were unique and had a specific role in
neuroprotection against OGD injury by activating the MAPK
pathway, mainly through δ1-opioid receptors. µ-opioid receptor
agonist can be safely applied to brain ischemia during CPB.

Antiapoptotic action of delta opioid peptide
[D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin against oxygen-glucose
deprivation in brain slices
X Wang
Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P447 (doi: 10.1186/cc4794)
Background The delta opioid peptide [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin
(DADLE) has been shown to play a role in neuronal protection
against hypoxic ischemia. However, the cellular mechanisms of
these actions of DADLE on neurons are not totally clear. Being an
in-vitro model of brain ischemia, oxygen-glucose deprivation
(OGD) injury in rat brain slices has the advantages of both in-vivo
and in-vitro models, and therefore can imitate damages induced by
brain I/R injury in intact animals. In the present study, we examined
the protective mechanism(s) of DADLE against apoptosis using a
rat brain slice model. In addition, we determined whether δ-opioid
receptors are unique and have a specific role in neuroprotection
against OGD injury by activating the MAPK pathway, specifically
through δ2-opioid receptors.
Methods The brain slices were injured by OGD, and then
incubated with different concentrations of DADLE. Selective δ2-
opioid antagonist or selective inhibitor of ERK kinase was co-
incubated with or without DADLE. The effects of DADLE against
apoptosis in neurons were measured by the following biochemical
and morphological assays: the LDH release, RT-PCR, western
blot, and TUNEL staining.
Results This protective effect of DADLE is U-shaped as
demonstrated in the dose–response curves. It was found that
micromolar concentrations of DADLE are antiapoptotic, whereas
micromolar concentrations of DADLE lack apparent protective
effects. The protective effect of DADLE can be attenuated by a
selective δ2-opioid antagonist. The treatment of cells with
PD98059, a selective inhibitor of ERK kinase (MEK), blocked both
the protective effect of DADLE and the ERK phosphorylation
induced by DADLE.
Conclusions Our results suggest, therefore, that endogenous
opioid peptides may, at low concentrations, promote cell survival
via the MEK–ERK pathway, perhaps through δ2-opioid receptors.

Role of optic nerve ultrasonography in the diagnosis of
elevated intracranial pressure

Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P448 (doi: 10.1186/cc4795)
Objective In the evaluation of the emergency patients with
elevated intracranial pressure (EICP) due to traumatic or
nontraumatic causes, optic nerve ultrasonography (ONUS) has
been researched in terms of convenience and utility.
Method Patients who visited the University of Selcuk, Meram
Medical Faculty, Department of Emergency Medicine with traumatic
or nontraumatic EICP were put through the study. Among these
patients, 28 patients with EICP in their cranial computed tomography
(CCT) and a control group of 26 patients with no disease had the
vertical and horizontal diameters of the optic nerves of both of their
eyes measured by ultrasonography. The measurements were done
by wetting the closed eyelids and using the 7.5-MHz linear probe
placed in a bag that was full of gel. In the statistical research carried
out between these two groups (t test), it was found that P < 0.001.
Also, the concordance among all the measurements made in the
study was examined within the frame of the ‘Concordance
Correlation Coefficient’ formula. Five of the six values found were
over 0.90, and one of them just below 0.90; these results were a
sign of support for concordance among the measurements.
Results In the study, the horizontal and vertical diameter
measurements of both ONs of the 54 patients were done and then
averaged. The mean ON diameter for the 28 patients in the study
group was found as 6.4 ± 0.7 mm, and the mean ON diameter for
the control group was 4.6 ± 0.3 mm. The ON diameter of all the
control group was evaluated as normal, whereas the ON diameter
of all the patients with brain edema in their CCT was raised.
Conclusion In detecting and following up the EICP cases such as
cerebrovascular accident and trauma, ONUS is a method that is
quite practical, risk free, of low cost, convenient and also reliable if
done by experts. For the unconscious patients with no diagnosis,
ONUS would be very helpful in eliminating an EICP cause and in
leading these patients to CCT. In the case of EICP, the first finding
is the dilation in the ON diameter, and with this feature it may be
more useful, perhaps not in diagnosing, but in detecting EICP, than
CCT. In the cases where CCT is not available, the use of ONUS
would help lead the diagnosis and treatment of the patients.

Objective A retrospective observational study to establish the
traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage (tSAH) ratio in all traumatic
brain injury (TBI), the overall prognosis, and to determine whether
the quantity and distribution of blood in subarachnoid space
influences prognosis.
Available online http://ccforum.com/supplements/10/S1
S188
Materials and methods Over a period of 1.5 years, 98 patients
were admitted diagnosed with TBI. Fifty-two (53.06%) had tSAH.
The Greene classification was used to determine the degree of
bleeding. We differentiated between patients with tSAH diffused in
the convexity, in basal cisterns and those with bleeding in both
(mixed pattern). We recorded the sex, age, Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at the time of
discharge from acute hospitalisation. For the statistical analysis
three groups of TBI were considered, according to the GCS: slight
(GCS 13–15), moderate (GCS 3–7) and severe (GCS 3–7).
Analysis was carried out to determine whether there were any
positive or negative factors related to tSAH (paying particular
attention to blood distribution). The relationship between age,
Greene classification, GCS and GOS were evaluated by multiple
logistic regression and chi-square test.
Results The prognosis of the patients with tSAH was worse (Table 1).
Chi-square = 5.21 P = 0.022. The follow-up study was carried out
until discharge from acute hospitalisation: 21 patients (40.38%)
had a good prognosis and 30 (57.69%) had an unfavourable
prognosis. The overall mortality was 21 (46.15%). There is no
statistically significant relationship between tSAH distribution and
the GCS on admission, but there is relationship between tSAH
distribution and the GOS. A logistic regression model to evaluate
the contribution of the GCS, degree of Greene classification and
age with the GOS shows these results (Table 2).
Table 1 (abstract P449)
tSAH No tSAH
GOS 4–5 22 31
GOS 1–3 30 15
Table 2 (abstract P449)
Odds ratio 95% CI
Age 1.36 0.65–2.86
Greene 1.14 0.80–1.63
GCS 1.09 0.82–1.45
Conclusion TSAH is a negative prognosis factor: the degree of
tSAH is significantly related to the clinical condition on admission
and the prognosis of the patient. The presence of tSAH in the
cisterns and convexity (mixed pattern) indicates a worse prognosis.
It is most frequently located in the convexity and basal cisterns.

Survey of cerebral perfusion pressure measurement:
location of the arterial transducer in the patient managed
at 30° elevation
M Ingram, R Lightfoot, A Eynon
Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P450 (doi: 10.1186/cc4797)
Introduction In 2003 the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF)
published an update notice to its guidelines on the management of
severe head injury in adults, focusing on cerebral perfusion
pressure (CPP), this being the physiologic variable that drives
cerebral blood flow. Guidance suggests that CPP should be
maintained at a minimum of 60 mmHg.
Clinical practice in the United Kingdom may involve nursing the
severely head-injured patient at an angle of 30°, although there is
no consensus as to whether patients should be nursed flat or with
their head up to 30°.
The location of the arterial transducer will influence the measured
MAP and hence the CPP (CPP = MAP – ICP). This survey was
conducted to establish current practice in measuring MAP, and to
ascertain when nursing a patient at 30° whether the arterial
transducer was referenced to the level of the external auditory
meatus or the left atrium.
Methods A telephone survey was conducted of the 28 UK
neuroscience ICUs. The nurse in charge was identified and asked,
‘When measuring CPP on neurosurgical patients nursed at 30°, is
the arterial transducer placed at the level of the head or the heart?’
Results The results suggest differing practice within the United
Kingdom. Twenty units positioned the transducer at the level of the
left atrium while six units used the level of the external auditory
meatus. One unit sited the transducer at the wrist (no extension
line used), and in one unit the practice varied depending upon
which consultant was on duty. Variation in practice was evident
between dedicated neurosurgical as well as general ICUs.
Discussion At 30° above the horizontal, the hydrostatic effect may
reduce MAP in the head by up to 10 mmHg. The associated fall in
ICP has been shown to be around 3 mmHg. The measured CPP
would therefore be 7 mmHg lower if the transducer is at the level
of the head as compared with the heart. This discrepancy is of
fundamental importance as McGraw’s model directly relates
outcome to the measured CPP. The BTF recommends a minimum
target CPP of 60 mmHg but makes no allowance for posture. In
the clinical setting when nursing a patient at 30° with the arterial
transducer at the level of the heart, a target CPP of 60 mmHg may
result in CPP within the great vessels of the head below the BTF
recommendation.
Without a common approach it is difficult to discuss the ideal
target CPP. Location of the arterial transducer needs to be clarified
as it may result in an outcome difference dependent upon practice,
and multicentre trials require a standardised approach. Until this is
addressed authors should state the level at which the arterial
transducer is referenced in the measurement of CPP.

Introduction We retrospectively investigated the impact of
polytrauma (ISS > 16) on a population of severe brain injured (SBI)
patients (GCS < 8).
Patients and methods Thirty consecutive patients with SBI and
polytrauma (Group I) were matched with 30 patients with SBI
(Group II) treated during the same period. The matching criteria
were age +4 years, gender, APACHE II +1, and same GCS. The
ICU mortality, length of ICU stay (LOS), duration of intubation,
mechanical ventilation (MV), sedation and analgesia were
assessed. Patient characteristics (age, gender), severity of illness
(APACHE II, GCS), serum Na+ and glucose, systolic blood
pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR) and core temperature were
recorded on admission to the ICU. Statistical analysis was
performed with the Mann–Whitney U test and statistical
significance was considered as P < 0.05.
Results See Tables 1 and 2. Significant differences were found
between the two groups in LOS, duration of intubation, time with
analgesia treatment, admission SBP and temperature. The time on
mechanical ventilation, sedation interval and ICU mortality did not
differ between the two groups, as indicated in Table 2.

Conclusions Patients with SBI and polytrauma had a lower
admission SBP and temperature, a longer ICU stay, more

The actuality of the problem is conditioned by the high death rate
and invalidism of working-age persons, which is a severe burden
for society.
Our aim was the analysis of the cerebral hemodynamics in young
patients during an acute period of ischemic stroke (IS).
We examined 17 patients (nine men and eight women) with IS, their
mean age was 44.2 ± 4.9 years. None of these patients was observed
apropos cerebral vascular disease before IS. Brain CT scans of all
patients demonstrated the symptoms of ischemic stroke as the
decreased density foci in the basin of the middle cerebral artery.
To study cerebral hemodynamics, all patients underwent duplex
scanning of the neck and brain vessels using the scanner
ACUSON 128XP/10c (USA) according to the standard method.
Only one patient (6.4%) had no changes during the US
examination of the vessels. Six patients (35.3%) demonstrated
small thickening of more than 1.1 mm of the ‘intima-media’ complex
in the carotid artery in the absence of plaque formation, 30–40%
asymmetry of the blood flow velocity in the medial cerebral arteries,
and peripheral resistance indexes increased in the medial cerebral
arteries or in the vertebrobasilar basin. In 11.5% of cases the
symptoms of atherosclerotic change of the carotid arteries were
more evident, but they were hemodynamically insignificant. There
were small plaques in the bifurcation zone of the internal carotid
arteries and S-shape tortuosity of the orifices of the internal carotid
arteries. Almost one-half of the patients had evident signs of
atherosclerosis. Occlusion and significant stenosis were observed
in two patients with moderate changes at the extracranial level in
one of the medial cerebral arteries. The atherosclerotic changes
were evident in other patients (six persons, 35.3%); moreover, one-
half of the patients had significant stenosis revealed in the carotid
and in the vertebral arteries. Two patients had occlusion in one of
the internal carotid arteries and one patient had significant stenosis
only in the vertebrobasilar basin.
In spite of the young age of the patients, they all therefore had
quite evident changes of the cerebral hemodynamics in the back-
ground of the different degrees of atherosclerotic signs. The ultra-
sonic markers of early-stage atherosclerosis in the increased arterial
tonus were revealed in one-third of patients. More than one-half of the
patients after IS had the evident atherosclerotic changes of the
cerebral vessels. In spite of the presence of the arterial occlusion in
some patients, the clinical manifestation was absent before the stroke.

Objective To investigate the association between multiple monitoring
parameters and the outcome in patients with severe brain trauma.
Patients and methods Thirty-one patients with a mean age of
43 ± 18 years were included in this prospective study. All of them
had suffered serious traumatic brain damage (GCS ≤ 8 or GCS
< 10 accompanied by a mass lesion in the initial CT scan). Their
outcome was evaluated with the GOS in 6 months and they were
divided according to that into two subgroups (favorable vs un-
favorable outcome). During their ICU hospitalization, these patients
were under brain function monitoring, consisting of three intra-
cranial catheters: two for continuous monitoring of ICP and ptiO2,
and a third microdialysis catheter for the measurement of glucose,
lactate, pyruvate and glycerol in the interstitial fluid of the brain. The
microdialysis samples were collected every 2 hours and were auto-
matically analyzed. The monitoring period lasted for up to 10 days.
Results From the patients included, 15 (48.39%) had bad
outcome (GOS = 1, 2, 3) and the remaining 16 (51.61%) good
outcome (GOS = 4, 5). The group of patients with the good
outcome had lower lactate/pyruvate ratio and glycerol values,
compared with the group with the bad outcome (P < 0.001 and
P = 0.044, respectively). This difference also existed when the
maximum values of these parameters were evaluated (P = 0.03
and P = 0.011, respectively). Furthermore, mean L/P values >25
correlated with unfavorable outcome (P = 0.002). No relationship
between glucose and 6-month outcome was found. From all other
measurements, only mean CPP values correlated with outcome
(P = 0.036). Mean ICP values were only marginally significant
between the two subgroups. We could also demonstrate some
correlations between the studying parameters: mean glucose
values with mean pyruvate and mean L/P values (P = 0.001 and
P = 0.048), maximum glycerol values with minimum lactate and
maximum L/P values (P = 0.001 and P = 0.019) and maximum ICP
values with minimum ptiO2 values (0.021). Additionally, the
presence of L/P ratio >40 was associated with glucose levels less
than 0.5 (P = 0.001), and ptiO2 values <5 mmHg presented a
borderline correlation with glucose values <0.25 mg/dl (P = 0.058).
Conclusion Microdialysis, ptiO2 and ICP/CPP monitoring, when
used together, may be a useful tool in the ICU setting, allowing
continuous evaluation of brain damage and thus prognosis in
patients with traumatic brain damage.

Introduction The high incidence of intracraneal lesions of patients
with brain trauma (BT) is well known. The aim of this study is to
assess the incidence of an extracraneal injury: retinal haemorrhage
(RH) in patients after BT.
Methods A prospective study was performed during 6 months in a
15-bed medical–surgical ICU. RH was diagnosed by an ophthal-
mologist in the first 4 days after admission to the ICU. Age, personal
history, ISS, RTS, SAPS, SOFA score, APACHE score, lactate
levels and GCS were recorded on arrival at the ICU. Cerebral
edema, brain CT findings, days under mechanical ventilation and
need for neurosurgery at any time were also recorded. The
statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 11.0 program.
Results Nineteen patients were included in the study (18 males),
age 56 ± 22.56 years. Five RH were described in this group, all
males. The mechanism of traumatism was fall in 80% and traffic
accident in 20% in the RH group; in contrast, fall in 35.7% and
traffic accident in 42.9% in the nonretinal haemorrhage group
(NRH). There were no differences between groups in age, ISS,
RTS, APACHE score, SAPS, SOFA score, lactate levels and days
under mechanical ventilation. Eighty per cent of the patients with
RH were alcoholic, and 21.4% of the NRH. The GCS at admission
in the ICU was 3 in 60% of the patients with RH and 35.7% in the
NRH group. Sixty per cent of the patients with RH required
neurosurgery; in contrast, 7.1% in the NHR group. Eighty per cent
of the patients with RH developed cerebral edema during their stay
in the ICU, while this was 50% in the NRH group. Sixty per cent of
the patients with RH had frontal contusion in the CT and 14.3% in
the NRH group. Twenty per cent of the patients with RH had
epidural haematoma; in contrast, 7.1% in the NRH. Sixty per cent of
the patients with RH had epidural haematoma; in contrast, 14.2% in
the NRH. All patients with RH were discharged. Two of the patients
with RH had unilateral blindness at discharge from ICU.
Conclusions Although it is not possible to draw inferences with so
small a number of patients, future prospective studies are
warranted to corroborate our findings. RH is a quite common
finding in our study (26%). All these patients are male with an
antecedent of alcoholism. There was more severe head injury in
this group. GCS at arrival is lower. This group have more incidence
of frontal contusion, epidural or subdural haematoma, cerebral
edema and required more neurosurgical interventions.

Objective Epidural haematoma (EH) is a very serious clinical event
that is seen in almost 2% of the emergency head trauma patients,
and it needs immediate diagnosis and treatment. The relation of EH
prognosis with older age, additional intracranial pathologies,
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the duration between the trauma
and the surgical attempt has been illustrated in various studies.
And the studies regarding the effect of the epidural hematoma
volume (EHV) on prognosis are not sufficient.
In this study, different from the previous ones, the ratio of EHV over
the total brain volume (TBV) has been estimated with a new
method and the relation of this ratio with the prognosis has been
investigated.
Method In this study, 59 EH patients (46 male, 13 female, average
age: 21 years) who attended the emergency clinic have been
included. Patients with additional intracranial pathologies have been
excluded. The age, GCS and the additional system pathology of the
patients and the results of their computed cranial tomography
(CCT) were recorded. The EHV and TBV ratio was estimated with a
stereological method, and the midline shift amounts have also been
determined. From the aspect of clinical results, patients have been
classified into three groups as complete recovery (43 patients),
disability (eight patients) and exitus (eight patients). The ratio of the
EHV and TBV of the groups has been compared within the aspects
of GCS, age, shift amount and clinical results.
Results When the ratio of EHV with TBV was compared with
clinical results, there was found a statistical sense in the relationship
between the groups (P = 0.007). Similarly, there has been found a
sense from the statistical aspect between these rates and the shift
amount and GCS (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). However,
no difference could be found between the groups in terms of the
relationship of EHV ratio over TBV with the age factor (P = 0.2).
Conclusion The ratio of EHV mathematically calculated with a new
method could be an important sign in determining EH prognosis.
This method needs to be supported by more clinical and
experimental studies in a wider and deeper range.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P456 (doi: 10.1186/cc4803)
Introduction QTc dispersion is a new important prognostic factor
for many disease. We have analyzed the admission EKGs of 53
patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) for their
QTc dispersion. This study is performed to investigate the
prognostic characteristics of QTc dispersion in patients with ICH.
Methods On presentation, we measured the QTc dispersion of the
ECG and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of patients. The QTc
dispersion is the difference in the QT duration of the longest minus
the shortest rate-corrected QT interval. Computer tomography of
the brain was performed in order to determine the site of the ICH,
the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and the amount
of ICH. We attempted to determine the relationship between initial
factors, including QTc dispersion and findings of computer
tomography, as well as the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at
discharge as the final prognosis.
Results Patients exhibited a poor prognosis if they had a lower
GCS score on admission, larger volume of hemorrhage and
accompanying IVH at computer tomography scan of brain, and
increased QTc dispersion on univariate analyses. Although the
mean QTc dispersion in the group that showed a favorable
outcome was 70.6 ± 29.6 ms, and 63.8 ± 24.2 ms in the group of
GOS 1 and 76.8 ± 26.4 ms in the group of GOS 2, the mean QTc
dispersion in the group that had an unfavorable outcome was

117.6 ± 36.1 ms; 108.8 ± 29.6 ms in the group of GOS 3,
120.7 ± 1.3 ms in the group of GOS 4 and 141.8 ± 53.4 ms in the
group of GOS 5. The difference in the QTc dispersion according
to patient outcome was statistically significant.
Conclusion The QTc dispersion in the initial EKG might be a
significant factor that could be useful for prediction of outcome in
spontaneous ICH patients along with the GOS at discharge. Our
results therefore suggest that the QTc dispersion should be
included for prognosis and treatment of patients with ICH.

Introduction Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes can be observed
in patients with acute stroke without primary heart disease. The aim
of the study was to determine whether ischaemic ECG changes and
arrythmia are related to prognosis in this population of patients.
Patients and methods This prospective observational cohort study
consisted of 309 patients (168 male and 141 female, age 68.7 ±
31.5 years) with first stroke presenting to prehospital emergency
physicians in the field during 6 years (March 1999–February 2005).
Among all patients, 258 had ischaemic stroke (IS) and 51 had
haemorrhagic stroke (HS). Patients with transient ischaemic attack
were excluded from the study. Six-month mortality was analysed by
means of ischaemia-like ECG changes (ST segment, inverted T
wave, abnormal U wave), and arrythmia.
Results The members of the IS group were significantly older than
those in HS group (73 ± 30 vs 52 ± 23 years; P < 0.05). The
frequency of the ECG changes observed in patients with IS was
69% (178/258) while in patients with HS it was 31% (16/51; P <
0.05). In the IS group 81 patients (31%) had ischaemia-like changes
and 96 (37%) had arrythmia. The HS group had significantly less
ECG changes (15% had ischaemia-like changes and 11% had
arrythmia; P < 0.05). The HS group had significantly more patients
with bradycardia than the IS group (24% vs 4%; P < 0.05). The 6-
month mortality rate in patients with ECG changes was 29% (56/
194) whereas it was 16% (18/115) in those with normal ECG. In multi-
variate analyses the 6-month mortality in patients with IS was predic-
ted by atrial fibrillation (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5–3.7) and ischaemia-like
ECG changes (OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.9–3.8). In patients with HS, sinus
bradycardia predicted poor outcome (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.4–9.8).
Conclusion ECG abnormalities are frequent in acute stroke and
may predict 6-month mortality. The observations of this study
suggest differences between the IS and HS group. The ECG
evaluation of patients with acute stroke must be started at the field.
Whether the ECG changes are the result of some generalized
atherosclerosis that promotes acute stroke, or the magnitude and
perhaps location of brain infarction promotes ECG changes in the
reverse direction, remains the question.

Decompressive (hemi)craniectomy for refractory
intracranial hypertension after traumatic brain injury

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P458 (doi: 10.1186/cc4805)
Introduction Sedation, administration of mannitol or hypertonic
saline, mild hyperventilation, moderate hypothermia and high-dose
barbiturate therapy are all strategies in the treatment of intracranial
hypertension in traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intracranial pressure
(ICP) >20 mmHg not responding to conservative strategies caries
a bad prognosis, mortality exceeding 80%. A final option in
refractory intracranial hypertension might be decompressive
(hemi)craniectomy.
Methods A retrospective analysis of the outcome of 11 patients with
TBI undergoing decompressive (hemi)craniectomy for increased ICP
not responding to conservative treatment between July 2001 and
April 2005. Outcome was measured on the Glasgow Outcome
Scale (GOS). Other parameters considered were: pupil reaction,
initial Glasgow Coma Scale after resuscitation (IGCS) and
preoperative ICP.
Results Eleven patients (five male, six female; mean age 20.6
years, range 2–42 years) underwent decompressive craniotomy
when ICP could not be managed sufficiently by nonsurgical
treatment. All patients suffered from blunt, nonpenetrating head
injury, all but one had isolated TBI, and one was a multitrauma
patient. Unilateral or bilateral absent pupil reaction at admission
was seen in five patients. Two of these five patients had recurrent
episodes with absent pupil reactions and died.
The mean IGCS was 8. In the patients that died the IGCS was 5
(range 4–6, median Motor score 2). The IGCS in survivors was 9
(range 3–15, median Motor score 4).
The mean injury–craniotomy interval was 72.4 hours (range 0–10
days). In six patients surgery was performed within 48 hours after
injury. The mean ICP before surgery was 30.6 mmHg. Most times
the ICP measurement device was removed at surgery. In three
patients the ICP was measured after decompression and showed
immediate decrease in ICP (mean 10.7 mmHg).
Favourable outcome (GOS 4 + 5) was achieved in eight patients
(72.7%). Three patients (28.3%) died (GOS 1). None of the
patients had severe disability (GOS 2 + 3).
Conclusion This retrospective survey supports the use of
decompressive craniotomy in the management of TBI patients with
intractable high ICP. The number of patients studied is to small to
discriminate predictors of good outcome. Recurrent or persistent
absence of pupil reflexes indicates a poor neurological outcome.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P459 (doi: 10.1186/cc4806)
Introduction The mortality from large space-occupying infarctions
involving the middle cerebral artery (MCA) has been reported as
55–80% despite maximal medical treatment, including barbiturate
coma, mannitol and hyperventilation. Patients are typically alert on
admission to hospital but deteriorate within 1–3 days from severe
brain swelling leading to raised intracranial pressure (ICP), brain
herniation and death. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) has been
reported to improve survival and functional outcomes following
large MCA infarctions.
Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of all DCs for
large MCA infarctions performed at our institution from March
2000 to February 2005. The neurological status was evaluated
using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and functional outcome
was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) and
Modified Rankin Scale (MRS).
Results All values are expressed as the median (range) or mean ±
SD. There were 16 patients studied, nine males and seven

females, aged 56.9 ± 8.2 years. Three patients had left-sided MCA
infarctions while the rest were right-sided. Three patients had
additional infarctions involving the anterior or posterior cerebral
artery territories. The GCS was 13 (10–15) at hospital admission
and 7 (4–13) at the time of surgery. The time between stroke onset
and decompressive surgery was 47.5 ± 29.9 hours, with six
patients showing signs of uncal herniation at the time of surgery.
One patient had surgery 120 hrs after symptom onset due to late
hemorrhagic conversion in the infarct. Fourteen patients received
ICP monitoring in the postoperative period. All patients received
mannitol while nine patients needed one or more of the following
for control of raised ICP: barbiturate coma, hyperventilation and
hypothermia. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 9
(3–11) days, with tracheostomy performed in eight patients. The
ICU and hospital mortality rate was 12.5% (2/16) and 31.3%
(5/16), respectively. The median GCS of survivors at ICU
discharge was 10 (4–11), and 12 (11–15) at hospital discharge.
The ICU and hospital lengths of stay were 10 (4–14) and 28
(7–60) days, respectively. At a mean follow-up period of 13
months, 82% (9/11) of survivors were cognitive with a GOS of 3
(2–3) and MRS of 4 (3–5).
Conclusion DCs performed for large MCA infarctions with clinical
deterioration resulted in lower mortality compared with rates
reported elsewhere for maximal medical treatment. Most survivors
regained cognition but required help with walking and activities of
daily living.

Magnetic resonance imaging defines structural brain injury
acquired during critical illness
R Stevens, T Abdelhak, J Chalela
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P460 (doi: 10.1186/cc4807)
Introduction Patients with non-neurological critical illness
commonly develop cerebral dysfunction, which may take the form
of delirium, coma, and long-term cognitive impairment. Delirium in
the ICU is associated with increased mortality and prolonged
mechanical ventilation and hospital stay, and is commonly
attributed to metabolic derangements. Tests such as brain
computed tomography (CT) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis are
frequently nondiagnostic. We hypothesized that brain magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of
delirium and coma acquired in the ICU.
Methods Patients who underwent brain MRI for the evaluation of
delirium or coma while in the adult medical or surgical ICUs were
identified through an institutional database. Subjects with brain
disorders diagnosed before their admission to the ICU and those
admitted to the neurological ICU were excluded. Patients were
classified into two groups according to whether or not MRI
identified an acute pathological process.
Results Over a 2-year period, 158 critically ill patients underwent
brain MRI, among whom 96 were being evaluated for unexplained
delirium or coma. In this group, MRI revealed an acutely evolving
structural abnormality in 45 patients (47%), including cerebral
infarction in 33, intracerebral hemorrhage in seven, posterior
reversible leukoencephalopathy in three, and meningitis in two.
Demographic characteristics, admission diagnoses, SAPS II,
cardiovascular risk factors, and prevalence of sepsis, acute lung
injury, acute renal failure, and acute hepatic failure were not
significantly different between patients with and without acute
changes on MRI. The ICU length of stay and mortality were also
the same in both groups. MRI results led to a modification in
presumptive diagnosis in 46 patients (48%), and altered the
management plan in 17 (18%). No adverse events were noted in
relation to MRI and patient transfer to the radiology suite. When
compared with MRI, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive
value and negative predictive value of CT for detecting acute
cerebral changes were 44%, 57%, 42% and 48%, respectively.
Conclusions In ICU patients with delirium or coma, brain MRI
reveals an underlying acute structural abnormality in nearly one-half
of cases, while the diagnostic impact of CT appears more limited.
Occult brain injury may contribute significantly to the pathogenesis
of cerebral dysfunction acquired during critical illness.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P461 (doi: 10.1186/cc4808)
Background Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is an axional
peripheral neuropathy. CIP is increasingly diagnosed in ICU
patients. The prevalence of CIP, however, is essentially unknown,
as are the risk factors of CIP. The aim of this study was to assess
the incidence of CIP and to define potential risk factors for CIP.
Methods A database analysis was performed on 1450 patients
admitted to the ICU of a tertiary care hospital between March
1998 and December 2003. Diagnosis of CIP was based on
clinical judgement confirmed by electrophysiologic evaluation.
Clinical, laboratory and haemodynamic variables were analysed for
risk prediction of CIP.
Results The overall CIP incidence was 3.3% (48 out of 1450
patients) with a continuous increase in the annual CIP rate (1.4%
in 1998 to 5.5% in 2003). CIP patients had higher APACHE II (17 ±
9 vs 21 ± 8; P = 0.002) and SAPS II scores (44 ± 22 vs 53 ± 16;
P = 0.01), a higher incidence of mechanical ventilation (1000/1402
vs 48/48; P = 0.0001) and renal support (266/1402 vs 22/48;
P = 0.0001), as well as a longer duration of mechanical ventilation
(median 4 vs 30 days; P = 0.0001), renal support (median 4 vs 11
days; P = 0.0001) and ICU stay (median 5 vs 36 days; P = 0.0001).
Furthermore a higher bicarbonate on admission was noted. In the
multivariate analysis, only high bicarbonate on admission (P = 0.0002)
and renal support (P = 0.0001) were independent risk factors for
the development of CIP. Evaluating factors associated with CIP (as
a cause or as a consequence), high bicarbonate (P = 0.0016),
duration of ICU stay (P = 0.0001) and duration of renal support
(P = 0.043) were independently associated with CIP.
Conclusion CIP is diagnosed in approximately 5% of ICU patients.
The incidence of CIP is rising, as are the ICU stay and severity of
disease. Development of CIP was associated with severity of
disease and ICU length of stay.

On the basis of previous published data, the Interliaison Committee
on Resuscitation has advised that unconscious adults with spon-
taneous circulation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest should be cooled
to 33°C during 24 hours when the initial rhythm was ventricular
fibrillation (VF) and the cause of the cardiac arrest is of cardiac origin.
We postulate that other rhythms might beneficiate from cooling as
well as cardiac arrest of noncardiac origin. We therefore started a

prospective study, and we compare the effect of cooling on long-
term outcome in patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest of
noncardiac origin or having rhythms other than VF.
Twenty-eight patients were included, 14 of them were subjected to
hypothermia after achieving return of spontaneous circulation
(ROSC) (hypothermia group), the remaining other 14 patients
were subjected to normothermia (normothermia group). The cause
of cardiac arrest was near asphyxia after strangulation or
secondary to choking. Other patients had asystole or pulseless
electrical activity (PEA) at the first rhythm assessment.
The postresuscitation phase was similar in both groups. In the
hypothermia group, the cooling was initiated either by surface or
intravenous cooling. The patient was cooled to 33°C as soon as
possible in the Emergency Department, and the temperature was
maintained for 24 hours. The re-warming phase was slowly started
24 hours later by increasing the body temperature by 1°C each 4
hours. No difference in complications was observed in the both
groups. Good neurological outcome was highly significant in the
hypothermia group (Table 1).

Introduction The Hypothermia after Cardiac Arrest (HACA) trial
assessed whether mild therapeutic hypothermia improved the rate
of good neurological recovery in patients successfully resuscitated
from ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac
origin. Animal data suggest protection of ischemic myocardium
with reduced temperature. We evaluated for a subset of patients of
the HACA trial the impact of mild therapeutic hypothermia on
myocardial injury.
Methods Post-hoc analysis of data of the HACA multicenter trial
for patients included at our study center. Patients after ventricular
fibrillation cardiac arrest were randomly assigned to mild thera-
peutic hypothermia of 32–34°C over 24 hours or to conventional
treatment. For the present analysis we analysed the effect on
plasma levels of CK and CKMB as a measure of infarct size.
Results Fifty-five patients underwent cooling and 56 patients
received standard treatment after successful resuscitation. The
analysis was performed according to the intention-to-treat
principle. The areas under the curve (AUC) within 24 hours for CK
were 28,786 U/l × 24 hours (IQR 5646–44,998) in the cooling
group and 20,373 U/l × 24 hours (IQR 8211–30,801) for controls
(P = 0.40). For CK-MB the AUC was 1690 U/l × 24 hours (IQR
724–3330) in the cooling group and 1187 U/l × 24 hours (IQR
490–2469) for controls (P = 0.18).
Conclusion In our sample cooling after successful resuscitation
for ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest did not influence infarct size
as estimated by CK and CK-MB levels.

Neuron-specific enolase and protein S-100 B as
prognostic parameters for children with head injury

University of Greifswald, Germany
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P464 (doi: 10.1186/cc4811)
Introduction Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) (glycolytic enzyme in
neurons and neuroendocrine cells) and protein S-100 B (calcium2+-
binding protein in astroglial and Schwann cells) are established
neurobiochemical markers that can be used for evaluating the
severity of organic brain damage. The examination of these
parameters in serum was used to show the practical relevance in
correlation with further examination criteria (Glasgow Coma Scale
[GCS], outcome, hospital treatment and ventilation time).
Patients and methods Thirty-nine boys and 16 girls aged 8 ± 4.7
years (range 2 months–16 years) suffering from light to severe
head injury (49.1% traffic accident, 38.2% falls, 3.6% child abuse,
3.6% riding accidents, 5.5% other accidents) were included in the
study. The examinations of NSE (reference <12 µg/l) and protein
S-100 B from the serum were performed using the Liason®
Analyser from Byk Sangtec and reagents from Diasorin. Both
markers were identified using an immunoluminometric assay
(sandwich test). For 52 patients NSE was measured and for 30
patients protein S-100 B was additionally detected after a
maximum of 12 hours after the trauma. The correlative behaviour of
both parameters towards each other, towards the sex of the
patients, the GCS groups (group 1: 4–8 points, group 2: 9–12
points, group 3: >12 points), the hospital treatment time, the
ventilation hours and the outcome were tested towards
significance (Mann–Whitney test).
Results Significant correlations for NSE and protein S-100 B were
seen for the outcome of patients with head injury. NSE (P < 0.01)
and protein S-100 B (P < 0.05) were significantly higher when
rehabilitation was necessary or death occurred. Children in need of
ventilation had significantly higher NSE (P < 0.01). Protein S-100
B did not behave comparably. Comparing the sex of the patients
and the GCS groups, no correlation of the parameters were found.
A total of 68.1% of the patients were dismissed home, 20% were
transferred to a rehabilitation facility, 12.7% were transferred to
another hospital and 5.5% of the patients died.
Conclusions NSE and protein S-100 B are closely correlated with
the severity of traumatic head injuries in childhood and young
adolescence. They should thus find more attention as prognostic
parameters in the intensive medical treatment of children.

Correlation of systemic protein S100ββ levels with
postoperative indicators of neurological damage in
supratentorial meningioma surgery

Hebrew University Medical Centre, Jerusalem, Israel
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P465 (doi: 10.1186/cc4812)
Background Elevated plasma levels of S100β, an astrocyte-derived
protein, correlate with neurological deterioration after cardiac surgery
[1] and with poor survival following hypoxia [2] and neurotrauma [3]
but remain unexplored during elective meningioma surgery. We
hypothesized that S100β levels correlate with this tumor’s
preoperative characteristics and with perioperative neurological
injury despite its supratentorial location and non-neural origin.
Methods All patients admitted for meningioma surgery (1 January
2004–31 October 2004) underwent prospective perioperative
clinical/radiographic (CT, MRI) neurological evaluation. S100β levels
were drawn upon admission and at 2, 24 and 48 hours post-
operatively and correlated with clinical/radiological characteristics.
Results Included were 52 patients aged 58.5 ± 13 years (median
60, range 30–80 years), mostly female (40/52). Preoperative mini-
mental scores averaged 26.6 ± 6.8 (median 29.5, minimum 11).
Several meningiomas were recurrent (14/52) and/or had been
irradiated (16/52). MRI demonstrated a mass effect in 35/52
patients. Average tumor and edema volumes were 35.29 ± 29.39 cm2
and 24.83 ± 32.39 cm2, respectively. Surgery was usually per-
formed via pterional/frontal approaches and averaged 5 hours. Post-
operative CT demonstrated infarct in three patients and bleeding
(average volume 1.13 ± 4.19 cm2, median 0, maximum 29.68 cm2)
in 22 patients. Preoperative S100β levels did not correlate with
tumor characteristics. S100β levels rose postoperatively and
remained elevated (Fig. 1). Greater elevations of S100β were
associated with poor quality of the surgical plane at 2 hours (P =
0.01), deterioration in the postoperative mini-mental score at 2 hours
(P = 0.008) and at 24 hours (P = 0.017), and postoperative
bleeding at 24 hours (P = 0.046) and 48 hours (P = 0.034).
Conclusions Systemic S100β levels perform poorly as a tumor
marker for patients with meningioma but provide early prediction of
postoperative neurological injury following meningioma surgery.

Introduction Cardiac arrest is a state of severe cerebral perfusion
deficit. Patients recovering from a cardiopulmonary resuscitation are
at great risk of subsequent death or incapacitating neurologic injury,
including a persistent vegetative state. An early definition of neuro-
logic prognosis for these patients has ethic and economic implications.
Objectives To investigate the prognostic value of serum neuron-
specific enolase (NSE) in predicting outcome in patients after a
cardiac arrest.
Methods Forty-five patients resuscitated from inhospital cardiac
arrest were prospectively studied from June 2003 to January 2005.
Blood samples were collected once in each patient, between 12
and 36 hours after the arrest, for NSE measurements. Outcome
was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)
6 months after the event. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to
compare patients with unfavourable outcome (Group 1, GOS 1, 2)
with patients with favourable outcome (Group 2, GOS 3, 4, 5).
Results Age and sex were not different between groups. Cardiac
causes were responsible for 37.2% of the cardiopulmonary
resuscitations. All nonbystander arrests occurred in Group 1.
Asystole was the most common arrest rhythm, more frequently
seen in Group 1 (P = 0.046). The mean score on the Glasgow
Coma Scale was 6.1 ± 3 in Group 1 and 12.1 ± 3 in Group 2 (P <
0.001). The mean time to NSE sampling was 20.2 ± 8.3 in Group
1 and 28.4 ± 8.7 in Group 2 (P = 0.013). Two patients were
excluded from analysis because of hemolysis. At 6 months, good
outcome was achieved in nine patients (19.6%), 30 patients
(69.8%) died and four patients (9.3%) evolved to a persistent
vegetative state. The 34 patients (81.4%) with unfavourable
outcome (GOS 1, 2) had significantly higher NSE levels than those
with a favourable outcome (median NSE 44.24 ng/ml, range
8.1–370 vs 25.26 ng/ml, range 9.28–55.41; P = 0.034).
Conclusion Outcome after a cardiac arrest is mostly determined
by the degree of hypoxic brain damage, and the serum NSE level is
a valuable early adjunctive parameter for assessing outcome in
these patients.

neurons and the neuroendocrine tissue of the brain. NSE is
released as a result of leakage across the injured neuronal
membrane; elevations of serum NSE are due to neuronal injury and
increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier. Protein S-100
(especially the B subunit) is a calcium binding protein found in high
concentrations specifically in neurogliar and Schwann cells.
Procalcitonin (PCT) is the precursor of calcitonin and under normal
conditions it is not detected in the plasma (0–0.5 ng/ml). PCT is
elevated in microbial sepsis and trauma.
Objective To investigate the validity of outcome prediction after
severe head injury using the serum levels of protein S-100 B, of
NSE and of PCT.
Materials and methods Over a period of 24 months (2003–
2004) 42 patients with severe head injury older than 18 years
treated in the ICU of KAT General Hospital, intubated and
mechanically ventilated, were prospectively included in the study.
The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee.
Informed consent was obtained from the next of kin of all patients.
The patients were 20 men and 12 women, without other injuries,
mean age 34 years and mean admission GCS 6. None of the
patients had spinal cord injury or any other previous neurological
disease. Venous blood samples were taken on admission (first day)
and consecutively on the second and third days. The
immunoluminometric assay was used for the specimens. We tried
to correlate the S-100 B, NSE and PCT serum concentrations with
the CT scan intracerebral pathology as well as with the age,
gender and ICU outcome.
Results All patients on admission had elevated S-100 B and NSE
serum concentrations but PCT was very little increased. There
were a gradual reduction from the first towards the third day of ICU
stay. The first day the mean values of S-100B were 3.74 µg/l and
the third day they were 1.8 µg/l (P < 0.001). The first day the mean
values of NSE were 21.7µg/l and the third day they were 18.2 µg/l
(P < 0.05). The first day the mean values of PCT were 1.38 ng/ml
and the third day they were 0.49 ng/ml (P = NS). Protein S-100B
levels and NSE were higher in patients who died (P < 0.001).
There was no strong correlation between the initial serum S-100 B
and NSE values, the CT scan findings, the GCS on admission, the
age of patients and the gender.
Conclusion The protein S-100 B and NSE are biochemical
markers that seem to be elevated during the first days after injury in
patients with severe head trauma. They could be used as markers
of the severity of the injury and with great probability as prognostic
markers of patient outcome. On the contrary, the PCT levels seem
to have no prognostic value in isolated severe head trauma,
although the PCT seems to increase in polytrauma patients.

Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P468 (doi: 10.1186/cc4815)
Objectives To evaluate the frequency and types of end-of-life
practices in five Brazilian pediatric intensive care units (PICU):
Porto Alegre (two), São Paulo (one) and Salvador (two).
Methods We conducted a cross-sectional and multicenter study
based on a retrospective chart review including every death
occurring between January 2003 and December 2004 in five
Brazilian PICU of university-affiliated and tertiary hospitals located
in Porto Alegre (two), São Paulo (one) and Salvador (two). Two
fellows of each service filled a standardized protocol, searching for
information regarding: demographic aspects, cause of death,
frequency of cardiopulmonary resuscitation register plans, and
medical practices in the 48 hours before death. The data were
compared using the Student t test, ANOVA, chi-square and RR.
Results A total of 332 death patients were identified in this period
and 37 cases of brain death were excluded (11.1%). The mortality
is similar in the five PICU. Only 120 (36.1%) patients had not been
reanimated, with a statistical difference (P < 0.05) between the five
PICU. Sixty-seven (55.8%) charts of non-reanimated patients had a
register of an end-of-life plan made by the assisting team: 41 cases
of life support limitation and 26 do-not-resuscitate orders, without
differences between the five PICU (P = 0.2). There were no cases
of withdrawing ventilatory support or a significant increase in
sedatives and analgesics doses in the 48 hours preceding death.
Conclusions Despite the increasing number of children who are
not reanimated in the end of life in Brazilian PICU, we observed
that withdrawing life-sustaining treatment preceding death is still
insignificant. Moreover, we observed different medical practices in
the five hospitals that can be a consequence of cultural, religious
or even personal behaviors of each medical team in the three
different Brazilian regions.

Objective Intact function of the alveolar epithelium is of critical
importance to resolve reperfusion edema after lung transplantation.
The mechanism, known as alveolar liquid clearance (ALC), can be
stimulated by β-adrenergic agents such as terbutaline. ALC in lung
grafts and the effect of terbutaline was evaluated in an isolated
reperfusion model comparing donor lung injury following brain
death in the heart-beating donor (HBD) versus 1 hour of warm
ischemia in the nonheart-beating donor (NHBD).
Methods Pigs were divided into six groups (n = 3/group). In HBD
and HBD-T, brain death was induced by intracranial balloon
inflation. In control animals, CONT and CONT-T, the balloon was
not inflated. In NHBD and NHBD-T, cardiac arrest was induced by
myocardial fibrillation. After 5 hours of mechanical ventilation, lungs
in HBD, HBD-T, CONT and CONT-T were flushed. In NHBD and
NHBD-T, unflushed grafts were explanted after 1 hour of warm
ischemia and 4 hour of in-situ topical cooling. Grafts in all groups
were evaluated for 2 hours in an isolated ventilation and
reperfusion model. At the start of reperfusion, 100 ml iso-oncotic
albumin solution was instilled in all lungs and mixed with 10–3 M

terbutaline in HBD-T, CONT-T and NHBD-T to stimulate ALC. The
ALC (percentage of alveolar fluid resorbed per hour) was
calculated by comparing the initial and final protein concentrations
in the instillate with the formula: 100 × (1 – initial protein / final
protein) / 2.

Data presented as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 compared with NHBD and CONT.
Conclusions ALC during isolated reperfusion is decreased
following brain death in HBD but not in NHBD. The effect of
terbutaline on ALC was mostly apparent in HBD. These data
further support the use of NHBD in lung transplantation.
Terbutaline may be a promising tool to stimulate epithelial function
in lungs from HBD and to resolve ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Introduction A variety of factors are believed to impact the number
of organs explanted for transplantation in cadaveric organ donors,
including age, stability of the patient and existing co-morbidities.
Brain-death-induced systemic inflammation could also adversely
affect the number of organs explanted for transplantation. Hence, in
this observational study we sought to examine the various factors
including the inflammatory response that occur in cadaveric organ
donors and to determine their relative impact on organ explantation.
Methods We enrolled 30 cadaveric organ donors in this
prospective observational, two-center study. After obtaining
informed consent, we collected clinical information including
demographics, cause of death and donor management details. We
measured plasma IL-6 levels at baseline and hourly for the first 4
hours after brain death and immediately before organ explantation.
We analyzed the association between the number of organs
explanted and clinical, demographic and immunologic variables by
univariate and multivariable regression. Finally, we repeated our
analysis on donors younger than 50 years of age.
Results The number of organs explanted from patients ranged
from 0 to 7, with an average of about three organs per patient. In
multivariable analysis, older age and female sex were the only
variables significantly associated with less than three organs
explanted (age: OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.81–0.96, P = 0.003; female
sex: OR = 0.13, 95% CI 0.02–0.76, P = 0.024). In subgroup
analysis, we found that in donors aged younger than 50 years (n =
17), female sex still had a significant negative impact on organs
explanted (P = 0.0002), but age was no longer significant.
However, in the younger than 50 age group the mean plasma IL-6
concentration was also negatively associated with the number of
organs explanted (P = 0.001).
Conclusion Age, as expected, appears to be the primary factor
impacting the number of organs explanted from cadaveric organ
donors. Surprisingly, female sex is associated with a decreased
number of organs explanted. In donors younger than 50 years of
age, female sex and mean plasma IL-6 concentrations significantly
impacted the number of organs explanted.

Is bispectral index monitoring an alternative method for
diagnosis of brain death?

Mersin University, Mersin, Turkey
Critical Care 2006, 10(Suppl 1):P471 (doi: 10.1186/cc4818)
Introduction EEG and cerebral angiography is usually mandatory
beside clinical examination for the diagnosis of brain death. In
recent years, for head trauma patients correlation was found
between the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the bispectral index
(BIS) that was dependent on the analysis of EEG. We studied
whether BIS monitoring is an alternative method or not.
Materials and methods Thirteen patients received in the ICU with
deep coma between February 2004 and September 2004 were
included in the study. GCS was ≤5 for all patients during ICU
admittance. The reasons for coma were intracranial hemorrhagia,
head trauma, cerebral anoxia. After the clinical diagnosis of brain
death was made, all patients underwent EEG monitoring. Clinical
inspection and EEG were made twice for 24 hours, BIS monitoring
was performed for 2 hours after the detection of brain death.
Results BIS values were 0 for 12 patients and 5 for one patient.
Bioelectric silence was detected in all EEGs of all patients.
Discussion BIS, which depends on bispectral analysis of EEG
parameters, is used in the ICU for evaluation of sedation level. A
meaningful correlation between neurologic status GCS and BIS has
been reported for coma patients without sedation. Our findings are
in line with these studies. BIS seems to be an alternative method for
diagnosis of brain death with the advantage of easy application.
However, EMG activity and cardiovascular hyperpulsatility may
cause artifacts and false BIS evaluations. We believe that more
studies are necessary for routine application of this new method.

Objectives Studies of brain death and organ donation in children
are scarce. The objective is to evaluate the incidence of brain
death (BD) as well the guidelines and protocols used for
confirming BD in five Brazilian PICUs: Porto Alegre, São Paulo and
Salvador.
Methods We conducted a cross-sectional and multicenter study
based on a retrospective chart review including every death
occurring between January 2003 and December 2004 in five
Brazilian PICUs of university-affiliated and tertiary hospitals located
in Porto Alegre (two), São Paulo (one) and Salvador (two). Two
fellows of each service filled a standardized protocol, searching
information regarding: demographic aspects, the death cause, the
diagnosis of BD and related protocols (or guidelines), and
subsequent management. The data were compared using the
Student t test, ANOVA, chi-square and RR.
Results A total of 332 death patients were identified in this period
and 37 of them (11.1%) were defined as BD. There was a different
rate between the five PICUs (18.2%, 10.1%, 14.7%, 4.8% and
Critical Care March 2006 Vol 10 Suppl 1 26th International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine

5.0%; P < 0.05). The median age was 50.5 months without
statistical difference related to gender. In 81% of the cases the
clinical diagnosis of BD was confirmed through cerebral blood flow
examinations (ultrasonography/scintigraphy) or EEG. The interval
between the diagnosis of BD and the interruption of vital support
as well the incidence of withdrawal vital support after the diagnosis
BD showed statistical difference (P < 0.01) between the five
PICUs. Only six (17.6%) children with BD were organ donors.
Conclusions Despite Resolution 1.480/97 of the Federal Advice
of Medicine published in August 1997 that in a clear and objective
way defines the criteria that must be adopted to establish the
diagnostic of brain death in Brazil, many services still have
tremendous difficulty adopting it. These difficulties were well
demonstrated when observing the number of patients that remain
with vital support after BD was established and the modest
number of organ donors in Brazil.
