Multiple genome screens have been performed to identify regions in linkage or association with Multiple Sclerosis (MS, OMIM
126200), but little overlap has been found among them. This may be, in part, due to a low statistical power to detect small
genetic effects and to genetic heterogeneity within and among the studied populations. Motivated by these considerations,
we studied a very special population, namely that of Nuoro, Sardinia, Italy. This is an isolated, old, and genetically
homogeneous population with high prevalence of MS. Our study sample includes both nuclear families and unrelated cases
and controls. A multi-stage study design was adopted. In the first stage, microsatellites were typed in the 17q11.2 region,
previously independently found to be in linkage with MS. One significant association was found at microsatellite D17S798.
Next, a bioinformatic screening of the region surrounding this marker highlighted an interesting candidate MS susceptibility
gene: the Amiloride-sensitive Cation Channel Neuronal 1 (ACCN1) gene. In the second stage of the study, we resequenced the
exons and the 39 untranslated (UTR) region of ACCN1, and investigated the MS association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms
(SNPs) identified in that region. For this purpose, we developed a method of analysis where complete, phase-solved, posterior-
weighted haplotype assignments are imputed for each study individual from incomplete, multi-locus, genotyping data. The
imputed assignments provide an input to a number of proposed procedures for testing association at a microsatellite level or
of a sequence of SNPs. These include a Mantel-Haenszel type test based on expected frequencies of pseudocase/pseudocontrol
haplotypes, as well as permutation based tests, including a combination of permutation and weighted logistic regression
analysis. Application of these methods allowed us to find a significant association between MS and the SNP rs28936 located in
the 39 UTR segment of ACCN1 with p = 0.0004 (p = 0.002, after adjusting for multiple testing). This result is in tune with several
recent experimental findings which suggest that ACCN1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MS.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disabling disease of the central nervous
system that affects young adults. Despite substantial evidence of
polygenic inheritance of MS, the Major Histocompatibility
Complex (MHC) is the only Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) region
where convincing evidence of linkage and association with MS has
been found repeatedly and consistently [1,2]. Multiple genome
screens have nominated over 70 regions in linkage or associated
with MS. Unfortunately, apart from some replications of linkage in
regions of Chromosomes 5 and 17 [3], little overlap outside MHC
has been found among these studies. Moreover, while each of the
linkage studies has shown more allele sharing among affected
individuals than would be expected by chance alone [4], none of
them has succeeded in demonstrating linkage with MS at
a genome-wide significance level. A possible explanation is the
absence of MS susceptibility genes with strong individual effects.
In addition, the statistical power to detect a modest effect may be
low due to genetic heterogeneity within and among the studied
populations. These considerations motivated our decision to study
an isolated, genetically homogeneous, old population of the Italian
province of Nuoro, Sardinia, where MS prevalence is 4–5 times as
high as in the Italian mainland. The main objective of this paper is
to report a genetic characterisation of MS in this very special
population, and the discovery of an MS association with genes on
Chromosome 17.
Our study is largely (but not exclusively) based on individuals
extracted from families with multiple MS cases, where the genetic
effect is expected to be stronger than in sporadic cases. Only a few
DNA markers were genotyped and tested. This was made possible
by adopting the following multi-stage design of the study. In the
first stage, five microsatellites in the 17q11.2 region were typed
and tested for MS association. One significant association was
found at microsatellite D17S798. Next, a bioinformatic screen of
the DNA region surrounding this microsatellite highlighted
a strong candidate MS gene, called ACCN1 (Amiloride-sensitive
Cation Channel Neuronal 1, ENSG00000108684). Subsequent testing,
exclusively of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) located in
ACCN1, revealed a significant association between MS and an
SNP in the 39 untranslated (UTR) region of that gene. This result

is corroborated by several recent experimental findings, from
independent sources, which we review in the Discussion section.
RESULTS
In 1998 we set up the current MS register in the province of
Nuoro; for each MS case, the register provides the multigener-
ational pedigree. All diagnoses of MS were in accord with Poser’s
criteria for clinical definite MS [5]. An early analysis of the register
data gave an estimated MS relative risk as high as 24 for
a proband’s sibling [6], and evidence that the risk of a proband’s
relative decreases with the degree of genetic sharing with the
proband [7]. This suggests the presence of a strong genetic
component of the disease in the studied population.
Our study sample consisted of a collection of small groups of
individuals, which we call nuclei, each nucleus having been
ascertained around an MS case, or proband, extracted from the
above register. Most probands were extracted from a multiplex
family, in consideration of the fact that cases with a strong family
history of MS are more likely to exhibit an increased frequency of
a particular susceptibility allele than sporadic cases [8]. We had 78
nuclei for a total of 229 individuals. The nuclei were subdivided
according to type: 44 type-1 nuclei consisting of a proband and of
his/her parents, plus occasionally the proband’s siblings; 22 type-2
nuclei consisting of the proband, of his/her spouse and of their
children, and 12 type-3 nuclei consisting of a proband and of
a corresponding unrelated control, matched by village of origin.
Proband’s siblings were present in five out of the 44 type-1 nuclei,
with three nuclei including one sibling and the remaining two
nuclei containing two. A large proportion (76.5%) of the 78
probands involved in our analysis was diagnosed during the
relapsing-remitting stage of the MS course, and 38 of them were
extracted from multiplex families with a varying number of
affecteds.
Following the study design outlined in the Introduction, in the
first stage of our analysis we separately tested for MS association
five microsatellites under an MS linkage peak in the 17q11.2
region of DNA (for details see Genomic region and marker
selection, data preparation and genotyping and Supplementary
Table S1). In a previous meta analysis of three genome screens in
the American, British and Canadian populations [9], this region
had the highest linkage score for MS outside the MHC, with a non
parametric logarithm of the odds (LOD) score of 2.58. Three types
of association test, GLOBAL, LOCAL and regression-based
(REG), are reported for each microsatellite in Table 1 (for an
explanation of these tests see Statistical Analysis). Note that
a consistently significant signal across the three tests is found only
at microsatellite D17S798, with a p-value for the global null
hypothesis of no association as low as 0.002, according to our
REG test. The fact that the association signal found at D17S798
does not extend to the two microsatellites located about 2cM away
from it is consistent with the fact that we found no evidence of
linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the studied microsatellites.
These findings may sound surprising when one considers that
Zavattari et al. [10], in a work on Sardinian isolates published
before the design of our study, estimated a 2cM persistence of LD
between microsatellites. However, our findings are consistent with
a very recent investigation on LD in Sardinia, notably by Service et
al. [11], giving evidence that the extension of LD in old isolates,
including the Nuoro population, is not as high as was expected.
In our analysis of D17S798 we found that no alleles, except 1, 5
and 6, were sufficiently frequent in the studied population to
contribute significant evidence of their association, given the
available sample size. A comparison of the pseudocase vs
pseudocontrol frequency for allele 5 (64 vs 43) and for allele 6
(52 vs 75) suggested that alleles 5 and 6 had a deleterious and
protective effect, respectively, whereas allele 1 (31 vs 30) appeared
to be neutral. Allele 6 of D17S798 had the most significant
permutation-adjusted p-value according to both our REG test
(pr1 = 0.002) and our LOCAL test (pr1 = 0.03). Next came allele 5,
with the second most significant permutation-adjusted p-value
according to our REG test (pr2 = 0.003) and to our LOCAL test
(pr2 = 0.034).
Next we performed a bioinformatic screening of the DNA
region surrounding D17S798, extending to the next studied
microsatellite, on both sides. A map diagram of this region is
shown in Figure 1. The only known genes in this region are
MYO1D (Myosin-Id, ENSG00000176658) TMEM98 (Transmembrane
protein 98, ENSG00000006042), SPACA3 (Sperm Acrosome Associated
3, ENSG00000141316) and ACCN1 (the longest on chromosome
17). MYO1D is expressed in many tissues and codes a protein
belonging to the family of unconventional myosins, playing its role
in intracellular movements. TMEM98 codes a small transmem-
brane protein of unknown function, while SPACA3 codes an intra-
acrosomal sperm protein mainly expressed in human spermatozoa
and probably participating in the process of sperm-egg fusion
during fertilization. Finally, ACCN1 [12,13] encodes the Mamma-
lian Degenerin protein, a proton-gated channel permeable to
sodium, lithium and potassium. The function of these channels is
to generate ionic currents involved in the transmission of the
nervous signal. While it cannot be excluded that MYO1D,
TMEM98 or SPACA3 are involved in MS pathogenesis, ACCN1
immediately appeared to be the only strong MS susceptibility
candidate gene in the region explored (see the Discussion section
for further bio-epidemiological evidence pointing at ACCN1).

Our subsequent analysis was entirely focused on the ACCN1
gene, that extends from 50 Kb to 900 Kb away from D17S798.
Direct sequencing of all the ten exons of this gene and their
flanking regions (introns and UTR regions) highlighted 28 SNPs.
These are described in Table 2. Of these, the five SNPs typed in
bold in Table 2 were selected for testing, the selection criterion
being based on minor allele frequency and quality control (for
details see Genomic region and marker selection, data preparation
and genotyping, and Tables S2 and S3). The last two columns of
Table 3 report p-values for the null hypothesis of no association,
for each of the five selected SNPs. These are permutation-adjusted
in such a way to control for family-wise error rate under five-fold
testing.
Out of the five SNPs tested, only rs28936 and rs28933 appear to
be significantly associated with MS, the former being significantly
associated under both the LOCAL and the REG test. These two
SNPs are closer to D17S798 than any of the remaining three SNPs
we have tested, and very close to each other. rs28936 and rs28933
were also in full LD with each other (D9 = 1, R2
= 0.91, see Tables
S4 and S5). In Table 3, the p-values obtained by using our REG
test (for details see Statistical analysis: regression based tests of
association section) are consistently lower than those obtained by
using the LOCAL test. This may be due to a greater sensitivity of
the REG test, owing to the fact that it incorporates the uncertainty
due to the imputation of haplotypes. By means of logistic
regression we also estimated the effect size for SNP rs28936,
corresponding to an odds ratio of 2.07 (1.4–3.1 95% CI) for the A
allele of this SNP, under a multiplicative model. In a conditional
analysis performed by using weighted regression (for details see
Statistical analysis: regression based tests of association section),
when we conditioned on the most significant SNP, rs28936, no
residual association was provided by the remaining four SNPs,
suggesting no evidence of multiple effects operating across the
studied SNPs. However, after conditioning on SNP rs28936,
residual association was still detected at the D17S798 micro-
satellite (p-value = 0.03), suggesting that another effect might
operate within ACCN1, or in a different gene, or in a non-coding
region in LD with D17S798. Note that our tests for association
tended to be conservative, since they were based on haplotypes
imputed under the null hypothesis of no association.
Finally, we tested for disease association the haplotype formed
by D17S798 and SNP rs28936. Based on both our LOCAL and
our REG test (giving minp values of 0.044 and 0.025, respectively)
we could reject the null hypothesis that no variant of that
haplotype was associated with disease. The ‘‘5.A’’ haplotypic
variant, representing a combination of allele 5 of D17S798 and the
‘‘A’’ allele of SNP rs28936, had 43.8 expected pseudo-cases vs 22.5
expected pseudo-controls, which suggested a deleterious effect of
this variant. By contrast the ‘‘6.G’’ variant, with 22.1 expected
pseudocases vs 46.5 expected pseudocontrols, appeared to have

Panel B maps the position of four known genes (blue rectangles) in the region around D17S798, where a horizontal line represents DNA sequence,
and a pink bar marks the location of microsatellites D17S798 and D17S1800. The diagram conveys the fact that TMEM98 and SPACA3 (represented
above the horizontal line) lie on the forward helix, whereas Myo1D and ACCN1 (represented below the horizontal line) lie on the reverse helix. Panel C
zooms on gene ACCN1, showing the locations of the genotyped markers relative to D17S798, in Kb. In this latter panel, the horizontal line represents
genomic DNA, the pink dots represent the SNPs we have genotyped, the pink vertical bar represents microsatellite D17S1850, the blue bars represent
ACCN1 exons and the wavy solid line between exons corresponds to the ACCN1 introns. The ACCN1 gene is located on the reverse strand, so the
portion of ACCN1 near D17S798, where SNP rs28936 and SNP rs28933 are located, is the 39 UTR-exon10 region of the gene. The width of the introns
and exons in panel C is proportional to the actual length, with the exception of the first three very long introns (right portion of the panel) which
have been shortened. Gaps are represented by diagonal bars: three bars (intron1-2) = 1,043,911 base pairs; two bars (intron 3–4) = 60,470 base pairs;

a protective effect. The remaining variants (‘‘1.A’’, ‘‘1.G’’, ‘‘5.G’’,
‘‘6.A’’) appeared to have a neutral effect. Indeed, the variants
‘‘6.G’’ and ‘‘5.A’’ had the most significant and second most
significant associations, respectively, with a p-value (pr1) for variant
‘‘6.G’’ as low as 0.027 in our REG test (and pr1 = 0.044 in our
LOCAL test), and a p-value (pr2) for variant ‘‘5.A’’ as low as 0.025
in our REG test (and pr2 = 0.069 in our LOCAL test). The
adjusted p-values for the ‘‘6.G’’ and ‘‘5.A’’ variants were
considerably larger than the p-value for SNP rs28936 alone.
DISCUSSION
We have studied MS association in the genomic region 17q11.2 in
the isolated population of Nuoro, Sardinia. In the first stage of our
study we analysed five microsatellites scattered across an in-
dependently discovered MS linkage peak in 17q11.2. We found
one significant MS association at microsatellite D17S798. Of the
known genes surrounding this microsatellite, ACCN1 was identified
to be the best MS susceptibility candidate on the basis of external,
a priori, information. This prompted us to resequence the exons
and the 39 UTR segment of ACCN1, where SNPs were identified
and tested for MS association. Two SNPs (rs28936 and rs28933)
in the 39 UTR region of ACCN1 gave significant marginal
associations after adjusting for five-fold SNP testing. Confidence in
a genuine association is strengthened by the fact that the two most
significant associations were found on two SNPs that occupy
adjacent positions in the sequence of tested markers, and,
moreover, by the fact that both these significant SNPs have a high
frequency of the minor allele. Moreover, consider that the effect
size for the deleterious allele of SNP rs28936, on an odds ratio
scale, was as high as 2.07 (1.4–3.1 95% CI). Odds ratios of this
magnitude are not unexpected in a genetically homogeneous, high
disease prevalence, population. The power to detect such an effect
by our method, given our sample size, is greater than 87% for any
value of a greater than 0.01. Recall that our method, due to the
particular permutation procedure, may lose sensitivity in those
situations where the conditioning on nucleus founders is un-
necessary. When we conditioned on SNP rs28936, no residual
association was provided by the remaining four SNPs, suggesting
no evidence of multiple effects operating across the studied SNPs.
In the following we discuss (i) current knowledge about the biology
of ACCN1, and (ii) external evidence supporting an involvement of
ACCN1 in MS. Finally we shall suggest a possible role of ACCN1 in
the aetiology of MS, in the light of the available evidence.
The ACCN1 gene, a member of the family of amiloride sensitive
cation channel acid sensing ion channels [13], encodes the
Mammalian Degenerin (MDEG, Q16515) protein, a proton-gated
channel permeable to sodium, lithium and potassium. The
function of these channels is to generate ionic currents involved
in the transmission of the nervous signal. MDEG has two isoforms,
MDEG1 and MDEG2, with different biological properties [14].
MDEG1, expressed in the postsynaptic membrane of granule cells
and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, can form an active
ionic channel either as a standalone, or by binding other proteins
of its family, and is activated by a low pH. MDEG2, expressed in
the brain and in sensory neurons, cannot form an active ionic
channel as a standalone, but participates in an heterodimeric
active ionic channel by interacting with another protein of its
family. For example, MDEG2 interacts with the Amiloride-sensitive
Cation Channel 3 (ACCN3) to form a channel where the ionic current
is modulated by the Protein Kinase C, presumably the alpha
isoform, [15] via shared interaction with the Protein Kinase C
Alpha Binding Protein (PRKCABP), an adaptor protein encoded
by the Protein Interacting with C Kinase 1 (PICK1,
ENSG00000100151) gene. Interestingly, an heteromer formed
by the above proteins is involved in the sensation of pain caused by
low pH values. Furthermore, there is evidence that MDEG
participates in mechanosensation, perception of taste, perception
of pain and possibly in neurotransmission and neuromodulation
[16]. In addition, mice knock-out experiments have shown that it
is required for normal light-touch sensation [17]. See [16] for
a review of current understanding of the ACCN1 gene and its
family, including their potential pathogenetic role and the
possibility of therapeutic modification. The hypothesis of an
involvement of ACCN1 in MS is well within the realms of
possibility, as indicated by the following experimental, clinical and
epidemiological evidence:
1. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations of MDEG
homologues known as degenerins (deg-1, mec-4, mec-10) are
the major known causes of hereditary neurodegeneration,
according to experimental literature [12].
2. The MDEG1 channel is constitutively activated in the
presence of the same mutation that causes degeneration in
the nematode [12]. This has led to the suggestion that a gain
of function of the MDEG1 channel might be involved in
human forms of neurodegeneration.

3. A link between ACCN1 and neurodegeneration, suggested in
the above two points, appears particularly interesting in the
light of recent evidence that the primary insult in MS may
indeed be of a neurodegenerative (rather than inflammatory)
kind [18]. Such a kind of insult, it is suggested in [18], might
bring in its wake a harmful autoimmunity, itself causing
further collateral damage to neurons, in the context of
a positive feedback link that might well set the pace of
a progressive neuronal injury at certain stages of MS or in
some MS patients.
4. An involvement of a deregulated ion channel in MS has been
reported [19]. More specifically cerebellar ataxia, a sign that
accompanies MS, seems to be due to an increased expression
of sensory-neuron-specific sodium channels in the Purkinje
cells, leading to increased ionic current inside the cells and to
consequent alterations in cellular functions.
The following points also indicate, albeit rather indirectly,
plausibility of an involvement of ACCN1 in MS:
N there is now evidence that susceptibility to common autoim-
mune disorders such as Type 1 diabetes, Graves’ disease and
autoimmune hypothyroidism [20,21] may largely depend on
genetic variation in untranslated genic regions, possibly
involving a modification of the localization, stability or splicing
of the messenger Ribonucleic Acids (mRNAs). This suggests
that a deregulated expression of ACCN1, possibly an over-
expression resulting in an increased ionic current when the
channel is activated, may underlie our finding of an MS
association at the rs28936 polymorphism in the 39 UTR region
of ACCN1;
N an association between the Protein Kinase C alpha (PRKCA,
ENSG00000154229) and MS has been observed in the Finnish
and Canadian populations [22]. In the light of the previously
discussed functional link between the Protein Kinase C alpha
and MDEG2 (encoded by the ACCN1 gene), the above finding
provides indirect prior evidence in favour of a genuine
involvement of ACCN1 in MS patho-genesis, thereby adding
weight to the results of our analysis. These findings, combined
with the results our study, point to a possible interaction
between PRKCA and ACCN1 in the context of MS association,
a possible target for future investigation;
N the region 17q11.2 where ACCN1 gene is located is syntenic to
the Eae18b QTL on rat Chromosome 10. This locus of
approximately 3Mb in length was found to be associated with
the murine model of multiple sclerosis EAE (Experimental
Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis), displaying maximum LOD
scores in the range 4.5 to 5.8, depending on the EAE
phenotype. The ACCN1 gene is included in this linkage interval
and the peak linkage marker D10Rat123 is internal to the gene
[23].
We would add that secondary inflammation in MS, as long as it
is accompanied by acidosis, might activate the MDEG1 ion
channel, and consequently lead to cell death in the context of
a progressive, inflammation-mediated, neurodegenerative process.
Our results point to a family of ion channels which are considered
to be potential drug targets because they are involved in
neuropathic pain. If the above hypotheses are true, future drugs
for neuropathic pain might work also in the treatment of MS,
perhaps as a prophylactic measure to prevent inflammation in the
early stage of the disease, or in combination with immunosup-
pressor drugs in the subsequent stages of the disease. In our
opinion, the above considerations motivate further experimental
and epidemiological investigation of the role of ACCN1 in MS
aetiology. Finally, our statistical results do not exclude presence of
other SNPs within (or in the proximity of) ACCN1, that are also
associated with MS, thereby motivating future, more extensive,
exploration of the genomic region in the vicinity of D17S798.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genomic region and marker selection, data
preparation and genotyping
Table S1 describes the five high heterozygosity microsatellites
which we selected for typing in 17q11.2. Some were used in
previously mentioned genome screens, or located near markers
used in previously published work.
All the ten exons of ACCN1 and their flanking regions (introns
and UTRs) were directly sequenced, which led to identifying 28
SNPs. All of these were found in non-coding regions, with the
exception of the SNP 1147090 found in exon number 10. This
non-synonymous SNP leads to a Pro499Ser substitution; however,
we excluded it from the association analysis due to the very low
minor allele frequency. Of the 28 identified SNPs, the five SNPs
highlighted in bold in Table 2 were selected for inclusion in the
association analysis. The criteria for selection were: (i) a minimum
call rate of 90%, (ii) consistency with Hardy-Weinberg Equilib-
rium (HWE) in founders at a p-value $0.01 (iii) presence of
homozygous genotypes of major/minor alleles and presence of the
heterozygous genotype, (iv) heterozygosity greater than 0.25, (v)
a minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 10%. The choice of
10% as a threshold for MAF was motivated by the fact that, given
our sample size, an SNP with an MAF below 10% cannot
contribute appreciable evidence of an association.
From the schematic diagram of Figure 1 it appears that two of
the five selected SNPs are located in the 39 UTR region flanking
exon 10, two are located within intron 8–9, and one is located in
intron 6–7. Because ACCN1 is a very long gene, with as many as
ten exons and with the longest intron (intron 1–2) in its
chromosome [24], our chosen SNPs do not provide a complete
coverage of it, with the exception that the 39 UTR portion of the
gene was found to contain all the tag SNPs listed in the HapMap
Project (see http:// www.hapmap.org [25]) for that portion of the
gene. Moreover, we improved the coverage by including in the
analysis the microsatellite D17S1850, located within the gene in
the intron 1–2. Exon sequencing details are given in Tables S2 and
S3. The blood sample collection was performed at the Division of
Neurology, S.Francesco Hospital, Nuoro (I); the buffy coat
preparation and the DNA extraction, according to classical salting
out protocol, were performed at the Centro di Tipizzazione
Tissutale of the Azienda Sanitaria Locale Nu3, Nuoro, where the
biological bank resides. Further DNA extraction from buffy coat,
microsatellite typing and gene sequencing were performed at the
Centre National de Genotypage, Evry, France (see http://www.
cng.fr/).
Statistical analysis
In a classical trio study, an ascertained proband is genotyped along
with his or her parents to form a proband-parent trio. The present
study extends this design by including two further ascertainment
schemes. In the first, a proband is genotyped along with his or her
spouse (and possibly their offspring). In the second, an isolated
proband is recruited into the study to act as an isolated case
with a corresponding control, matched by village of origin. Our
study embraces all these three ascertainment schemes, by
including proband-parent trios, which we call type-1 nuclei,
proband-spouse-offspring trios, which we call type-2 nuclei, and
ACCN1 and Multiple Sclerosis

matched case-control pairs, which we call type-3 nuclei. A founder is
any individual who has no parents included in his/her own
nucleus. Thus, in a nucleus of type 1 or 2 the two parents are the
founders, whereas in a nucleus of type 3, where there is no
offspring, both the proband and the corresponding matched
control are founders.
Pseudocases and Pseudocontrols
We regard a family-based association study as a special case of
matched case/control analysis, where each nucleus contributes
pseudocases and pseudocontrols. Biernacka and Cordell [26] define
pseudocases and pseudocontrols at a genotype level. We favour the
following, different, option: in type-1 nuclei, we define the
pseudocases to be the two parental haplotypes transmitted to the
proband, and the pseudocontrols to be the remaining two parental
haplotypes. In type-2 nuclei, we define the pseudocases to be the
two haplotypes found in the proband, and the pseudocontrols to
be those found in the spouse. In type-3 nuclei, we define the
pseudo-cases to be the two haplotypes found in the proband, and
the pseudocontrols to be those found in the proband’s matched
control. Under a null hypothesis of no disease association at the
studied loci, any haplotype variant should be approximately
equally frequent in the pseudocases and in the pseudocontrols,
under each of the three different ascertainment schemes. We pool
the three types of nuclei into a joint analysis which looks for
haplotype variants that are significantly more (or less) frequent in
the pseudo-cases than in the pseudocontrols. A large disparity
between the pseudocase and pseudocontrol counts, for any
particular haplotypic variant, may be taken to indicate evidence
of an association. In the spirit of the Transmission Disequilibrium
Test [27], our analysis acknowledges the mutual matching of
pseudocases and pseudocontrols in the same nucleus.
One reason for choosing a haplotype-level analysis, rather than
a genotype-level one, is that in the presence of occasional
genotyping failures the missing allele calls can be imputed by
‘‘borrowing strength’’ from information about the neighbouring
loci, so as to exploit linkage disequilibrium over the studied DNA
region. Given a set of genotyping data, at multiple loci, we
estimated the (imperfectly observed) haplotypic phase and, at the
same time, imputed any missing calls at a particular locus by
combining information about population-level haplotypic frequen-
cies with information about the neighbouring loci. The ability to
‘‘borrow strength’’ from information about neighbouring loci will
attenuate the impact of biased missingness, for example when an
SNP is preferentially losing heterozygotes. The method avoids the
need to eliminate families with ambiguous haplotypes, which
would incur bias, and moreover allows tests of association to be
performed at a haplotype level, whenever appropriate [28,29].
Reconstructing the Haplotypes
Our data include incomplete genotype measurements in the
studied founders, denoted by GF, incomplete genotype measure-
ments in the offspring, denoted by GO, and the ascertainment
status of each studied individual, represented by a vector D
pointing at individuals with an ascertainment proband status.
Unknown quantities in the problem are complete haplotype
information for all founders, HF, and complete haplotype
information for all offspring, HO. We use data (GF,GO, D) to
make inferences about (HF,HO), under the assumption that (i) no
recombinations within the studied DNA region occur in the
parent-to-offspring meioses, and that (ii) genotyping error is
absent. Violations of the latter assumption were preliminarily
checked by looking at locus-specific deviations from HWE, and at
mendelian consistency between parental and offspring genotypes.
Consider the Bayesian posterior for HF, denoted as p(HF) and
proportional to P(HF,GF,GO,D). Because under a null assump-
tion of no disease association D is independent of (HF,GF,GO), we
may write:
p(HF)!P(HF,GF,GO)~P(GFjHF,GO) P(GOjHF) P(HF),
where stands for ‘‘proportional to’’. Because GF is a deterministic
function of HF, and therefore independent of GO, once we know
HF, we may simplify this as follows:
p(HF)!P(GFjHF) P(GOjHF) P(HF):
Under assumption (ii) above, P(GF|HF) indicates logical consis-
tency between the founder haplotype assignments, HF, and the
corresponding observed genotypes, GF. The term P(GO|HF), in
type-1 and type-2 nuclei, reflects mendelian consistency between
founder haplotypes and observed offspring genotypes (depending
on the proportion of patterns of transmission of the parental
haplotypes which match the observed offspring genotypes). The
term P(HF) represents prior assumptions about the population
distribution of haplotypes (see below).
We use the MCMC-based PHASE software [30] to draw from
p(HF) samples of HF, denoted HF(1)
, HF(2)
, …, HF(M)
. In this
software, P(HF) is shaped around the population genetics model
proposed by Stephens et al [31]. Next, in order to identify the
pseudocases and the pseudocontrols in each nucleus, we associate
each HF(i)
, (for i = 1,…,M), with a corresponding sample of HO,
denoted by HO(i)
, extracted from P(HO| HF(i)
,GO). Note that
P(HO|HF,GO) specifies in each nucleus the probability of any
particular haplotype assignment in the offspring, conditional on
the founders’ haplotypes and on the available genotyping data. We
end up with a set {(HF(i)
,HO(i)
)} of samples whose empirical
distribution approximates the posterior distribution of (HF,HO).
From these samples, we obtain the probability of any particular
pseudocase/control assignment in any particular nucleus, which
enables us to generate a reconstruction table. This is a table where
each row corresponds to a distinct, posterior-weighted, pseudo-
case/control assignment in a particular nucleus. Each nucleus
generally contributes separate rows in the reconstruction table, one
row for each distinct pseudocase/control assignment with positive
probability in the posterior, for that nucleus. Shown in Table 4 is
a pedagogic example of a reconstruction table with only three
nuclei represented in it. In this example, the first row represents an
assignment where founder 1 of nucleus 264 has haplotypes AGT
and AAC, both acting as pseudocases, whereas the third row
represents an assignment where founder 1 of nucleus 1121 has
case haplotype GGT and control haplotype AAC. In our analysis,
each pseudocase or pseudocontrol haplotype in the table was
defined over the complete sequence of DNA loci under study. In
the last column of the table, a (posterior) weight gives the relative
proportion of times that any particular haplotype assignment in
a particular nucleus was generated by the Markov chain. Recall
that the reconstruction table has been generated under a null
hypothesis of no association. Any test of association based on such
a table, including the tests we are going to propose, will tend to be
conservative, as a consequence of this fact.
A GLOBAL Test of Microsatellite Association
The p-values in column 3 of Table 1 have been obtained by
separately applying to each of a set of five microsatellites the
following GLOBAL test of association. Let our global null
ACCN1 and Multiple Sclerosis

hypothesis, H0, assert that none of the m alleles of a microsatellite
is associated with the disease. To reject/accept H0 as a whole, we
proceed as follows. From the reconstruction table we obtain, by
weighted averaging, the expected frequency of copies of allele j
that are pseudocases (tij) and pseudocontrols (uij) in nucleus i, for all
relevant combinations of i and j. By summing over the nuclei we
obtain dj = Si(tij2uij), and d = (d1, …, dm). A marked departure of
dj from zero indicates a deleterious (or protective) effect of allelic
variant j on disease risk. Under H0 we can freely interchange the
entire vector ti = (ti1, …, tim) with ui = (ui1, …, uim), with probability
0.5, independently in each i-th nucleus. Under the resulting
permutation distribution, d has zero expectation and variance
covariance matrix V: {vhk = Si(tih2uih)(tik2uik)}. A global test of H0
can be based on the fact that under such permutation distribution
the statistic Z = d’V2
d (where V2
denotes the generalized inverse of
V) has an asymptotic x2
m{1 distribution. Because the test is per-
formed under a null permutation distribution which conditions on
the set of founder haplotypes in each nucleus, it is robust to popula-
tion stratification differences between nuclei. Due to the presence of
type-3 nuclei, the method is not robust to population stratification
differences within the nucleus founders. The problem is attenuated by
the fact that we study an isolated population, and that we match the
two founders of each type-3 nucleus by village of origin.
LOCAL Tests via Permutation
The above, global, test may be undersensitive when departure
from the null hypothesis is entirely explained by one or few alleles
of a highly polymorphic microsatellite. We may then consider the
following, alternative, LOCAL test procedure. Each allele is
compared against the group of all others by forming a 262 table of
pseudocase/control expected frequencies, generated by weighted
averaging over the reconstruction table. Let T be the largest of the Z
statistics of 262 tables, each of which compares one allele against all
others. To obtain an empirical p-value for H0, denoted minp, we
compare T with its distribution under random permutations of the
reconstruction table. These are performed by randomly inter-
changing the pseudocase with the pseudocontrol haplotypes, with
probability 0.5 independently in each row of the reconstruction
table. The same properties of robustness we have mentioned in the
context of our GLOBAL test hold for this LOCAL test. It should be
noted that, when we omit the pseudocase/control labels of the
haplotypes, the reconstruction table does not provide information
about the null hypothesis of no disease association, yet it is
representative of the uncertainty about nuisance parameters related
to the unobserved haplotypic phase and missing allele calls. By
testing association via permutations of the pseudocase/control labels,
independently in each row of the reconstruction table, we come close
to conditioning on the values of a complex set of nuisance
parameters unrelated to the null hypothesis.
A comparison between columns 3 and 4 of Table 1 shows a clear
tendency of the minp calculated through the LOCAL test to be
more sensitive than the test of the previous section, in the study of
our microsatellites. A similar procedure we have used to test
association of the five SNPs of the ACCN1 gene. First, we have
calculated a separate unadjusted p-value for each SNP, essentially
by treating it as a bi-morphic microsatellite so that the test of the
previous section could be applied. We have then ordered the
unadjusted p-values for the various SNPs such that
pr1#pr2#…#prm. In order to adjust for multiple SNP testing,
each prj is then transformed into a corresponding adjusted p-value,
prj, using the permuted replicates of the reconstruction table we
had previously generated in the analysis of microsatellites. From
each of these replicates, an ordered set of p-values for the various
SNPs, Pr1#Pr2#…#Prm, is obtained. Essentially, we calculate prj
as the proportion of replicates where prj is equal to or less than
min(Prj, …#Prm), with a possible modification required to ensure
monotonicity of the {prj} [32,33]. The procedure ensures a strong
control of the family-wise error rate under multiple SNP testing.
Column 5 of Table 3 contains p-values calculated through the
procedure just described. Because our permutation procedure
preserves correlation between SNPs, the reported p-values
acknowledge non-independence of the tests.
Regression-Based Tests of Association
The test procedures described so far are based on expected
pseudocase/control frequencies, and therefore ignore uncertainty
due to haplotype reconstruction. An alternative, inspired by
a paper by Cordell [34], is to use the following REG test based on
unconditional logistic regression [35,36]. With reference to our
analysis of the five SNPs of Table 3, the idea is to perform
a separate regression analysis on each individual SNP. In the
regression, each of the four haplotypes in each row of the
reconstruction table is treated as an independently observed
response/covariate pair, where the response is 0 for a pseudocon-
trol and 1 for a pseudocase, and where the covariate represents
presence/absence of the minor allele in the SNP of interest. By
opting for the ‘‘weighted logistic regression’’ option found in most
statistical packages, we allow the observations contributed by any
particular row of the reconstruction table to enter the regression
with a relative importance fixed by the corresponding posterior
weight. For each jth SNP, we obtain a corresponding estimate of
the relative risk parameter, bj, and a corresponding Wald’s statistic

and p-value. The p-values (one for each SNP) are then
permutation-adjusted to account for multiple SNP testing.
Embedding Cordell’s regression approach within a permutation
scheme protects from the possibility that the weighting scheme
used in the regression does not rigorously correspond to a likeli-
hood in a specific model of the data. Because of its ability to
incorporate haplotype assignment uncertainty, the REG test
should be more sensitive than the LOCAL test, and the results
of Table 3 seem to confirm this. We also used an extension of the
above REG procedure, where a permutation-based p-value for the
hypothesis of no association of a target marker is computed by
adjusting for the effect of a conditioning marker. This simply requires
including a covariate term for both the conditioning and target
markers in the regression equation.
The data management and the statistical analysis of the
reconstructed haplotype configurations, according to the proposed
methods, were performed with the aid of the software package
GADA (Genetic Association Downstream Analysis), written in R
by one author (CB).
