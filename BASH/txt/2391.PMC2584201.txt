OBJECTIVE — To examine the epidemiologic association between diabetes and risk of non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We searched MEDLINE for observational
studies on the association between diabetes and NHL in adults using the keywords “diabetes” and
“lymphoma.” Prospective cohort studies that reported relative risks or standardized incidence
ratios and case-control studies that reported odds ratios with 95% CIs were included. A random-
effects model was used to combine results from the individual studies.
RESULTS — A total of 15 manuscripts (reporting data from 5 prospective cohort and 11
case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria. Combining data from all studies, the risk ratio
(RR) of developing NHL in patients with diabetes was 1.19 (95% CI 1.04–1.35). Based on
prospective studies, patients with diabetes had an RR of developing NHL of 1.41 (1.07–1.88),
without heterogeneity among studies (I2
ϭ 34.3%; P Ͼ 0.10). Based on case-control studies,
patients with diabetes had an RR of 1.12 (95% CI 0.95–1.31) of developing NHL compared with
people without diabetes, with some heterogeneity among studies (I2
ϭ 36.28%; P ϭ 0.09).
CONCLUSIONS — Diabetes is associated with a moderately increased risk of NHL, which is
consistent with other reported associations between diabetes and malignancies. Future studies
should focus on elucidating potential pathophysiologic links between diabetes and NHL.

T
he incidence of non-Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma (NHL), a heterogeneous
group of conditions characterized
by uncontrolled growth of monoclonal
malignant lymphocytes, has been increas-
ing in Western countries over the last few
decades (1). The increase has been more
pronounced in whites, men, and the el-
derly (1). NHL is now the ﬁfth most com-
monly diagnosed cancer among both men
and women and accounts for 4% of all
cancer diagnoses (1). Several hypotheses
have been proposed to explain this in-
creased incidence, including aging of the
population, exposure to pesticides, pro-
longed survival of patients with immuno-
deﬁciency states (including HIV), and
increased prevalence of autoimmune dis-
eases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic
lupus erythematosus, Sjo¨ gren’s Syn-
drome, and multiple sclerosis).
In parallel with the increasing inci-
dence of NHL, the prevalence of diabetes
has increased over the last few decades
(2). Diabetes has been associated with in-
creased risk of several malignancies, in-
cluding endometrial, ovarian, breast,
gallbladder, liver, colonic, and pancreatic
cancer (3–7), but its relationship with
NHL is unclear. Individuals with diabetes
are believed to have altered immune func-
tion and to be in a relatively immuno-
deﬁcient state (8), which may contribute
to the pathogenesis of lymphoprolifera-
tive disorders, such as NHL (9). Further-
more, there is a growing body of evidence
linking insulin and IGF-I to cell prolifer-
ation, lack of apoptosis in cells, and cell
metastasis (10)—phenomena involved in
the development and progression of
malignancies.
An association between diabetes and
NHL was initially reported 40 years ago
(11). Since then, several studies have ex-
amined this association in different pop-
ulation- and hospital-based settings with
inconsistent results. The objective of this
study was to perform a systematic review
and meta-analysis of observational stud-
ies to estimate the risk of NHL in patients
with diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Data search
We conducted a search of MEDLINE (1
January 1980 through 30 April 2008) for
observational cohort and case-control
studies reporting an association between
diabetes and NHL using the keywords
“diabetes” and “lymphoma.” We searched
for additional studies in personal refer-
ence lists and citation sections of recov-
ered articles.
Study selection
Two authors ( J.M. and J.C.) screened ab-
stracts according to the inclusion criteria.
An abstract was judged relevant if it re-
ported original data, was published in the
English language, and was from epidemi-
ological studies where the outcome vari-
able was NHL and the predictor variable
was diabetes (any type). Prospective co-
hort studies reporting relative risks or
standardized incidence ratios with 95%
CIs and case-control studies reporting
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were in-
cluded in the meta-analysis. Manuscripts
reporting only data on Hodgkin’s disease
and multiple myeloma were excluded be-
cause the pathophysiology of these con-
ditions is different from that of NHL (12).

cancers besides NHL, we extracted the
data on NHL only. Full-text articles, in-
cluding letters to the editor, were re-
trieved and reviewed if a decision on
inclusion could not be made based solely
on the abstract. Any discrepancies were
resolved by consensus in-group confer-
ence referencing the original article.
When there were multiple publications
from the same population, we included
data from the most recent one. We did not
contact the authors of the original manu-
scripts for additional data.
Data extraction
The following data were extracted from
each study: author, country of origin,
publication year, participant characteris-
tics (age and sex), sample size, inclusion
and exclusion criteria, and methods of di-
agnosis of diabetes and NHL. For cohort
studies, we extracted the source of cohort,
the follow-up period, the source of the
expected incidence of NHL, relative risk
or standardized incidence ratio with 95%
CI, and variables adjusted for in the sta-
tistical analysis. For case-control studies,
we extracted the source of case and con-
trol subjects (e.g., hospital based and
population based), OR with 95% CI, and
variables adjusted for in the statistical
analysis. Ascertainment of exposure (self-
reported versus registry based) and extent
of multivariate adjustment were used to
evaluate study quality. Data were ex-
tracted by one author (J.M.) and indepen-
dently veriﬁed by another (A.G.P.).
Data synthesis and analysis
The primary measure was risk ratio (RR)
of NHL, calculated using the random ef-
fects model (DerSimonian-Laird method),
which accounts for heterogeneity among
studies (13). Because the absolute risk of
NHL is low, the OR in case-control studies
mathematically approximates the RR
(14); therefore, we report all results as
RRs. To assess heterogeneity among the
studies, we used the Cochran Q and
I2
statistics; for the Q statistic, a P
value Ͻ0.10 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant for heterogeneity (15); for I2
, a
value Ͼ50% is considered a measure of
severe heterogeneity (16). Subgroup anal-
yses were performed for sex and for type
of diabetes. We assessed publication bias
using the funnel plot, which plots relative
risk (or OR) by sample size. When data
were not uniformly reported to allow for-
mal statistical analyses, we present the
data in a narrative format. Data were an-
alyzed using MIX version 1.7 (17), a
comprehensive free software for meta-
analysis of causal research data that has
been validated against STATA (StataCorp;
College Station, TX) and Comprehensive
Meta-analysis (Biostat; Englewood, NJ),
two of the most utilized meta-analysis
software tools.
RESULTS
Search results
A total of 540 abstracts were identiﬁed
during the initial search (Fig. 1). After re-
view of the abstracts, 514 were ineligible
because they were reviews, editorials,
case reports, comments, or preclinical
studies. After reviewing the reference list
of the remaining 26 studies, 8 more stud-
ies were considered. After detailed evalu-
ation of the 34 potential manuscripts, 19
manuscripts were excluded for reasons
shown in Fig. 1.
Characteristics of prospective
studies
We identiﬁed ﬁve prospective cohort
studies of diabetes and risk of NHL (Table
1) (5,6,18–20). Studies were published
between 1997 and 2006 and included
more than 160,000 participants with dia-
betes; participants were followed for 6 to
25 years, reporting a total of 337 incident
cases of NHL. The diagnosis of diabetes
was self-reported in two studies (6,18)
and was registry based in three studies
(5,19,20). All studies included histologi-
cally conﬁrmed cases of NHL. Two stud-
ies excluded NHL cases that were
reported during the ﬁrst 1 or 2 years of
follow-up to minimize the impact of se-
lection bias (6,20). None of the studies
mentioned whether participants with
HIV infection were excluded.
Three studies reported relative risk
(6,18), whereas the remaining three re-
ported standardized incidence ratio
(5,19,20). With the exception of two
studies (6,18), investigators did not ad-
just risk for potential confounders other
than age and sex. One study was per-
formed in a women-only cohort (18).
Characteristics of case-control
studies
We identiﬁed 10 manuscripts reporting
data from 11 case-control studies pub-
lished between 1988 and 2007 (Table 2)
(7,21–29). A total of 382 cases of NHL
were reported among 4,844 patients with
diabetes, whereas a total of 7,974 cases of

NHL were reported among 86,660 con-
trol subjects without diabetes. The diag-
nosis of diabetes was self-reported in all
studies. The diagnosis of NHL was patho-
logically conﬁrmed in all studies with the
exception of one study that conﬁrmed the
diagnosis of NHL through a review of
medical records (27). Control subjects
originated from a population-based
(7,21,22,26–29) or hospital-based set-
ting (23–25). All studies adjusted their
result for age. Eight studies adjusted for
sex (21,23–29), two for BMI (7,24), three
for ethnicity (7,21,28), two for level of
education (7,25), and one for country of
origin (29). Four studies excluded indi-
viduals with HIV infection (21,24,27,29).
Two studies included only men (7,22).
Analyses
After combining data from all studies
(prospective and case-control), the RR of
NHL in patients with diabetes was 1.19
(95% CI 1.04–1.35) (Fig. 2). Visual ex-
amination of the funnel plot revealed
minimal asymmetry. In prospective stud-
ies, the RR for NHL among patients with
diabetes was 1.41 (95% CI 1.07–1.88),
without heterogeneity among studies
(I2
ϭ 34.3%; P Ͼ 0.10). Among case-
control studies, the increased risk of NHL
among patients with diabetes was not sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (1.12 [0.95–1.31])
but had a mild degree of heterogeneity
(I2
ϭ 36.28%, P ϭ 0.09).
Diabetes and NHL by sex
We then combined data from the three
prospective (6,18,20) and four case-
control (7,22,25,28) studies that re-
ported risk of NHL according to sex.
Female patients with diabetes had a sta-
tistically signiﬁcant increased risk of
developing NHL (RR 1.38 [95% CI 1.06–
1.80]). In men with diabetes, there was no
increased risk of NHL (0.98 [0.79 –
1.22]). No heterogeneity was detected in
these subgroup analyses.
Type of diabetes and NHL
Along with one study that identiﬁed type
of diabetes by national registry (5), sev-
eral studies used the age of onset of dia-
betes (18–21,24,29) as a proxy for a pre-
sumptive diagnosis of type 1 or type 2
diabetes(Tables1and2).Combiningdata-
bases from patients with type 1 diabetes
(age of onset younger than 30 years), the
pooled RR was 1.27 (95% CI 0.82–1.99),
without evidence of heterogeneity (I2
ϭ
0.0%; P Ͼ 0.10). In patients with type 2
diabetes (age of onset older than 30

1.85), but with heterogeneity between
studies (I2
ϭ 57.9%; P ϭ 0.04).
Duration and severity of diabetes
and NHL
There were limited and conﬂicting data
on duration and severity of diabetes and
risk of NHL, which were not uniformly
reported, making formal statistical analy-
ses impossible. Two studies reported a
positive association between diabetes and
risk of NHL with increasing duration of
diabetes (5,18); however, in another
study, the risk of NHL continuously de-
creased with increasing time of follow-up
(20). In case-control studies, Fortuny
et al. (24) showed an increased OR of
NHL in individuals who had diabetes for
more than 12 years compared with pa-
tients without diabetes, whereas Scotti et
al. (25) reported no increased risk of NHL
with longer duration of diabetes.
Diabetes therapy and NHL
There were limited data on therapy for
diabetes and risk of NHL, which did not
allow for formal statistical analyses. Cer-
han et al. (18) reported an increased risk
of NHL in women with diabetes who were
on oral antidiabetic therapy (relative risk
3.43 [95% CI 1.67–7.07]), but the risk
became nonstatistically signiﬁcant in
women who were on oral antidiabetic
therapy and concurrent insulin (relative
risk 2.13 [0.78–5.79]). Fortuny et al.
(24) reported an increased risk in pa-
tients with diabetes not on pharmaco-
logical therapy (OR 1.73 [1.11–2.68]),
whereas the risk in patients treated with
oral antidiabetic therapy and/or insulin
was not statistically signiﬁcant.
CONCLUSIONS — Our analyses
showed that patients with diabetes have
an increased risk of developing NHL com-
pared with those without diabetes. Al-
though the size of the increased risk was
moderate, based on the projected increase
in the incidence and prevalence of diabe-
tes (2), our ﬁndings suggest a concurrent
increase in the incidence of NHL.
NHL is a malignant disorder charac-
terized by an uncontrolled growth of
monoclonal lymphocytes, observed most
commonly within the lymph nodes. NHL
is a heterogeneous condition and com-
prises several different morphologic sub-
types with distinct clinical behaviors and
outcomes. The increase in NHL incidence
over the last few decades is part of a longer
trend documented since 1950 (1), and
improved medical technology and chang-
ing systems of diagnostic classiﬁcation
can explain only part of it. Many medical
conditions have been associated with in-
creased risk of developing lymphoma,
including congenital or acquired immu-
nodeﬁciency states (HIV [30] and post
transplant [31]), autoimmune diseases
(e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, and Sjo¨gren’s Syndrome)
(32,33), and different infectious agents
(34) such as human T-cell lymphotrophic
virus type I, hepatitis C virus, Helico-
bacter pylori, Chlamydia psitacii, and Bor-
relia sp. What most of these conditions
have in common is immune dysregula-
tion (9). Indeed, the risk of developing
NHL among patients in immunosup-
pressed states is several times greater than
that of the general population (30,31).
However, these immunocompromized
states are relatively rare and cannot fully
explain the long-term and large increase
in NHL incidence. Our ﬁndings of an in-
creased risk of NHL associated with dia-
betes may provide an explanation for the
increased incidence of NHL not associ-
ated with rare immunosuppressed states.
It is increasingly recognized that not only
type 1 but also type 2 diabetes is charac-
terized by immune dysfunction related to
impaired neutrophil activity and changes
in cellular and humoral immunity (35),
which may, at least in part, account for
the increased risk of NHL that we found
in this study.

subjects (patients without diabetes).

DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 31, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2008 2395
The majority of patients with type 2
diabetes are obese; therefore, the ob-
served association between diabetes and
NHL may be mediated by metabolic de-
rangements associated with the obese
state. It is increasingly recognized that ex-
cess body fat is associated with increased
risk of common and less common malig-
nancies (36). A recent meta-analysis also
found an increased risk of NHL with ex-
cess body weight (37). The increase in
NHL associated with excess body weight
might be mediated by changes in circulat-
ing adipocytokines, such as adiponectin
and leptin. These cytokines are thought to
be involved in immunity and inﬂamma-
tion and can alter the balance between cell
proliferation and death. Studies in vitro
and in animal models indicate that adi-
ponectin has anti-inﬂammatory properties
and reduces cell proliferation, whereas lep-
tin has proinﬂammatory properties and
promotes the growth of certain cancer cells.
In vitro studies have shown that leptin
stimulates the proliferation of normal
hematopoietic cells as well as circulating
monocytes producing proinﬂammatory
cytokines, such as tumor-necrosis factor
and interleukin.
Treatment of diabetes, rather than the
disease pathophysiology itself, may also
be of etiologic importance. For example,
adverse reactions to sulfonylureas include
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone
marrow aplasia, and hemolytic anemia,
but these clinically apparent conditions
are relatively rare, and tumor-inducing ef-
fects have not been reported. Further-
more, various types of insulin are also
known to be immunogenic. Based on the
reviewed studies, we were unable to reach
any conclusions on a potential link be-
tween therapy and NHL risk. Also, any
potential treatment effects may be con-
founded by duration of the disease.
The increased risk of NHL in patients
with diabetes was observed in both pro-
spective and case-control studies but was
statistically signiﬁcant only among pro-
spective studies. The disparity may be at-
tributed to a variety of study-speciﬁc
factors, including the relatively small
number of cases, the failure to take con-
founding factors into account, and recall
bias that may have resulted in misclassiﬁ-
cations of type and duration of diabetes.
Our subgroup analysis showed that
the risk of NHL in women with diabetes is
38% higher compared with women with-
out diabetes, but the risk in men was not
increased. These ﬁndings are in contrast
with the reported increased ratio of
lymphoproliferative disorders in men
compared with women. Although our
ﬁndings may represent a true associa-
tion between diabetes and NHL that oc-
curs only in women, our results may be
limited by the small number of studies
that reported data by sex.
Based on the age of diagnosis as a
proxy for type of diabetes, the risk of NHL
appeared to be higher in patients with
type 2 diabetes (older than 30 years) than
in those with type 1 diabetes (younger
than 30 years). However, the results for
neither subgroup analysis were statisti-
cally signiﬁcant.
Our study has certain limitations
based on the quality of the published
studies. First, although some studies con-
ﬁrmed the diagnosis of diabetes, most
used self-report of diabetes as the predic-
tor. A positive self-report for diabetes is
generally quite accurate in epidemiologic
studies (38). Second, the type of diabetes
was not conﬁrmed. Most studies used age
as a proxy criterion for the two most com-
mon types of diabetes (type 1 and type 2).
Severity, duration, and treatment of dia-
betes were also not reported in most stud-
ies. Third, our observed association may
be due to confounding, as most prospec-
tive studies did not control for potential
confounders, including HIV status of par-
ticipants. Finally, our systematic review
was restricted to articles in the English
language, which may have inﬂuenced the
results. However, there is also evidence
that some countries publish unusually
high proportions of positive results
(39), which would introduce publica-
tion bias.
In conclusion, our analysis shows
that diabetes is associated with moder-
ately increased risk of NHL, which is con-
sistent with other reported associations
between diabetes and malignancies. Al-
though the relative risk is moderate, given
the rapidly increasing incidence and
prevalence of diabetes, the number of in-
cident cases of NHL attributed to diabetes
can potentially be very high. Future stud-
ies should focus on elucidating potential
pathophysiologic links between diabetes
and NHL.
