Background to the debate: In December 2004 three news
stories in the popular press suggested that the side
effects of single-dose nevirapine,which has been proven
to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV,had been
covered up.Many HIV experts believed that the stories
were unwarranted and that they would undermine use of
the drug,leading to a rise in neonatal HIV infection.The
controversy surrounding these stories prompted the PLoS
Medicine editors to ask health journalists,and others with an
interest in media reporting of health,to share their views on
the roles and responsibilities of the media in disseminating
health information.
Gary Schwitzer:The Agenda-Setting Role
of Health Journalists
Some journalists say that their role and responsibility is no
different in covering health information than it is in covering
politics, business, or any other topic. These journalists say
that their primary concern is accurate, clear reporting—they
are less concerned about the consequences of their story
once it is published [1]. But that approach may result in
shoddy journalism and potential harm to the public [2]. I
assert that it isn’t sufﬁcient to be accurate and clear when
covering health news. Journalists have a responsibility to
mirror a society’s needs and issues, comprehensively and
proportionally [3]. Often that doesn’t happen in health news.
Recently, I led an effort by the Association of Health Care
Journalists to publish a statement of principles [4]. “Journalists
have a special responsibility in covering health and medical
news,” the statement reads. “Association members know that
readers and viewers may make important health care decisions
based on the information provided in our stories.”
In our current era of entanglement, journalists must
investigate and report the possible conﬂicts of interest among
sources of health information and those who promote a new
idea or therapy. Such conﬂicts may not be readily apparent,
so journalists must look for them as a routine part of story
research and interviews. They must investigate and report the
possible links between researchers and private companies,
researchers and public institutions, patient advocacy groups
and their sponsors, celebrity spokespersons and their
sponsors, and nonproﬁt health and professional organizations
and their sponsors. To fail to do so may mean that journalists
become unwitting mouthpieces for incomplete, biased, and
imbalanced news and information.
Journalists face unique challenges in covering health news.
Some specialized skills, knowledge, and judgment are helpful.
For example, some information based on poorly designed
or poorly powered studies should not be reported unless the
ﬂaws are emphasized.
Editors, reporters, and writers need to scrutinize the
terminology used in health news. Vague, sensational terms
(such as “cure,” “miracle,” and “breakthrough”) may harm
news consumers by misleading and misinforming [5]. At the
core of journalism’s values, such terms should not be used
because they are meaningless.
It is not the role of journalists to become advocates for
causes. However, I believe that journalists have a responsibility
to investigate and report on citizens’ needs as they struggle
to understand and navigate the health-care system. People
need help in understanding the ways in which scientists and

policymakers reach conclusions. In that sense, there is an
inherent educational role that journalists must assume.
I have a special interest in how television journalists
cover health and health policy news. Surveys consistently
show that many Americans get most of their health news
and information from television. One study documented
troubling trends of brevity (an average of 45 seconds per
story), absence of reporter specialization, sensational claims
not supported by data, hyperbole, commercialism, disregard
for the uncertainty of clinical trials, baseless predictions
of treatments based on basic science studies, single-source
stories, and a paucity of coverage of health policy [6].
Television viewers are likely to see many more one-sided
political ads about health policy issues than balanced,
comprehensive news stories about such issues. In my current
research, I am analyzing health policy news coverage on three
award-winning TV stations in three different parts of the
United States in 2004. Despite the fact that American voters
ranked health care as their third leading concern (after war
and the economy) [7], the three stations I monitored devoted
little time to health policy issues. My analysis shows that in
ten months (326 hours of stations’ key late night newscasts)
on these three stations, there was only one story on the
uninsured. Presidential candidates’ health policy platforms
drew a combined total of seven minutes of news—an average
of 23 seconds per story, or about 15 seconds per station per
month of the 2004 campaign. Whether it is preclinical news
that is not ready for prime time, or clinical news that oozes
optimism over unproven ideas, or a disdain for health policy
news, television journalists seem to have abdicated their
possible agenda-setting role.
Journalists must weigh the balance between the amount of
attention given news about medicine and the attention given
news about health and the social determinants of health.
There may be too much news about the delivery of medical
services and not enough news about the cost of, quality of,
and evidence for those services. The current imbalance may
contribute to the nation’s health-care cost crisis, driving
up demand for expensive, unproven ideas. These are
responsibilities journalists may not encounter in covering
other topics. In health news, they are everyday issues.
Ganapati Mudur:The Media May Be the Most
Important Source of Health Information for the
General Public
Health reporting does involve “telling a story,” but it also
requires writers to take on additional responsibilities through
the story cycle—ﬁnding the story, collecting information, and
writing it.
Standard news criteria such as timeliness and impact may
be used to pick stories. But in health reporting, context is
crucial. Research advances to be reported need to be placed
in context. This may be achieved by citing earlier research
on the topic and seeking out comments from independent
experts who could put a new ﬁnding in perspective.
Sometimes health research throws up contradictory ﬁndings.
Is a gene linked to a disease? One study ﬁnds a link.
Another does not. Such situations demand interpretative
and analytical skills on the part of health writers. Otherwise,
writers may mislead readers, or leave them confused.
Health reporters need to ﬁnd out who has funded the
research and who might be likely to gain. And reporters
must always double-check claims or else they may end up in
embarrassing situations. Let me illustrate with an example.
A top international science magazine last year reported
that a novel stem cell therapy had cured patients with
chronic aplastic anemia in Bombay, India [8]. The story was
apparently based on claims made by the developers of the
therapy, a private British company. A little more patience
and investigation would have led the magazine to the real
story: none of the patients had responded to the treatment,
and the clinical collaborators in India had terminated the
study [9].
When a public health situation is involved, health writers
and the media can certainly play a role in quickly delivering
important messages to the public. In a sense, then, they do
serve as a component of the health provider community.
And this makes it all the more important for health writers
to ensure that they get it absolutely right. Given that most
people do not interact with their doctors on a regular basis,
the media is possibly the most signiﬁcant source of health
information for the general public. But health information in
the media cannot substitute for personal medical advice. It is
important that the public understands this.
Regulatory mechanisms may be lax in some developing
countries. India, for instance, has had a long history of
unethical or illegal clinical trials. Drug regulatory authorities

in India allow the sale of drugs—including pediatric
formulations—that have never been approved in Western
countries. This opens up opportunities for investigative
health journalism, an opportunity for reporters to take up
the traditional watchdog role of the press to ﬁnd and report
wrongdoing.
David Henry and Amanda Wilson:Health
Journalists Should Discuss Beneﬁts and Harms
of New Treatments and Use Independent Expert
Sources
Health reporting is a major growth area for the media,
probably because it is in demand by the public and it is
proﬁtable. However, media coverage of medical news is
generally of poor quality, particularly stories about new
treatments [10–12].
Media Doctor is a Web site where the quality of stories
in the Australian press is reviewed (www.mediadoctor.org.
au). We rate articles using ten evaluation criteria (see Box
1; www.mediadoctor.org.au/content/ratinginformation.
jsp). In February/March 2005 articles that we rated achieved
an average of only 52% on our “satisfactory” score (www.
mediadoctor.org.au/content/sourceinfo.jsp). This was an
improvement on the score from one year ago, but it is still
inadequate. North American analyses of the quality of health
reporting have had similar results [11]. The print media are
clearly superior to the online news services [12]. The greatest
differences between print and online services are in the use
of independent information sources, and the quantiﬁcation
of the beneﬁts and the coverage of potential harms of new
treatments.
We recognise that there are different depths of journalism
and that journalists face constraints, including commercial
pressures and deadlines that give little time to reﬂect on
stories, which are usually written on the same day as the
press release arrives. Some journalists argue that the media
are the messengers and not the message, and it is up to
others to interpret their reporting. To a reporter who might
otherwise exercise more caution, a well-written media release
from a large public relations company describing a new
pharmaceutical product must be attractive when a deadline
is imminent. There is no danger that the company will allege
plagiarism if it appears, almost intact, under the journalist’s
by-line.
And even when they do have the time, journalists face two
major challenges—understanding the clinical science and
epidemiology, and dealing with powerful vested interests.
Vested interests are not unique to medicine, but reporting
on a new drug is different from, say, an MP3 player or a
dishwasher. People will be intensely interested in a story
about a new drug if it purports to treat a condition that
they or their relatives have, and the story may become the
basis of discussions with their physician and subsequent
treatment decisions. We believe that in writing this type of
story journalists have special responsibilities to ensure that
they provide balanced information for their readers. In
Australia, the Press Council believes the matter is of sufﬁcient
importance to provide advice to journalists [13].
In our view journalists will meet their responsibilities if
they cover certain key issues when writing stories about new
medical treatments. These include the accurate reporting of
the comparative beneﬁts, harms, and costs of the treatment
and the extent to which their informants have ties with the
manufacturer. It is helpful if journalists use independent
expert sources to answer questions about the novelty of the
treatment and the availability and efﬁcacy of alternatives,
although we acknowledge the practical difﬁculties in ﬁnding
independent sources when time is limited. Journalists have
indicated to us that they are concerned about these issues
and are prepared to look critically at their own practices. It is
unclear whether their editors and producers hold the same
views and will provide the necessary resources, particularly
time to do the job properly.
But researchers and medical journal editors have
responsibilities too. When reading medical news stories it
is sometimes possible to tell whether the researchers and
journals have done a good or bad job in communicating the
essential facts to journalists. A number of medical journals
issue press releases, and these have been found wanting
[14]. Researchers should consider carefully what they wish
to convey about the results of a new study and should ask to
see and edit any press releases. We believe the criteria used
by Media Doctor to evaluate news stories are a good starting
point for researchers and editors.
Merrill Goozner:Medical Reporters Must Get
Beyond the Hype and Hope When Reporting
on the Latest“Breakthrough”
When I broke into the news business, the ﬁnancial desk’s
primary source of breaking news was a Dow Jones wire
clack-clack-clacking in the corner of the room. A bell rang
whenever a major story broke. Sometimes two bells would
go off, signaling a really big story. The day the stock market
crashed in 1987, the newsroom sounded like St. Peters Square
on Easter.
Box 1.Criteria Used by Media Doctor to Evaluate
News Stories
• Whether the treatment is genuinely new
• The availability of the treatment in Australia
• Whether alternative treatment options are mentioned
• If there is evidence of disease mongering in the story
• If there is objective evidence to support the treatment
• How the beneﬁts of the treatment are framed (in relative or
absolute terms)
• Whether harms of the treatment are mentioned in the story
• Whether costs of the treatment are mentioned in the story
• Whether sources of information and any known conﬂicts of
interest of informants are disclosed in the article
• Whether the journalist relied only on the press release for the
story

editors have responsibilities too.
PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 0579
I imagine something comparable occurs these days when
the advance copies of leading medical journals cross science
editors’ computer screens. Stories from the frontiers of
medical research can make it onto page one—the most
coveted real estate in daily journalism. News magazines have
bolstered their sagging bottom lines with an endless stream of
cover stories touting the latest breakthroughs in medicine.
But is this news all that it is cracked up to be? Have the
reporters properly weighed the importance of the studies
they’re touting? Have they asked the tough questions of the
researchers and their sponsors to ﬁgure out the signiﬁcance
of the results? Have they presented the data in a fashion that
is meaningful to health-care consumers? And in an age when
most clinical trials are sponsored by private companies, have
they fully informed their readers of the researchers’ conﬂicts
of interest?
Too often, the answer to these questions is no. Take
recent reports from the American Society of Clinical
Oncology, which met in mid-May in Orlando. One leading
paper reported on a Veterans Administration review of
the experience of over 40,000 women in the south central
US. “The women taking statins were half as likely to have
breast cancer as women who were not taking the drugs,” the
paper reported [15]. Put that way, it sounds like a dramatic
reduction. But elsewhere in the story, it was reported that 12
percent of the women were taking the cholesterol-lowering
medications and that only 1.4 percent of the total group
contracted breast cancer. Only by massaging the numbers
could one ﬁgure out that physicians would need to put 700
women on statins to eliminate one cancer case (in medical
parlance, this is called number needed to treat). It sounds a
lot less impressive that way. But the number needed to treat
would be a lot more meaningful to women, especially those
on tight budgets wondering if it is worth $1,000 a year for a
prescription.
Reporting of surrogate endpoints instead of primary
endpoints is another way that readers get misled. Reports
on cancer drug trials often fall into this trap. A “lifesaving”
drug that shrinks tumors by 50 percent sounds a lot better
than a chemotherapy agent that prolongs life by two months.
The same can be said for bone density and fractures, blood
pressure and strokes, and cholesterol levels and heart attacks.
While there may be a minor yet statistically signiﬁcant
reduction in the primary endpoint, the trial sponsors prefer
to promote the more dramatic-sounding secondary endpoint.
Too many reporters prominently feature the less meaningful
number, while leaving out or delaying until late in the story
the real bottom line [16].
Sadly, the media have only lately come around to taking
seriously the issue of conﬂicts of interest in medical science.
Last July, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s
National Cholesterol Education Project updated its guidelines
for cholesterol management. The update, touted in the
front page of every major US paper [17], called for a
dramatic reduction in the cholesterol levels now considered
optimal for people who have never had heart disease but are
considered moderately at risk. Prescribing physicians using
these guidelines will likely put millions more Americans on
these drugs in the next few years.
Yet three days after the report came out, reporters at
Newsday broke the story that eight of nine physicians on the
National Cholesterol Education Project panel had ﬁnancial
ties to statin manufacturers, which had the most to gain from
the new guidelines. Writing in the Washington Post, former
New England Journal of Medicine editor Jerome Kassirer asked,
“Why should we swallow what these studies say?” [18] The
ensuing uproar contributed to a change in policy at the New
York Times, which last fall circulated a memo to all reporters
encouraging them to always report conﬂicts of interest of
quoted sources in science stories, a policy that leading science
and medical journals have had in place for many years [19].
In recent years the pharmaceutical and biotechnology
industries have responded to complaints about the high cost
of drugs by claiming they are needed to ﬁnance the medical
miracles that are just around the corner. Meanwhile, the
increase in life expectancy in the US has slowed and still
remains far below other advanced industrial countries. The
number of new drugs coming out of industry labs, despite a
slight uptick last year, is actually down from a decade ago. In a
health-care environment that is increasingly cost-constrained,
it shouldn’t be too much to ask that medical reporters get
beyond the hype and hope when reporting on the latest
“breakthrough.”
Maria Simbra:Whatever News Managers Want,
Viewers Get—As Medical Reporters Are Pressed
to Feed the Media Beast
Reporters are surpassing doctors as a source of medical
information. It’s no secret health news sells. Producers and
news directors take advantage of this to attract an audience
for their newscasts. And viewers respond.
In a survey by Rodale Press, 39% of the respondents said
they turn to TV for health and medical information, and 37%
said they would ask a health professional [20].
So as audience-appointed proxies for “health professionals,”
television medical reporters have a daunting task. They must
be accurate, authoritative, and compassionate. They also need
to understand the terminology, physiology, epidemiology,
study design, and statistical analysis to keep health news in
context for the viewer.
But typically, this doesn’t happen. The medical industry
churns out volumes of information for medical reporters
to quickly sift through every day. There’s a lack of special
training for medical journalists (the general assignment
reporter can expect to get thrown into the medical beat
from time to time). Usually local news reports are under 90
seconds. The pressure for ratings compounds the problem.
Medical news is often simpliﬁed, or worse, sensationalized,
because of industry pressures. Because health news sells, it
can be and will be promoted—and in the process, distorted.
What is a medical reporter to do? Well, alone, there’s not
much a reporter can do. Like medical errors, the problems
with medical journalism are system wide. At the root is a clash
of cultures.
Medicine tends to be very methodical, slow, and subject to
change. But the media want information that’s deﬁnitive, they
want it now, and, boy, it better be sensational. Also, people

Reporting of surrogate endpoints is
another way that readers get misled.
PLoS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org 0580
who go into journalism and ascend to management tend to
be more inclined toward writing and creative interests. They
may not understand (or may be openly hostile toward) the
scientiﬁc process.
For TV reporters who are committed to the medical beat,
educational opportunities are available through organizations
such as the Association of Health Care Journalists (www.
ahcj.umn.edu) and the National Association of Medical
Communicators (www.ibiblio.org/namc). Journalists can
learn how to interpret studies and present evidence-based
balance in order to help viewers understand and make up
their own minds about the latest developments in medicine,
rather than just show the gee-whiz side of new technology.
Unfortunately, it’s rare to ﬁnd a TV reporter who
exclusively covers medicine. Stations view this as a luxury. It
is more common for medical reporters to also be general-
assignment reporters or anchors, and they have other
priorities with their combination jobs.
It’s also rare to ﬁnd management that’s supportive of
continuing education for their reporters. Even with the large
proﬁt margins at many TV stations, news directors generally
do not provide ﬁnancial support and ask that reporters
interested in attending educational meetings use their
own vacation time to do so. Furthermore, news directors,
producers, and promotions staff don’t seem to be themselves
interested in learning about medical reporting.
An article in JAMA says that viewers are acting on and
making personal medical decisions based on health
information in the mass media [21]. This trend has led
some TV medical reporting experts, such as Gary Schwitzer
(formerly of CNN, now at the University of Minnesota, and
a contributor to this PLoS Medicine debate) and Dr. Timothy
Johnson (ABC News), to call for credentialing of medical
journalists. After all, some meteorologists are credentialed.
Are personal health decisions less important than the
weather?
There’s a disconnect between what station management
values, what the reporters need, and what the viewers get.
Right or wrong, the audience looks to TV medical reporters
to educate and guide them on medical issues. It’s an
important responsibility that medical reporters and the mass
media in general need to take seriously.
Melissa Sweet:Remember the Commercial
Imperative When Examining Media Coverage
of Health
Many people make the mistake of using the terms
“journalists” and “the media” interchangeably. They speak,
in the same breath, of the terrible failings of journalists and
the media in covering health or other issues. In so doing, they
fail to make a distinction between the craft or profession of
journalism and the competitive industry that is the media. They
fail to understand that the goals and drivers of journalism are
often in conﬂict with those of the media industry.
The foremost goal of the media industry is, not
surprisingly, to make proﬁt. Many journalists are too idealistic
to admit, even to themselves, that their job is to make money
for their employers. Some believe they are there for the
public interest, or even to interest the public. Some simply
love to tell a yarn, to get the buzz that comes with uncovering
a great story and breaking news. Some no doubt also come
to enjoy the reﬂected glory of associating with the famous
and the powerful. Indeed, many journalists have become
celebrities themselves. Not coincidentally, this has beneﬁts for
their employers—nothing sells like celebrity.
But only a brave, naïve, or foolhardy journalist would
publicly admit these days to believing that one of their roles is
to help provide a voice for those who otherwise have difﬁculty
having their voices heard, such as the disadvantaged. It is
not a career-enhancing move at a time when many media

proprietors have decided that a key to improving proﬁts lies
with their so-called AB audiences.
For those not up-to-date with marketing jargon, AB is
shorthand for the afﬂuent professionals so beloved by cashed-
up advertisers. The theory goes that media outlets that attract
audiences at the AB end of the socioeconomic scale are
more likely to win advertisers or, even better, to get away with
charging them premium rates. A senior manager at one of
Australia’s major newspaper groups recently explained why
his company is focusing on boosting AB readership rather
than total circulation [22]. “A good circulation result is one
which attracts the readership we need and advertisers want,”
said Mark Scott, Editor-in-Chief of Fairfax’s metropolitan
newspapers, which include the respected broadsheet, The
Sydney Morning Herald.
“Sure, The Daily Telegraph [a tabloid] sells many more copies
than The Sydney Morning Herald,” said Scott, “but their ad
rates are lower because the SMH [Sydney Morning Herald] has
that AB audience.” Scott said Fairfax’s Sunday title The Sun-
Herald is signiﬁcantly more proﬁtable at its present circulation
level of about 513,000 than it was when it was selling 600,000
copies. “We have held that AB audience so our advertising
revenue is up and our costs are lower.”
So what has this to do with how the media report health?
Scott explained that his newspapers do extensive market
research so they know what the AB market wants to read and
how they want it presented. “We create our papers with those
readers in mind and shape our marketing and promotions
to reinforce their values and interests.” In other words,
the allocation of scarce resources in ever more stretched
newsrooms is driven by what market researchers tell media
managers about what AB audiences want to know about.
This has implications for how the media cover all the
areas that affect peoples’ health—politics, economics, and
education, for example—as well as the coverage of health
issues themselves. I haven’t seen the market research, but
it’s not hard to guess what interests AB groups. They might
want to know how to stay as healthy, smart, and good-looking
as possible for as long as possible. They might want to know
which biotech companies are good investments, and might
be particularly interested in private health care. They are
probably less interested in the needs of indigenous people,
prisoners, the homeless, asylum seekers, or the poor, and it’s
probably a fair bet to say that they are also less interested in
the ways in which disadvantaged groups have worse access to
health care and prevention efforts.
Some might think this is overly cynical. Perhaps AB people
are not all self-centred; perhaps they care about broader issues
than those that directly affect their own lives and personal
well-being. Nor can the compliance of journalists be assumed.
In the chaotic and anarchic world of journalism, there are
many who try to do far more with their jobs than to make their
bosses wealthy—even if they have to try and “sell” their stories
to their news managers on the grounds that the stories will
be of interest to the ABs. Many other factors also shape and
inﬂuence news production. And a truly compelling story is
likely to get a run, even if not of direct relevance to the wealthy.
Nonetheless, it is important to remember the commercial
imperative when examining media coverage of health.
Many initiatives aimed at inﬂuencing health coverage target
journalists, who are only one component of the media
industry. Other powerful forces also shape how health is
covered. An analogy can be drawn with efforts to improve the
quality and safety of health care, another chaotic industry.
Measures aimed at individual clinicians may be helpful in
reducing medical errors, but it is also important to look at the
broader system in which clinicians work.
Katherine A.Baverstock:The Media Can Play
a Special Role in Providing a Voice for People
to Express Their Experiences of Illness
A registered pharmacist for the last 15 years, I was trained
in the biomedical model of health, to measure and note
signs and symptoms, make assessments, and advise about
treatments on the basis of available scientiﬁc evidence.
Becoming interested in the portrayal of medicines in the
media whilst working in outback Australia (which is grossly
underserved by health professionals), I began my doctoral
project within this quantitative biomedical tradition. As I
found during my literature review, research arising from this
tradition assesses media writing about medicines for “quality.”
Such research focuses on certain categories of quantitative
information about the medicine, such as the indication,
associated risks and beneﬁts, outcomes of treatment,
contraindications, and cost, that would allow readers to
analyse the evidence for themselves and decide whether they
should use the medicine.
The research in this area seems to be advocating a position
for the health journalist as an educator. Australia’s Quality
Use of Medicines Strategy [23] has the objective of optimising
the use of medicines within the Australian community. It
lists the media as a partner in the strategy, together with
consumers, health professionals, government, and the
pharmaceutical industry. Similar to the other partners, the
media have special responsibilities to ensure the quality use
of medicines, as described in Box 2. Although many of these
responsibilities sit comfortably within the codes of ethics
Box 2.Australia’s National Strategy for Quality
Use of Medicines: Responsibilities of the Media
The media are responsible for the following.
• Ethical and responsible reporting on health-care issues
• Reporting on medicines accurately and attempting to have
errors corrected if they occur
• Being aware of the variety of available information sources on
medicines and the limitations of each source
• Being aware of the impact of media reports on the use of
medicines in the community
• Being aware of issues relevant to the broad context of medicine
use,including risks of medicine use,non-drug alternatives,and
the cost of medicine use to individuals and society
• Encouraging dissemination of messages that enhance the
quality of medication use

industry is to make proﬁt.

observed by working journalists, some of these responsibilities
made me uncomfortable as a health professional. Should
journalists be viewed as de facto health educators with the
same responsibilities as those of us in the registered health
professions?
As I progressed in this quantitative framework, I began
to feel more and more uncomfortable with the narrow
examination of the newspaper stories I had collected for
my research. As my analysis continued, it became apparent
that the newspaper stories contained themes far richer and
more interesting than quantitative information about how
drugs work. The stories were an intriguing insight into how
the community viewed issues surrounding medicines and the
use of medicines. Even more interesting were the narratives
about experiences with medicines. I decided to transfer my
research to a communications faculty, and explored a far
different perspective of medicines in the media. One of my
ﬁrst realisations was that the media are much more than the
newspapers, television, and radio focussed on by so many
biomedical researchers. They also include new media (the
Internet), other print media, and small-scale media, such as
leaﬂets and posters, and even the messages on the pens given
out by pharmaceutical representatives.
I would like to propose that rather than act as educators,
the media can play a special role in providing a voice for
people to express their experiences of illness and their
interactions with the technologies of health. The advent
of the Internet has democratised the media because this
medium is accessible to everyone. The Internet can cross
national boundaries and counteract isolation—not only
geographic isolation, but also the isolation that may be caused
by the experience of chronic illness and not knowing anyone
who has lived your experience. People who were unable
to have their stories heard within the traditional medical
consultation now have a forum where they can be heard and
have their stories validated.
There is much research published within the sociological
and anthropological literature examining the narrative
surrounding health and illness within various types of media.
Research now needs to examine how patients use information
they ﬁnd within the media, and whether it does make a
difference to the medical encounter. Will an informed and
questioning client leave us feeling threatened?
Within the traditional health setting, lengthy
communication between medical professionals and clients
is often not possible. Many health professionals receive
scant training in communication and counselling. The use
of media technologies allows our clients to tell their story,
a biography that may be ever-changing because of the
experience of chronic illness. I would argue, that rather than
being much maligned by health professionals, the media
should be viewed as a tool that allows healing by facilitating
the telling of stories.
