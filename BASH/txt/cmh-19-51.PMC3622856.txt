INTRODUCTION
Although vaccination for the prevention of hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection has been effectively used for over 25 years, HBV
infection is still one of the most important and fatal infectious
liver diseases, with approximately 400 million chronically infected
people worldwide.1
The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in
developed countries such as Western Europe and the USA is cur-
rently less than 1-2%, however in Asia, Africa, and some Mediter-
ranean countries, the prevalence exceeds as high as 10%. Above
all, in these high prevalence areas, past or remote HBV infection
as well as overt HBV infection may cause serious health problems.
A study of hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with
rituximab therapy in real-world clinical practice: a sin-
gle-center experience

Background/Aims: The widespread use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and immunosuppressants has resulted in
reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) recently becoming an issue. Although rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal
antibody) has revolutionized the treatment of lymphoma, recent reports have suggested that rituximab therapy
increases the risk of viral-mediated complications, and particularly HBV reactivation. This study analyzed real clinical
practice data for rituximab-related HBV reactivation.
Methods: Between January 2005 and December 2011, 169 patients received treatment with rituximab. Screening status
of the HBV infection and frequency of preemptive therapy were determined in these patients, and the clinical features of
HBV reactivation were analyzed.
Results: Seventy-nine of the 169 patients with chronic or past HBV infection were selected for evaluation of HBV
reactivation. Of the 90 patients who were excluded, 22 (13.0%) were not assessed for HBsAg and anti-HBc, and 14 (8.3%)
were not assessed for anti-HBc due to seronegativity for HBsAg. The selected patients were divided into those with
chronic HBV infection (n=12) and those with past HBV infection (n=67); six patients (7.6%) experienced HBV reactivation.
Eight patients received preemptive therapy, but three patients (37.5%) underwent HBV reactivation. Although HBsAg
seropositivity was an independent risk factor for HBV reactivation (P=0.038), of the six patients with HBV reactivation,
two (33.3%) had past HBV infection and three (50%) died of liver failure.
Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that adherence to guidelines for screening and preemptive therapy
for HBV reactivation was negligent among the included cohort. Attention should be paid to HBV reactivation in patients
with past as well as chronic HBV infection during and after rituximab therapy. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2013;19:51-59)

Recently, with wide-spread use of cytotoxic chemotherapy or
immunosuppressants such as high-dose corticosteroids and bio-
logic agents, reactivation of HBV is becoming an issue. Because
the goal of newly invented drugs is mostly to control human
immune system, this issue becomes more important. In particu-
lar, rituximab is a human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody
directed against the CD20 antigen expressed on the surface of
normal and malignant B lymphocytes. It was approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006, primarily for the
treatment of B-cell malignancies such as non-Hodgkin’s lympho-
mas.2
Since then, its use has expanded to the treatment of many
other diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosis, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, Sjögren’s syndrome, multiple sclerosis, graft vs.
host disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and dermatomyositis.3
Several reports have suggested that rituximab therapy may
increase the risk of viral-mediated complications, particularly HBV
reactivation. HBV reactivation associated with rituximab therapy
is usually subclinical, however, frequently it can result in the de-
velopment of severe complications, including acute liver failure
and death. In October 2004, the U.S. FDA reported that the use
of rituximab might be associated with episodes of fulminant hepa-
titis.4
In endemic areas such as Korea, Taiwan and China, there
are many patients with current or past HBV infection. Therefore,
reactivation of HBV induced by rituximab therapy can be a seri-
ous clinical problem in these areas. The aim of this study was to
inquire the actual condition of preparation for HBV reactivation
prior to rituximab therapy in clinical practice, and to investigate
clinical features and risk factors for HBV reactivation during or af-
ter rituximab-based therapy at a single tertiary institute in an area
with a high prevalence of HBV infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From January 2005 to December 2011, a total of 169 patients
received treatment with rituximab at Yeungnam University hos-
pital. The subjects for this study were selected regardless of
treatment departments. All medical records were retrospectively
reviewed. Of 169 patients, 79 patients with chronic HBV infec-
tion or past HBV infection were selected for evaluation of HBV
reactivation in this study. The demographic characteristics of the
patients, the incidence of HBV reactivation and its risk factors in
association with rituximab therapy were analyzed. Assessments of
the frequency and results for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg),
antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe), antibodies to hepatitis B core
(anti-HBc), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, total
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
prothrombin time (PT), white blood cell, hemoglobin, platelet and
HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed for all
patients before or during rituximab therapy. The HBV DNA load
was measured by quantitative real-time PCR assay (Cobas Taq-
man HBV-DNA Test, Roche Diagnostics Systems, CA, USA) with a
minimal sensitivity of 20 IU/mL. Measurement of HBsAg, anti-HBs,
anti-HBc, HBeAg, and anti-HBe was performed using commercially
available enzyme immunoassays (Architect i2000SR, Abbott Diag-
nostics, IL, USA). We calculated the total dose and the mean dose
per cycle of rituximab. This study was conducted in accordance
with the Helsinki Declaration. The medical ethical committee of
our medical center approved the study protocol.
Definition
HBV reactivation and hepatitis were defined as follows. HBV
reactivation was defined as reappearance or an increase in serum
HBV DNA over 10 folds (1 log10 IU/mL), compared with the pre-
treatment level. Hepatitis was defined as a threefold or greater
increase in serum ALT level that exceeded 120 IU/L (reference
range, <40 IU/L). Chronic HBV infection was defined as HBsAg se-
ropositivity over a period of six months, irrespective of HBeAg and
HBV DNA seropositivity, including chronic inactive carriers. Past
or resolved HBV infection was defined as HBsAg and HBV DNA
seronegative, anti-HBc seropositive, and/or anti-HBs seropositive.
Liver cirrhosis was defined by histologic, clinical or radiological ev-
idence. Clinical signs of liver cirrhosis included lower platelet count
(<1.4×105
cell/μL), the existence of varix, or the development of
ascites. Patients with fever or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leu-
kopenia, tachypnea, or tachycardia, with a proven or suspected
infectious condition, were regarded as having sepsis. Preemptive
antiviral therapy was defined as the administration of an antiviral
agent prior to the start of rituximab therapy.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were presented as the mean value ± stan-
dard deviation (range). The independent-samples t test was used
if parametric assumptions were met for numerical data. Mann-
Whitney U test was used when parametric assumptions were not
met. For categorical measures, Pearson χ2
or Fisher’s exact tests

were used for non-continuous variables. Univariate analysis was
performed on significant variables. The binary logistic regression
model was used to identify independent risk factors. A P-value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PASW sta-
tistics version 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA)
and Microsoft Excel 2007 (Microsoft corp., Redmond, Washing-
ton, USA) were used for analysis of all data.
RESULTS
The patients who received rituximab therapy included 101 men
and 68 women, with the mean (±standard deviation) age of 61.8
(±18.1 years). The baseline characteristics of all patients received
rituximab therapy are shown in Table 1. Rituximab was adminis-
tered to patients in the department of hemato-oncology (156/169,
92.3%), neurology (6/169, 3.6%), pediatrics (5/169, 3.0%), gen-
eral surgery (1/169, 0.6%) and nephrology (1/169, 0.6%) (Table
2). In the department of hemato-oncology, the serologic test for
current HBV infection or HBsAg prior to rituximab therapy was not
performed in even 16 patients (10.3%). The rate of assessment for
serology of HBsAg in department of neurology and pediatrics was
50% (3/6) and 60% (3/5), respectively. Rituximab was used in
the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (139/169, 82.2%)
and other lymphomas (18/169, 10.7%). The remaining 12 cases
included acute graft rejection, neuromyelitis optica, multiple scle-
rosis, graft vs. host disease, immune thrombocytopenic purpura,
and aplastic anemia. Hepatitis developed after rituximab therapy
in thirty five patients (35/169, 20.7%). The most common cause of
hepatitis was unknown etiology (57.1%). The remaining causes in-
cluded sepsis (22.9%), HBV reactivation (17.1%), hepatitis A virus
(2.9%) and so on.
Of 169 patients, ninety patients were excluded from this study
based on HBV serology results; 54 patients didn’t have a history of
HBV infection; 22 patients (13.0%) were not assessed for HBsAg
and anti-HBc; 14 patients (8.3%) were not assessed for anti-HBc
due to seronegativity for HBsAg (Fig. 1). The rest of 79 patients
were divided into two groups, a group with chronic HBV infection
(n=12) and a group with past HBV infection (n=67). Baseline char-
acteristics and clinical features of 79 patients with HBV infection
are shown in Table 3. None of the patients had co-infection with
both HBV and HCV. Of 79 patients, six patients were confirmed
to have developed HBV reactivation by the definition mentioned
above (6/79, 7.6%). There were two patients with past HBV infec-
tion in a total of six patients with HBV reactivation (2/6, 33.3%).
All six patients with HBV reactivation had undergone treatment
for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. These six patients received in-

travenous rituximab therapy along with cyclophosphamide, doxo-
rubicin, vincristine and prednisolone as an R-CHOP regimen.
Based on the definition of HBV reactivation, the subjects were
divided into two groups: a patient group (n=6) with HBV reac-
tivation and a patient group (n=73) without HBV reactivation.
Assessments of baseline characteristics, seropositive viral markers
of HBV infection, and baseline liver function for both groups were
performed. There was a significant difference in the seropositivity
for HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA between two groups (P<0.05).
There were also statistical difference in age, the total dose of
rituximab, the total number of therapy cycles, baseline hemoglo-
bin level and albumin level between two groups (P<0.05). The
major comparative analyses of both groups are shown in Table
4. The mean interval from the initial administration of rituximab
to HBV reactivation was approximately 47.0±19.3 (24-70) weeks,
and the mean interval from the last administration of rituximab in
a cycle to HBV reactivation was approximately 24.3±20.6 (0-46)
weeks. The mean durations of rituximab administration of each
group were not significantly different one another (22.3 weeks vs.
18.8 weeks; P=0.102). Of six patients with HBV reactivation, five
patients (5/6, 83.3%) were treated with antiviral rescue therapy
and the remaining patient did not receive specific treatment.
Among those six patients, three patients (3/6, 50.0%) died of he-
patic failure, and the other three patients survived (Table 5).
Among 79 patients with HBsAg seropositive status or anti-HBc
seropositive status, preemptive antiviral therapy was adminis-
tered to only eight patients (8/79, 10.1%). All these eight patients
were HBsAg seropositive. Lamivudine was administered to seven
patients (87.5%) and clevudine was administered to one patient
(12.5%) for preemptive therapy. The mean duration of preemp-
tive therapy was 38.0±22.8 weeks. However, three of them (3/8,
37.5%) experienced HBV reactivation. The mean duration of pre-
emptive therapy of these patients with reactivation was 55.0±15.5
weeks. All these three patients received preemptive treatment

with lamivudine and experienced HBV reactivation under preemp-
tive therapy.
For detection of risk factors for rituximab-related HBV reactiva-
tion, univariate analyses were performed on factors associated
with occurrence of HBV reactivation. Univariate analyses revealed
that seropositivity for HBsAg and HBeAg were statistically sig-
nificant (P=0.019, and P=0.008) but seropositivity for HBV DNA,
patient’s age, the total dose of rituximab, the total cycles of ritux-
imab therapy, baseline hemoglobin level and albumin level were
not statistically significant (P>0.05) (Table 6). A binary logistic
regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk
factors for HBV reactivation. The result revealed that seropositivity
for HBsAg (OR, 9.286; 95% CI, 1.127-76.541, P=0.038) was the
only independent risk factor for HBV reactivation (Table 7).
DISCUSSION
Though many guidelines established in the Europe, US, and
Asia-Pacific including Korea have already warned risk of HBV re-
activation, and recommended preemptive therapy associated with
immunosuppressants therapy, in particular rituximab, there is still
a lack of awareness among clinicians regarding cytotoxic agents
and immunosuppressant-induced HBV reactivation. Even in tertia-
ry care institutions, the assessment of hepatitis B serologies prior
to the administration of rituximab-based therapy is infrequently
conducted and the frequency of preemptive therapy and HBV re-
activation rates are unclear. In our study, it was found that assess-
ments of viral markers for chronic HBV infection or assessment of
past HBV infection were not performed in 22 patients (13%). Even
hemato-oncologists failed to perform the baseline assessment of
viral markers for overt hepatitis B virus infection (HBsAg) in 16
patients (16/156, 10.3%). Neurologists administered rituximab to
six patients to treat neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis. Of

these six patients, three patients (3/6, 50%) were not assessed
for viral markers of HBV infection and none of the patients were
assessed for liver function. Despite the use of a lower dosage of
rituximab in department of pediatrics, pediatricians also neither
check the viral markers (2/5, 40%) nor perform liver function test.
In our study, rituximab was mostly administered to patients with
hematologic diseases or lymphoma. Thus, complete blood cell
counts including hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase level
were selected for analysis to investigate association between im-
munologic status or disease progression and HBV reactivation.
Unexpectedly, baseline hemoglobin levels of patients with HBV
reactivation were higher than those of patients without HBV re-
activation (14.0 vs. 12.1 g/dL). Among analyzed parameters, only
baseline hemoglobin level differed statistically, but there was no
relation between baseline hemoglobin level and HBV reactivation
at univariate analysis.
It has been reported that both patients with past HBV infection
and patients with chronic HBV infection are at high risk of HBV re-
activation.5
Lee et al reported that one third of the world’s popula-
tion has serologic evidence of previous hepatitis B infection (hepa-
titis B core antibodies).6
A recent report suggested that at least
one-half of the population has prior exposure to HBV infection in
endemic area such as Hong Kong.7
East Asian countries including
Korea, Taiwan and China, are areas of high prevalence. Therefore,
the incidence of past HBV infection is estimated to be between
one third and one-half of the world population. In this study, there
were two patients with past HBV infection in a total of six patients
with HBV reactivation (33.3%). It was thought that Patient No. 3
and No. 5 (shown in Table 5) were ones with past HBV infection
prior to the therapy and underwent the seroreversion, the change
from HBsAg seronegative status to seropositive status due to HBV
reactivation. However, there is no agreed guideline regarding pre-
emptive antiviral therapy for patients with past HBV infection. The
most recent European and US guidelines recommend close moni-
toring of HBV DNA during rituximab therapy and initiation of anti-
viral therapy if HBV DNA is positive or at low level,8,9
which implies
the existence and importance of HBV carrier with a low HBV DNA
level. In this study, all baseline HBV DNA levels of patients experi-
enced HBV reactivation with a history of past HBV infection were
not detected. The reason may be related to the system used for
HBV DNA detection in this study was able to detect only a value
of HBV DNA over 20 IU/mL correctly. Therefore, special attention
should be paid to the detection of an HBV DNA carrier with lower
HBV DNA level.
The HBV reactivation rate in patients with chronic or past HBV
infection was 7.6% (6/79) in our study. The reported HBV reacti-
vation rates of patients with inactive carriers or patients with past
HBV infection who underwent immunosuppressive chemotherapy
in other studies widely ranged from 16.3 to 55%.10-13
The reason
for the lower incidence of HBV reactivation in this study may be
explained by unknown origin hepatitis and hepatic failure. Among
20 patients with unknown origin of hepatitis, eight patients were
HBsAg or anti-HBc seropositive (40%). Despite these eight pa-
tients had the elevated liver enzymes, seropositivity for HBV DNA
was not evaluated for them. Of those eight patients, two patients
died of fulminant hepatitis and hepatic failure with ALT values
greater than 2,000 IU/mL. Despite of the absence of data on HBV
DNA, it was possible to infer the occurrence of HBV reactivation.
There was a 69-year-old male patient who was found to be HBsAg
seronegative and was subsequently excluded from anti-HBc serol-
ogy. His ALT and total bilirubin were elevated to 49 IU/L and 3.64
mg/dL after 2.5 years of withdrawal of rituximab therapy and HBV
serology tests were subsequently performed. The results showed
seropositivity for HBsAg and anti-HBc and HBV DNA was greater
than 107
IU/ml. It was estimated that the patient underwent HBV
reactivation due to rituximab therapy resulting in the serorever-
sion of HBsAg. This patient was excluded from our study because
serology of anti-HBc had not been checked. If all these cases had
been considered, HBV reactivation rate of this study would have
been noted between 11.3 and 18.8%.
In the present study, the mean intervals from the last adminis-
tration of rituximab to the occurrence of hepatitis and the reac-
tivation of HBV were 20 weeks, and 24 weeks, respectively. In
some studies, it has been suggested that HBV DNA titers begin to
rise before 2-3 weeks of elevation of liver enzymes and decrease
down to an undetectable level.4,10
It is thought that the difference
in the reported duration of this change is owing to infrequent
assessment of HBV DNA levels. In general, clinicians failed to
routinely assess HBV DNA levels for patients with chronic or past
HBV infection. They only tested HBV DNA levels for the differential
diagnosis of hepatitis.
In our study, of eight patients who received preemptive therapy,
three patients experienced reactivation of HBV. The reactivation
of HBV was occurred in the course of preemptive therapy as la-
mivudine. The mean duration of preemptive therapy of patients
with reactivation was 55 weeks. Long-term preemptive therapy
might have an influence on emergence of lamivudine-resistant
mutation. Thus, we had no choice but to doubt association be-
tween development of HBV reactivation and lamivudine-resistant
mutation. However, unfortunately, there were no patients who

had undergone assessment for lamivudine resistance. The op-
timal duration of preemptive treatment for patients with HBV
reactivation remains uncertain. The general recommendation is
that preemptive therapy should be continued for a period of at
least 3 months (range, 3-6 months) after the withdrawal of im-
munosuppresants.8,9,14
However, the authors propose that the
preemptive therapy should be at least 12 months or longer after
the withdrawal of rituximab therapy because HBV reactivation oc-
curs between 0-46 weeks after the cessation of rituximab therapy
(the mean duration: 24 weeks). This proposal is corresponding to
recommendations in other studies. A longer period of preemptive
therapy (>12 months) has been also suggested in some previous
studies because patients receiving monoclonal antibodies such
as rituximab or alemtuzumab make a slow recovery until their im-
munity is reinforced.4,15,16
Considering the possibility of emergence
of lamivudine-resistance and necessity of long-term preemptive
therapy during or after rituximab therapy, new antiviral agent such
as entecavir and tenofovir will be able to become an alternative.
In the present study, of six patients with HBV reactivation, three
patients (50.0%) died of hepatic decompensation resulting from
HBV reactivation. Above all, patient No. 6 (shown in Table 5) re-
ceived preemptive therapy as lamivudine, and rescue therapy with
combination of lamivudine and adefovir. The patient was diag-
nosed as a hepatitis B carrier 10 years ago, and regularly checked
for HBV serology and liver function without specific antiviral
therapy. However, the patient died of hepatic failure by rituximab-
induced HBV reactivation, pneumonia and renal failure at the time
of admission 109 days. The mortality rate of cancer patients with
viral reactivation is reported to vary from 3.7 to 71.4%.17-20
In gen-
eral, the mortality rate is higher than overall liver-related mortal-
ity.21
In addition, most cases of rituximab-related HBV reactivation
found in literature are severe or fatal cases.22-24
Hui et al inves-
tigated the association between intrahepatic covalently closed
circular DNA (cccDNA) and HBV reactivation after chemotherapy.25
Levels of intrahepatic viral cccDNA of patients with HBV reactiva-
tion was significantly higher than those of patients without HBV
reactivation. Severity of hepatocyte destruction was related to
the viral load in liver, and intrahepatic cccDNA was identified as a
key inducer increasing viral load. Thus, it was estimated that the
increase of intrahepatic viral cccDNA in patients with HBV DNA
reactivation might have a strong influence on more severe hepatic
failure.
In this study, rituximab was administered along with cortico-
steroids to all subjects. Both corticosteroids and rituximab affect
viral replication and the anti-HBV immune response of a host.26
Among immnosuppressants, corticosteroids have the unique
ability to directly enhance HBV replication by binding to specific
receptors in the viral genome (Glucocorticoid Responsive Element,
GRE). Suzuki et al reported about the impact of mutations in the
GRE region of HBV DNA on the response of glucocorticoid and a
relationship between viral replication and mutations in the GRE
region.27
Yeo et al reported that a high dose of corticosteroids in
chemotherapeutic regimens was associated with an increased risk
for HBV reactivation.4
Hence, further studies regarding the risk of
HBV reactivation during or after rituximab single therapy and the
combined therapy of rituximab and corticosteroids will be required
in the future.
There are two limitations which need to be acknowledged and
addressed regarding this study. The first limitation is that twenty
patients (20/169, 11.8%) received only single rituximab therapy.
Of these 20 patients, 10 patients (50%) had a history of chronic
or past HBV infection but none of the patients experienced either
HBV reactivation or hepatitis. The mean dose of rituximab used in
those 20 patients was no more than 560.6±72.1 mg. The other
limitation is the inability to determine the true number of patients
who were actually positive for HBsAg due to the existence of un-
screened patients resulting in the failure to establish a true reacti-
vation rate. Although the HBV reactivation rate of this study might
have been underestimated, the identification of six HBV reactiva-
tion cases including three deaths is significant.
In conclusion, the results of this study have demonstrated the
lack of compliance with guidelines on HBV screening and preemp-
tive therapy for patients undergoing rituximab-based therapy. Ef-
forts should be made to screen all patients undergoing rituximab
therapy for HBV infection and to administer preemptive antiviral
therapy to patients with HBsAg seropositivity. In patients with
past HBV infection (anti-HBc, seropositive), regular assessments of
HBV serology, HBV DNA level, and liver biochemical tests are es-
sential and should be performed during or after rituximab therapy.
Also, trials to detect low level HBV DNA carriers are required. It
is suggested that administration of preemptive antiviral therapy
should be conducted at least for a period of 12 months after the
cessation of rituximab. Further well-designed studies on risk fac-
tors for HBV reactivation induced by rituximab will be required in
the future.
