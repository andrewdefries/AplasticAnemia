In man, gene products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are involved
in the T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity directed to minor histoeompatibility antigens. In
a previous publication, we demonstrated that self HLA antigens were required to
obtain cell-mediated cytotoxicity directed to the male-associated antigen, H-Y. (1, 2).
Analogous restriction phenomena in man have also been shown for virus-infected
target cells and for DNCB-modified target cells (3, 4).
To explain the restriction phenomenon, two hypotheses have been put forward (5).
According to one hypothesis (altered self) the antigens recognized can be regarded as
neoantigens created by molecular interactions between self compatible HLA-A, -B, or
-C gene product and the foreign antigen. This altered self concept is a logical
consequence of classical theories of immunology such as the clonal selection theory
(6, 7), and this interpretation is favored by some investigators (8, 9). According to
another hypothesis (dual recognition) the antigens are seen by cells which have two
receptors; one recognizes self compatible HLA-A, -B, or -C, and the other recognizes
the foreign antigen. This concept is supported by other authors (10-13) but at the
present moment a firm choice cannot be made between these two hypotheses.
Whichever is true, two aspects of the specificity of T-cell recognition in cell-mediated
lympholysis (CML) are important to evaluate. First, is the anti-self or altered-self
reaction clonal implying the existence of multiple populations of specific immune cells
(14, 15)? Second, is the anti-self or altered-self reaction attributable to lymphocytes
with polyvalent speeificities as suggested by others (16)? The discovery of a case of
HLA-restricted CML reactivity directed to the H-Y antigen in which the killing was
restricted by a requirement either for self HLA-A2 or B7, and the development of a
monolayer absorption technique by one of us (15), gave us the opportunity to answer
these questions.
Materials and Methods
Lymphocytes of two female patients (patients A and B) were used. The HLA-restricted H-Y
killing phenomenon as described in previous studies was demonstrated in both (2, 17). In
reference 17, patient 1 is equivalent to patient A and patient B is the individual referred to as
the third patient. Patients A and B were both suffering from aplastic anemia and had received
multiple transfusions, a situation which severely limited our access to materials. Lymphocytes
from A and B were cultured for 6 d with lymphoeytes from HLA-A, -B, and -C identical, but

HLA-D different male individuals. After this in vitro sensitization, specific anti-HLA-A2-H-Y
cytotoxic cells were generated in the case of patient A (17). Patient B formed cytotoxic cells
which specifically recognized HLA-A2 male target cells and HLA-B7 male target cells (Table
II). We demonstrated, that the effector cells of the patients studied retained their specificities
for HLA-A2 males for a long period of time and that by recalling immunological memory
(using lymphocytes from HLA-D different unrelated male donors) it was possible to reinduce
high levels of specific killing (17). After culturing, the sensitized effector cells were overlaid on
monolayers, according to the techniques described elsewhere (15), which were based on the
mouse system introduced by Brondz et al. (16). The nonadherent cells were removed and tested
on a panel of target cells, which had been incubated with phytohemagglutinin for 3 d and then
labeled with sodium Slchromate. Cytotoxicity as exemplified in Tables I and III, was measured
and calculated as a percentage according to the methods described elsewhere (17).
Preparation of the Monolayer. Monolayers were made of fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes
adhered to Petri dishes treated with poly-L-lysine; the nonadherent cells were removed after 1
h at room temperature. The effector cells were overlaid and incubated for 1 h at 37°C and
nonadherent cells were removed and tested (reference 15). The calculation of the depletion of
cytotoxicity, referred to in the text, was calculated as a percentage ofthe unabsorbed population.
Results
After 6 d of in vitrOsensitization, the responder cells of patient A reacted specifically
against HLA-A2 males, as illustrated in Table I and in reference 1. These were
absorbed on four different monolayers, which were numbered one to four and were,
respectively, HLA-A2 male, non-HLA-A2 male, HLA-A2 female, non-HLA-A2 fe-
male. The nonadherent cells were removed and tested on a panel of unrelated target
cells, in which the same specificities were represented.
Effector cells absorbed on monolayer 1 (HLA-A2 male) gave strongly reduced
cytotoxic activity directed to all HLA-A2 male-positive target cells. The depletion
varied from 47 to 64%. Absorption on monolayer 2 (non-HLA-A2 male), 3 (HLA-A2
female), and 4 (non-HLA-A2 female) showed no significant reduction in cytolysis
(Table I). These results illustrated that only the appropriate monolayer, i.e. an HLA-
A2 male monolayer, could absorb the specific killer cells.
Patient B lymphocytes showed cytotoxic activity against two independent pheno-
types namely, HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 male target cells (Table II). Using these cells,
we investigated whether it was possible to specifically absorb one clone of cytotoxic
cells and leave the other intact, thus demonstrating the clonal expression of these
specific killer cells. Table III showed that when effector cells recovered from monolayer
1 (HLA-A2 male) were tested on the panel of target cells, almost complete removal of
the cytotoxic activity could be demonstrated against male HLA-A2 target cells (target
5-8). The converse effect was found after absorption with monolayer 3 (HLA-B7
male) and, in this case, the reaction directed to HLA-B7 males was specifically
depleted. Double absorption further depleted the killer cell clones, but because of the
limited amount of material available, it was not possible to perform this in all cases
(E. Goulmy, unpublished results). The most effective reduction (up to 82%) in
cytotoxicity was obtained with monolayer 4 (HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 male). Killing
activity directed to the target cells which carried both restricting HLA antigens
(HLA-A2 and HLA-B7), was only partially reduced after absorption with an HLA-
A2 male monolayer (monolayer 1), or HLA-B7 male monolayer (monolayer 3). These
results provide strong evidence that the anti-B7 clone could be absorbed independently
of the anti-A2 clone.

Discussion
The reduction obtained in the level ofcytotoxicity in these experiments was thought
to be attributable to removal of specific subpopulations of effector cells by the
monolayer and not by admixed soluble antigen or cells detached from the monolayer.
Experiments in mouse using a similar system demonstrated that cells detached from
the monolayer were incapable of cold target inhibition (18). These observations were
confirmed in the human monolayer absorption techniques used here (15).
We cannot draw conclusions from these data which favor altered self or dual
recognition. In the former case, the clonal expression of killing would fulfill the
prediction of the clonal selection theory and altered self would simply be regarded as
an alloantigen. In the latter case, the clonal expression of anti-self would imply that
allelic exclusion existed with regard to anti-self HLA receptors, i.e. T-cell clones
specialize in different HLA-A, -B, and -C gene products of the self type and are thus
clonally expressed. Furthermore, the avidity of the two receptors (self and foreign)
would be interdependent.
Our findings are in agreement with those of others who observed that cytotoxic
effector cells directed to virus-infected syngeneic cells could be blocked in cold target
inhibition experiments only by the virus-infected syngeneic cells and not by virus-
infected allogeneic cells. Thus, self and foreign determinants are required on the same
cell to obtain blocking (19). This general rule is confirmed here and extended by our
experiments because they suggest that in man this anti-self or altered-self activity is
clonally expressed. The advantage of the absorption technique as used here is that
GOULMY ET AL. BRIEFDEFINITIVE REPORT 549
clones can be physically removed from cell suspensions, thus giving evidence for
separate populations. In contrast, cold target inhibition studies result only in blocking
of receptors and theoretically cannot distinguish between polyvalent and monovalent
effector cells. Of great interest was the observation that a small but significant
reduction in lysis of B7 positive cells occurred after absorption on A2 monolayers and
similarly, a reduction occurred in the killing of A2-positive cells after absorption on
B7 monolayers. There was no clear explanation of this phenomenon but the possibility
existed that it was attributable to clones of killer cells which recognized antigens that
were shared by both A2 and B7 bearing molecules (20, 21). No reduction at all has
been found using nonrelevant male or female monolayers.
The possible relevance of these findings to the mechanisms involved in the initiation
of autoimmune disease in man has been discussed elsewhere (22).
Summary
A monolayer absorption technique was used to test the hypothesis that killer cells
directed to self HLA-associated minor histocompatibility antigens (H-Y) were divisible
into subsets. The results showed that sensitized killer cells, which recognized two
combined antigens HLA-A2; H-Y and HLA-B7; H-Y could indeed be divided into
two populations. One was directed to HLA-A2; H-Y and the other to HLA-B7; H-Y.
These results can be interpreted in the context of the altered self hypothesis. However,
when interpreted in the context of the dual recognition hypothesis, they strongly
suggest that independant clones of killer T cells exist which are committed to the
recognition of self HLA.
