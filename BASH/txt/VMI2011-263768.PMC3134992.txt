Urinary tract disease is a common reason for use (and likely misuse, improper use, and overuse) of antimicrobials in dogs and
cats. There is a lack of comprehensive treatment guidelines such as those that are available for human medicine. Accordingly,
guidelines for diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections were created by a Working Group of the International Society
for Companion Animal Infectious Diseases. While objective data are currently limited, these guidelines provide information to
assist in the diagnosis and management of upper and lower urinary tract infections in dogs and cats.
1. Introduction
Urinary tract disease is commonly encountered in dogs and
cats and accounts for signiﬁcant use (and presumably also
overuse and misuse) of antimicrobials. Improper therapy
can lead to a variety of patient health (e.g., failure to
resolve infection), economic (e.g., need for repeated or
prolonged treatment), public health (e.g., antimicrobial
resistance) and regulatory (e.g., antimicrobial use) concerns.
In human medicine, antimicrobial use guidelines such
as those developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of
America (IDSA) are widely respected and provide excellent
guidance to physicians on management of various infectious
diseases, including urinary tract infections (UTIs) [1, 2].
Such guidelines can be directly used or form the basis of
hospital-level antimicrobial use guidelines. The impact of
national or international guidelines is diﬃcult to assess,
but implementation of antimicrobial use guidelines at the
2 Veterinary Medicine International
hospital level has been shown to signiﬁcantly improve
antimicrobial prescribing practices, either alone or as part of
a broader antimicrobial stewardship program [3–5].
This document contains guidelines developed in 2010
by the Antimicrobial Guidelines Working Group of the
International Society for Companion Animal Infectious
Diseases. During the course of guideline development, it
became abundantly clear that there are signiﬁcant limitations
in objective, published information. Accordingly, recom-
mendations are based on available data, whenever present,
along with expert opinion, considering principles of infec-
tious diseases, antimicrobial therapy, antimicrobial resis-
tance, pharmacology, and internal medicine. Correspond-
ing guidelines for human medicine were evaluated, with
careful consideration of the abundant diﬀerences between
species.
As with all guidelines, these should be interpreted as gen-
eral recommendations that are reasonable and appropriate
for the majority of cases. The Working Group acknowledges
the variability between cases, and these guidelines should not
be considered as standards of care that must be followed
in all circumstances. Rather, they should be considered the
basis of decision-making, with the potential that diﬀerent or
additional approaches may be required in a minority of cases.
Further, while these guidelines are designed as international
guidelines, appropriate for all jurisdictions, the Working
Group realizes that regional diﬀerences (e.g., antimicrobial
resistance rates, antimicrobial availability, prescribing regu-
lations) exist.
2. Simple Uncomplicated Urinary
Tract Infection
Simple uncomplicated UTI is a sporadic bacterial infection
of the bladder in an otherwise healthy individual with
normal urinary tract anatomy and function. The presence
of relevant comorbidities (e.g., diabetes mellitus, urinary or
reproductive tract conformational abnormalities) or 3 or
more episodes per year indicates complicated or recurrent
UTI, respectively, as are discussed below.
Clinically signiﬁcant infection implies the presence of
a clinical abnormality and is characterized by dysuria,
pollakiuria, and/or increased urgency of urination along with
the presence of bacteria in urine [2]. These clinical signs are
not pathognomonic for infection and can also be caused
by noninfectious conditions. Additionally, bacteria can be
present in the urine in the absence of clinical signs (covert
bacteriuria/subclinical bacteriuria). Therefore, the clinician
must interpret the clinical evaluation, gross and cytological
appearance of the urine, and bacterial culture results in
parallel to determine the likelihood of a clinically signiﬁcant
UTI.
2.1. Summary of Recommendations for Uncomplicated UTIs
2.1.1. Diagnosis of Uncomplicated UTIs. Proper and timely
diagnosis is critical for management of UTIs. Proper
diagnosis allows for determination of both the need for
antimicrobials and optimal drugs.
As discussed above, clinical signs are nonspeciﬁc and
should not be used alone for diagnosis of UTI. Rather, the
presence of clinical abnormalities should indicate the need
for further testing.
Sediment analysis alone is inadequate for diagnosis of
UTIs because of problems regarding the variable quality
of interpretation, stain contamination, and false positive
results from bacteriuria in the absence of clinical infection.
Hematuria and proteinuria are often present with a UTI, but
they are nonspeciﬁc and may be caused by noninfectious
conditions. The presence of pyuria and bacteriuria does,
however, provide supporting evidence of a UTI. Sediment
analysis is a useful adjunctive measure to consider in
conjunction with clinical signs and culture results. All
individuals performing analysis should be proﬁcient at the
technique, ideally through formal training and ongoing
education and quality control.
Complete urinalysis, including urine-speciﬁc gravity,
urine glucose level determination, and examination of the
sediment for crystalluria is considered a minimum database
for evaluation of suspected UTI and may be helpful to
investigate underlying causes of infection, if present.
Aerobic bacterial culture and susceptibility testing should
be performed in all cases, to conﬁrm the presence of
infection, identify the presence of resistant bacteria that
may not respond to initial therapy, to help diﬀerentiate
reinfection from relapse should a UTI return, and to provide
the clinician with guidance regarding the most common
bacteria causing UTI in their practice and local susceptibility
patterns.
Cystocentesis should be used for sample collection.
Catheterized samples can be evaluated for culture but
cystocentesis samples are preferred. Free-catch (midstream
voiding or manual expression) samples should not be used.
It is imperative that a quantitative culture be performed.
Urine samples for culture and susceptibility testing
should be refrigerated immediately after collection and
submitted to the laboratory as quickly as possible. Results
of samples that take 24 hours or more to reach the
laboratory should be interpreted with caution because of the
potential for both false positive and false negative results,
particularly if a urine preservative was not used. Testing of
refrigerated samples greater than 24 hours old is acceptable if
samples contain a urine preservative; otherwise, retesting is
recommended.
The use of speciﬁc urine transportation tubes is rec-
ommended, provided they are appropriate for the volume
of urine that is collected. The use of new or alternative
techniques or materials intended to facilitate successful
culture such as inoculation of “urine paddles” in clinics
is a reasonable alternative to traditional sample collection
approach to try to optimize bacterial recovery. The preferred
approach is for paddles to be inoculated in clinics and
promptly submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for incubation
and subsequent testing.
The use of traditional culture methods in clinics may be a
reasonable alternative to submission to outside laboratories.
In-clinic testing can minimize the impact of sample deteri-
oration that occurs between sample collection in the clinic
Veterinary Medicine International 3
and processing at the laboratory and can be cost-eﬀective
for screening purposes. However, bacterial isolation should
only be attempted in clinics with appropriate laboratory
facilities, proper equipment, proper biosafety level 2 (BSL-2)
containment and waste management, and adequately trained
individuals. Quantitative culture should be performed. Incu-
bation of urine paddles in the clinic can be performed,
but this approach has the same biosafety requirements as
incubation of culture plates.
Identiﬁcation and susceptibility testing must only be
performed if there is adequate biocontainment and properly
trained staﬀ. Only protocols that include reference strains
for quality control testing and have been standardized by
an appropriate organization (i.e., Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI), European Union Committee on
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), or equiva-
lent) should be followed.
If culture is being performed to screen samples and send
isolates (on plates, paddles, swabs, or any other approach)
to a diagnostic laboratory for subsequent testing, clinicians
must contact their laboratory to determine if those items
will be accepted. In all cases in which isolates are shipped,
regional regulations must be followed regarding shipment
of bacteria. If a veterinary clinic is unable to satisfy BSL-
2 containment and properly ship isolates, the use of these
techniques is discouraged.
The advantage of quantitative culture techniques lies in
the availability to determine the level of bacterial growth
(colony counts), which can be used in interpreting the
relevance of results. For samples collected by cystocentesis,
any level of bacterial growth may be signiﬁcant, although
samples from a UTI typically contain ≥103 colony forming
units (CFU)/mL [6]. The colony count and the identity of
the organism isolated should be considered in all situations.
Small numbers of minimally pathogenic skin commensals
(i.e., coagulase negative staphylococci) likely represent con-
tamination.
For samples collected via catheter, bacterial counts
≥104 CFU/mL in males and ≥105 in females are typically
considered signiﬁcant. Samples with lower counts should
be interpreted with caution and ideally repeated prior to
treatment to conﬁrm the same organism can be demon-
strated. Samples obtained in male dogs by catheterization
are usually adequate so long as proper sterile technique was
performed to obtain the sample. Positive cultures obtained
from catheterized female dogs should be conﬁrmed with a
cystocentesis unless medically contraindicated.
Although it has been suggested that bacterial counts
of greater than or equal to 105 CFU/mL in dogs and
104 CFU/mL in cats are signiﬁcant for free-catch samples
[6], the potential for high-level contamination is present and
therefore results from free-catch samples are not considered
diagnostic. Cystocentesis should be performed to conﬁrm
positive culture results from free-catch samples, unless
medically contraindicated.
Susceptibility testing should be performed according to
accepted standards, such as those published by the CLSI
or EUCAST, or another internationally recognized public
standard. The interpretive criteria for susceptibility testing
and breakpoints for systemic infections also apply to UTIs.
Those drugs for which urinary tract-speciﬁc breakpoints
have been provided are limited to ampicillin or amoxicillin
in dogs (≤8 µg/mL), amoxicillin-clavulanate in dogs and cats
<8/4 µg/mL), and nitrofurantoin.
2.1.2. Treatment of Uncomplicated UTIs. Antimicrobial ther-
apy is indicated in most cases while awaiting culture and
susceptibility results to relieve patient discomfort. In most
situations, initial therapy should consist of amoxicillin (11–
15 mg/kg PO q8h) or trimethoprim-sulfonamide (15 mg/kg
PO q12h) (Tables 1 and 2). Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
(12.5–25 mg/kg PO q8h) is an acceptable option but is
not recommended initially because of the lack of evidence
regarding the need for clavulanic acid and the desire to use
the narrowest spectrum that is possible while maintaining
optimal eﬃcacy.
Veterinarians should be aware of the pathogen and
antimicrobial resistance trends among urinary pathogens
isolated from patients in their clinic. Reports of resis-
tance rates from other institutions or broader surveillance
programs can provide some information but it is not a
replacement for clinic-level information.
Changes in local resistance patterns for urinary
pathogens should be monitored. As baseline resistance rates
of the most common organisms to a ﬁrst-line drug increase,
consideration should be given to changing the empirical
drug choice. Objective data regarding the prevalence of
resistance that indicates a need to change initial therapy is
lacking; however the Working Group considers 10% to be a
reasonable standard. Accordingly, if baseline resistance rates
to a given drug from non biased sample collection exceed
10%, the drug chosen for initial therapy should be changed
to another of the recommended initial choices. Care should
be taken when determining rates. Decisions should be based
on cultures from an appropriate patient population (i.e.,
animals presented for simple uncomplicated UTI). If culture
data are biased towards animals with refractory or recurrent
infections, then the baseline prevalence of resistance in the
uncomplicated UTI population could be overestimated.
Therefore, determination of this prevalence should involve a
comparable population of primary uncomplicated UTIs and
should involve the use of proper breakpoints.
If culture and susceptibility testing indicates the presence
of an isolate that is resistant in vitro to initial therapy
but there has been apparent clinical response, maintaining
the current treatment is acceptable provided a follow-up
urinalysis, including culture, is performed after treatment
has been completed to ensure resolution of infection.
If culture and susceptibility data indicate that the isolate
is not susceptible to the chosen antimicrobial and there is
a lack of clinical response, then therapy with the original
drug should be discontinued and treatment with an alter-
native drug begun. Factors that should be considered when
choosing the antimicrobial include the susceptibility of the
bacterium, potential adverse eﬀects, and issues regarding
prudent use of certain antimicrobials and antimicrobial
classes. More detailed discussion regarding drug selection is
provided below under Complicated UTI.
4 Veterinary Medicine International
Table 1: Summary of ﬁrst-line antimicrobial options for UTIs in the dog and cat.
Infection Type First-line drug options
Uncomplicated UTI Amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfonamide
Complicated Guided by culture and susceptibility testing, but consider amoxicillin or trimethoprim-sulfonamide initially
Subclinical bacteriuria
Antimicrobial therapy not recommended unless high risk for ascending infection. If so, treat as per
complicated UTI
Pyelonephritis Start with a ﬂuoroquinolone, with re-assessment based on culture and susceptibility testing
Adequate evidence regarding duration of treatment is
lacking, precluding the ability to make a speciﬁc recom-
mendation for treatment duration. Typically, uncomplicated
UTIs are treated for 7–14 days. However, the Working Group
acknowledges the likelihood that a shorter treatment time
(≤7 days) may be eﬀective. Accordingly, in the absence of
objective data, 7 days of appropriate antimicrobial treatment
is reasonable. Clinical trials supporting shorter durations for
treatment of UTIs in dogs and cats are strongly encouraged.
There is currently insuﬃcient evidence supporting the
use of other adjunctive treatment measures (e.g., cranberry
extract) for uncomplicated UTIs in animals.
2.1.3. Monitoring Response to Treatment of Uncomplicated
UTIs. There is no indication for measures beyond monitor-
ing of clinical signs. Provided the full course of antimicro-
bials is administered correctly, there is no evidence that intra-
or posttreatment urinalysis or urine culture is indicated in
the absence of ongoing clinical signs of UTI.
3. Complicated Urinary Tract Infection
A complicated UTI is an infection that occurs in the presence
of an anatomic or functional abnormality or a comorbidity
that predisposes the patient to persistent infection, recurrent
infection, or treatment failure [7]. In humans, the concurrent
presence of prostatitis, urinary calculi, a neurogenic blad-
der, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, or immunocompromising
disorders also deﬁnes a complicated UTI [7], and it is rea-
sonable to apply this to companion animals. An identiﬁable
abnormality is not always present, because of the diﬃculty
diagnosing some anatomical, functional, metabolic, or other
abnormalities. Recurrent UTIs, as deﬁned by the presence of
3 or more episodes of UTI during a 12-month period [8],
also indicate complicated infection.
Recurrent UTIs can more loosely be deﬁned as reinfec-
tion or relapse. While deﬁnitive determination of relapse
versus reinfection is diﬃcult (or often impossible), consid-
eration of whether reinfection or relapse is most likely is
important.
Reinfection is recurrence of a UTI within 6 months of
cessation of previous, apparently successful treatment and
isolation of a diﬀerent microorganism. If the same bacterial
species is present, genotyping is ideal to determine whether
the same strain is present; however this is uncommonly
available. Evaluation of antimicrobial susceptibility pattern
can be helpful, although unrelated organisms can have the
same susceptibility pattern and changes in susceptibility
can occur in individual strains. Therefore, evaluation of
susceptibility pattern is useful but not deﬁnitive.
Relapse is recurrence of a UTI within 6 months of
cessation of previous, apparently successful treatment and
isolation of an indistinguishable organism from the one
that was present previously, which is presumably because
of failure to completely eliminate the pathogen. In general,
relapses tend to occur earlier than reinfections (i.e., within
weeks rather than months) and are characterized by a period
of apparent bladder sterility during treatment. It should be
recognized that isolation of the same bacterial species, even
if the same antimicrobial susceptibility pattern is present,
does not deﬁnitively indicate that the organism was not
successfully eliminated, since reinfection with the same strain
or a phenotypically (or even genotypically) indistinguishable
strain cannot be ruled out.
A refractory infection is similar to a relapse except
that it is characterized by persistently positive results using
culture during treatment (despite in vitro susceptibility to the
antimicrobial), with no period of eliminated of bacteriuria
during or after treatment.
3.1. Summary of Recommendations for Complicated UTIs
3.1.1. Diagnosis of Complicated UTIs. General principles of
diagnosis, as discussed for simple uncomplicated UTI, apply
for complicated UTIs. A diagnosis of recurrent UTI should
never be based on clinical signs or urine sediment examina-
tion alone. Bacterial culture and susceptibility testing should
be performed in all instances to conﬁrm recurrent UTI.
Eﬀorts must be made to determine any underlying
factors that could be associated with recurrence or relapse.
A complete blood cell count, serum biochemical proﬁle,
urinalysis, imaging and, if deemed appropriate, endocrine
testing should be performed. A complete physical exami-
nation, including rectal palpation and examination of the
vulva, is required. Referral to a specialist in internal medicine
or surgery (particularly in females) should be considered
to further investigate underlying causes (e.g., cystoscopy).
If an underlying cause cannot be found and corrected, it is
possible therapy will ultimately be unsuccessful.
Client compliance with previous antimicrobial treatment
should be investigated. This is particularly important in cases
where relapse is suspected.
If cystotomy is being performed, culture of a bladder
wall biopsy as well as any uroliths that might be present is
recommended [9].

Table 2: Antimicrobial treatment options for urinary tract infections in the dog and cat.
Drug Dose Comments
Amoxicillin 11–15 mg/kg PO q8h
Good ﬁrst-line option for UTIs. Excreted in urine
predominantly in active form if normal renal function is
present. Ineﬀective against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
Amikacin
Dogs: 15–30 mg/kg IV/IM/SC q24h
Cats: 10–14 mg/kg IV/IM/SC q24h
Not recommended for routine use but may be useful for
treatment of multidrug resistant organisms. Potentially
nephrotoxic. Avoid in animals with renal insuﬃciency.
Amoxicillin/clavulanate
12.5–25 mg/kg PO q8h (dose based on
combination of amoxicillin +
clavulanate)
Not established whether there is any advantage over amoxicillin
alone.
Ampicillin
Not recommended because of poor oral bioavailability.
Amoxicillin is preferred.
Cephalexin, Cefadroxil 12–25 mg/kg PO q12h
Enterococci are resistant. Resistance may be common in
Enterobacteriaceae in some regions.
Cefovecin
8 mg/kg single SC injection. Can be
repeated once after 7–14 days.
Should only be used in situations where oral treatment is
problematic. Enterococci are resistant. Pharmacokinetic data
are available to support the use in dogs and cats, with a duration
of 14 days (dogs) and 21 days (cats). The long duration of
excretion in the urine makes it diﬃcult to interpret
posttreatment culture results.
Cefpodoxime proxetil 5 to 10 mg/kg q24h PO Enterococci are resistant.
Ceftiofur 2 mg/kg q12-24h SC
Approved for treatment of UTIs in dogs in some regions.
Enterococci are resistant.
Chloramphenicol
Dogs: 40–50 mg/kg PO q8h
Cats: 12.5–20 mg/kg PO q12h
Reserved for multidrug resistant infections with few other
options. Myelosuppression can occur, particularly with
long-term therapy. Avoid contact by humans because of rare
idiosyncratic aplastic anemia.
Ciproﬂoxacin 30 mg/kg PO q24h
Sometimes used because of lower cost than enroﬂoxacin. Lower
and more variable oral bioavailability than enroﬂoxacin,
marboﬂoxacin, and orbiﬂoxacin. Diﬃcult to justify over
approved ﬂuoroquinolones. Dosing recommendations are
empirical.
Doxycycline 3–5 mg/kg PO q12h
Highly metabolized and excreted through intestinal tract, so
urine levels may be low. Not recommended for routine uses.
Enroﬂoxacin
5 mg/kg PO q24h (cats)
10–20 mg/kg q24h (dogs)
Excreted in urine predominantly in active form. Reserve for
documented resistant UTIs but good First-line choice for
pyelonephritis (20 mg/kg PO q24h). Limited eﬃcacy against
enterococci. Associated with risk of retinopathy in cats. Do not
exceed 5 mg/kg/d of enroﬂoxacin in cats.
Imipenem-cilastatin 5 mg/kg IV/IM q6-8h
Reserve for treatment of multidrug-resistant infections,
particularly those caused by Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Recommend consultation with a urinary or
infectious disease veterinary specialist or veterinary
pharmacologist prior to use.
Marboﬂoxacin 2.7–5.5 mg/kg PO q24h
Excreted in urine predominantly in active form. Reserve for
documented resistant UTIs but good First-line choice for
pyelonephritis. Limited eﬃcacy against enterococci.
Meropenem 8.5 mg/kg SC/IV q 12 (SC) or 8 (IV)h
Reserve for treatment of multidrug-resistant infections,
particularly those caused by Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. Recommend consultation with a urinary or
infectious disease veterinary specialist or veterinary
pharmacologist prior to use.
Nitrofurantoin 4.4–5 mg/kg PO q8h
Good second-line option for simple uncomplicated UTI,
particularly when multidrug-resistant pathogens are involved.
Orbiﬂoxacin
Tablets: 2.5–7.5 mg/kg PO q24h; oral
suspension: 7.5 mg/kg PO q24h (cats) or
2.5-7.5 mg/kg PO q24h (dogs)
Excreted in urine predominantly in active form.
6 Veterinary Medicine International
Table 2: Continued.
Drug Dose Comments
Trimethoprim-sulfadiazine
15 mg/kg PO q12h
Note: dosing is based on total
trimethoprim + sulfadiazine
concentration
Good ﬁrst-line option. Concerns regarding idiosyncratic and
immune-mediated adverse eﬀects in some patients, especially
with prolonged therapy. If prolonged (>7d) therapy is
anticipated, baseline Schirmer’s tear testing is recommended,
with periodic re-evaluation and owner monitoring for ocular
discharge. Avoid in dogs that may be sensitive to potential
adverse eﬀects such as KCS, hepatopathy, hypersensitivity, and
skin eruptions.
3.1.2. Treatment of Complicated UTIs. If the clinical condi-
tion of the patient permits, consideration should be given
to waiting for culture results before starting therapy. If
treatment must be initiated immediately for patient care
reasons, a drug should be selected from those recommended
for initial treatment of simple uncomplicated UTI. Where
possible, the drug class used should be diﬀerent from that
used to treat the prior UTI(s) (i.e., if amoxicillin was used
initially, start treatment with trimethoprim-sulfadiazine).
After treatment has been initiated, continued treatment
should be based on the results of culture and susceptibility
testing. Preference should be given to drugs that are excreted
in urine predominantly in an active form. Classes of drugs
that are not predominantly excreted in urine in active form
(e.g., macrolides) should be avoided. Referral or consultation
with specialist to determine the appropriate approach is
reasonable.
The susceptibility test will typically use the S/I/R
classiﬁcation (Susceptible, Intermediate, and Resistant). If
resistant, treatment is likely to fail and the drug should
not be prescribed. If susceptible, there is a greater like-
lihood of clinical success (resolution of clinical signs of
UTI) using normal treatment regimens; however factors
such as drug absorption, drug excretion, drug inactivation,
bioﬁlm, necrotic debris, the presence of foreign materials,
development of drug resistance during treatment, inducible
resistance, laboratory error, and various comorbidities can
impact on the success of an individual treatment. The use of
drugs reported as intermediate is appropriate in situations
when the drug is physiologically concentrated at the target
site or if the dosage can be increased.
If treatment was initiated before culture, susceptibility
results were available, and the isolated organism is resistant
to the antimicrobial that was initially chosen, a change to a
more active drug based on susceptibility testing should be
made.
If more than one bacterial species is identiﬁed on initial
culture, the relevance of the each organism should be con-
sidered, based on the bacterial counts and the pathogenicity
of the organisms. For example, when present in a mixed
infection, anecdotal evidence suggests that infection by
Enterococcus spp. will often resolve when the other organism
is successfully treated. Ideally, antimicrobial therapy should
be directed against both organisms. In some instances, an
antimicrobial eﬀective against both organisms will not be
available. Combination therapy that would be potentially
eﬀective against both organisms should be considered. In
some situations, a reasonable drug or drug combination may
not be available. Targeting therapy towards the organism
perceived as the most clinically relevant is a reasonable
approach, provided there is no evidence of pyelonephritis
or underlying disease that increases the risk of systemic or
ascending infection with an organism otherwise of limited
primary pathogenicity.
There is no supporting evidence for administration of
other drugs (e.g., clarithromycin) for the purpose of breaking
down bacterial bioﬁlm.
There is no supporting evidence that direct instillation
of antimicrobials, antiseptics, or DMSO directly into the
bladder via a urinary catheter is eﬀective for treatment of
recurrent UTIs. These compounds are quickly ﬂushed out
of the bladder when the animal urinates and may be locally
irritating.
Any underlying causes should be managed appropriately,
whenever possible.
Evidence supporting the duration of therapy for com-
plicated UTI does not exist. Typically, 4 weeks of treatment
has been recommended. The Working Group agrees that it is
likely that shorter courses of appropriate treatment might be
eﬀective in some or all situations. In the face of insuﬃcient
data supporting a shorter course of therapy, 4 weeks of
treatment is a reasonable recommendation. In animals with
a nonrecurrent but complicated UTI (e.g., diabetic animal
with a ﬁrst instance of UTI and whose infection would have
been classiﬁed as uncomplicated if the comorbidity was not
present), shorter-term therapy may be more reasonable.
3.1.3. Monitoring Response to Treatment. Urine culture
should be considered 5–7 days after initiation of therapy, par-
ticularly in patients with a history of relapsing or refractory
infection, or those considered at high risk for ascending or
systemic infection.
Any bacterial growth during treatment indicates poten-
tial treatment failure and should prompt immediate re-
evaluation. Referral or consultation with a specialist is
recommended.
Urine culture is recommended 7 days after cessation of
therapy in all cases. (If the patient was treated with cefovecin,
the prolonged excretion of the drug must be considered.
Optimal timing of sampling in such cases is unclear, but
testing 3 weeks after the last dose may be reasonable.) If
a positive urine culture is obtained after treatment, more
in-depth investigation of predisposing factors for relapse or
reinfection should be performed. Referral should be strongly
Veterinary Medicine International 7
considered. Unless there is clear evidence for the reason for
failure, retreatment without any other investigation is not
recommended. If no signs of disease are present, these cases
should be managed as described for subclinical bacteriuria.
If there is lack of clinical response to treatment or if clin-
ical signs of UTI recur after apparently successful treatment,
the animal should be managed again as described above, with
particular emphasis on determination of underlying causes.
Referral is strongly recommended.
3.1.4. Preventive Measures. There is insuﬃcient evidence to
recommend use of either pulse (intermittent) or chronic low-
dose therapy for prevention of UTIs. The eﬀect of these prac-
tices on emergence of resistance should be considered. There
is anecdotal evidence that a small percentage of animals
with severe clinical signs may require such an approach, but
only after thorough evaluation for underlying causes, ideally
by a specialist in small animal internal medicine. Although
there may be some theoretical beneﬁt for the administration
of urinary antiseptics such as methenamine (methenamine
hippurate), there is currently insuﬃcient evidence available
to assess the eﬀectiveness of these treatments in animals.
There is currently insuﬃcient evidence to support the
administration of other adjunctive therapies to prevent
recurrent infections. Although there is some evidence for
a beneﬁt of nutritional supplements (e.g., cranberry juice
extract) for this indication in humans, the evidence is not
strong and some studies have shown no eﬀect [10–13].
Currently, there are no data to support the beneﬁts of
these measures in veterinary medicine. When eﬀective in
people, dietary supplements may help to prevent but not
treat UTIs. When selecting cranberry-based treatments, one
should be aware of the variability in quality and potency
of over-the-counter products and, based on human studies
and in vitro work, should choose an extract that has a
higher concentration of proanthocyanidins, the antioxidants
thought to be responsible for antibacterial eﬀects.
4. Subclinical Bacteriuria
Subclinical bacteriuria is the presence of bacteria in the urine
as determined by positive bacterial culture, in the absence of
clinical and cytological evidence of UTI.
4.1. Summary of Recommendations. Treatment may not be
necessary in animals that have no clinical signs of UTI and
no evidence of UTI based on examination of urine sediment.
In some circumstances, treatment may be considered
if there is concern that there is a particularly high risk of
ascending or systemic infection (e.g., immunocompromised
patients, patients with underlying renal disease) or that the
bladder may be a focus of extraurinary infection. Diagnosis
and management of the underlying cause is critical and
treatment should not be used as a replacement for proper
diagnosis and management.
The presence of multidrug-resistant bacterium does not
represent, by itself, an indication for treatment. Anecdotal
information suggests that multidrug-resistant organisms
will sometimes be replaced with susceptible organisms if
treatment is withheld, and then treatment with routine
antimicrobials may be more practical if decolonization is
desired or if clinical disease develops.
5. Urinary Catheters
UTI and subclinical bacterial colonization of the bladder
are commonly identiﬁed in dogs with indwelling urinary
catheters [14, 15]. Diﬀerentiating these two is important
because the approach to management of infection versus
colonization is diﬀerent.
5.1. Animals with Urinary Catheters: No Clinical Signs of
Infection. Culture for diagnosis of the presence of bacteria
in urine is not recommended in the absence of clinical signs
consistent with an active infection.
It is not necessary to treat catheterized animals with
bacteriuria in the absence of clinical or cytological evidence
supporting the presence of an infection.
Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy for prevention of UTI
in catheterized animals is never indicated.
5.2. Animals with Urinary Catheters: When Urinary Catheter
Is Being Removed. There is no evidence supporting the need
to culture the catheter tip at time of catheter removal since
catheter tip culture results are not predictive of development
of catheter-associated UTI [16]. There is also no evidence
supporting routine culture of urine after catheter removal.
However, culture of the urine (ideally collected by cystocen-
tesis after catheter removal) may be reasonable in patients in
which the risk and implications of UTI are high (e.g., recently
obstructed male cat with at high risk for reobstruction).
Clinical monitoring and cytological examination to detect a
potential UTI are preferred to urine culture in a patient with
no signs of UTI.
There is no indication for routine (prophylactic) antimi-
crobial treatment following urinary catheter removal in an
animal with no clinical or cytological evidence of active UTI.
6. Animals with a Urinary Catheter and
Signs of a UTI
UTI should be suspected in catheterized animals exhibiting
clinical signs of infection. However, such patients may not
be easily identiﬁed. As such, infection should be suspected
in all cases of fever of unknown origin or bacteremia
with an unknown focus. Infection should also be suspected
when there are gross or cytological (i.e., hematuria, pyuria)
abnormalities.
Urine culture should always be performed if infection
is suspected. If a catheter must remain in place and signs
of UTI are present, the catheter should be replaced and a
urine sample collected through the new catheter for culture.
Several milliliters of urine should be withdrawn to clear the
catheter and discarded prior to obtaining the sample for
culture.
When possible, catheters should be removed and urine
sampled by cystocentesis after an appropriate period of time
has passed for the bladder to ﬁll with urine. Less ideal is a
8 Veterinary Medicine International
sample collected from the urinary catheter prior to removal,
in which case positive cultures should ideally be conﬁrmed
with a subsequent cystocentesis sample. In all instances,
cultures should be quantitative.
Urine culture should never be performed from the
collection bag.
Culture of the catheter tip after removal is not recom-
mended.
Treatment is more likely to be successful if the catheter
can be removed. The costbeneﬁt of removing or retaining the
catheter should be considered in the context of management
of the UTI and the patient’s underlying disease condition.
Treatment should be selected and administered as per recom-
mendations for primary uncomplicated UTI or complicated
UTI, as appropriate based on a prior history of UTI and
the presence of ongoing comorbidities or risk factors. If the
patient has not had recurrent infections, the catheter has
been removed and no relevant comorbidities are presented as
a simple uncomplicated UTI is indicated. Otherwise, patients
should be managed as complicated UTIs.
7. Upper Urinary Tract
Infections (Pyelonephritis)
7.1. Diagnosis. Culture and susceptibility testing should
always be performed. Cystocentesis samples should be used
for culture whenever possible. If cystocentesis is not possible
because of the presence of little urine in the bladder, a sample
obtained by urinary catheter is acceptable, but not ideal.
Positive cultures should be conﬁrmed by a subsequent cysto-
centesis sample, whenever possible. Other general principles
of diagnosis, as described under Simple Uncomplicated UTI,
apply.
Interpretation of susceptibility data should be based
on antimicrobial breakpoints for serum rather than urine
concentrations. If multiple organisms are isolated, the sus-
pected relative relevance of these should be considered. This
assessment would include the bacterial species and colony
counts, as is discussed above.
7.2. Treatment. Treatment should be initiated immediately,
while awaiting culture and susceptibility results. Initial
treatment should involve antimicrobial drugs known to have
local or regional eﬃcacy against Gram-negative Enterobac-
teriaceae, based on the predominance of those organisms
in pyelonephritis. If regional data are supportive, treatment
with a ﬂuoroquinolone excreted in urine in the active form
(e.g., not diﬂoxacin) is a reasonable ﬁrst choice. If ascending
infection is suspected, urine culture results obtained for
diagnosis of lower UTI might be the basis of initial therapy.
If the upper UTI results from hematogenous spread, initial
therapy should be based on cultures of blood or the infected
site, whenever available.
While treatment will be started before culture results
are available, the culture and susceptibility data should be
reviewed when results are received. If combination therapy
was initiated and the isolate is susceptible to both drugs, one
might be discontinued if supported by evidence of clinical
response. If resistance is reported to one of the drugs, that
antimicrobial should be discontinued. A second drug to
which the isolate is susceptible should be substituted if the
patient has not responded suﬃciently; substitution is not
necessary if patient response has been suﬃcient. If resistance
is reported to both antimicrobials and clinical evidence of
improvement is not evident, antimicrobial treatment should
be changed to a drug to which the oﬀending organism is
susceptible in vitro. Consultation with a specialist is indicated
with multidrug-resistant organisms.
Treatment of 4–6 weeks is often recommended. A shorter
duration of therapy might be eﬀective; however there is
currently inadequate evidence to provide objective recom-
mendations, and 4–6 weeks of treatment is recommended at
this time.
7.3. Monitoring Therapy. Urinalysis and culture should be
performed 1 week from the start of treatment because of
potential severity of disease and long treatment duration. If
the same organism is isolated, one should consider adding an
antimicrobial to which the organism is susceptible in vitro, if
possible. Consultation with a specialist is recommended.
If polymicrobial infection was present initially and
only 1 organism remains, consultation with a specialist is
recommended to determine the relative clinical relevance
of the isolates and treatment plan. Treatment should not
necessarily be changed because it is possible that the primary
pathogen has been eliminated and changing therapy could
result in regrowth of that organism.
Culture is recommended 1 week after cessation of therapy
to ensure elimination of infection.
8. Multidrug-Resistant Infections
Multidrug-resistant pathogens, including various Enter-
obacteriaceae, staphylococci, and enterococci, are becom-
ing increasingly problematic. Multidrug-resistant pathogens
may be harder to treat because of limited drug choices.
There are public health concerns with regard to the potential
for zoonotic transmission of resistant pathogens. Additional
concerns result from the increasing pressure to use antimi-
crobials in animals that are critically important in human
medicine.
Addressing the globally increasing issue of antimicrobial
resistance is complex and diﬃcult. Because of the high
incidence of antimicrobial use in UTIs of dogs and cats,
veterinarians must be cognizant of the role of inappropriate
treatment in the emergence and dissemination of multidrug-
resistant pathogens. At the same time, the Working Group
believes that prudent (and therefore rare) use of certain
drugs in the treatment of canine and feline UTIs would
constitute a miniscule fraction of overall use of these critical
drugs. As such, use of critically important antimicrobials in
companion animals can be justiﬁed as long as their use is
prudent and proper, based on culture and susceptibility data
as well as patient care and welfare reasons In particular, the
use of drugs such as vancomycin, carbapenems, and linezolid
is not justiﬁed unless the following criteria are met.
(i) Infection must be documented based on clinical,
culture, and cytological abnormalities. The use of
Veterinary Medicine International 9
these drugs for the treatment of subclinical infection
is not supported.
(ii) Resistance to all other reasonable options and sus-
ceptibility to the chosen antimicrobial must be
documented.
(iii) The infection must be potentially treatable. The use
of critical drugs in situations where there is little real-
istic chance of elimination of infection (e.g., failure to
remove the underlying cause) is not supported.
(iv) Consultation with someone with expertise in infec-
tious diseases and antimicrobial therapy must be
obtained to determine whether there are any other
viable options and whether treatment is reasonable.
9. Conclusions
Urinary tract disease is a common reason for antimicrobial
therapy in dogs and cats. Proper and prompt diagnosis of
UTI is required to allow for informed treatment decisions to
be made, and careful scrutiny of patient history, clinical signs,
urinalysis results, as well as culture and susceptibility data, is
required for optimal case management. Successful treatment
should not only involve elimination of the clinically apparent
infection, it should also do so while minimizing the risks
of complications such as struvite urolithiasis, ascending or
systemic infection, recurrent infection, or development of
antimicrobial resistance. While there are major limitations in
available data, including a complete lack of published eﬃcacy
studies for dogs and cats, these comprehensive practice
guidelines will assist with optimal management of UTIs in
dogs and cats.
