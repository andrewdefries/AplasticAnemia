Abstract
An ability to sense pathogens by a number of specialized cell types including the dendritic cells plays a central role in host’s
defenses. Activation of these cells through the stimulation of the pathogen-recognition receptors induces the production of
a number of cytokines including Type I interferons (IFNs) that mediate the diverse mechanisms of innate immunity. Type I
IFNs interact with the Type I IFN receptor, composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains, to mount the host defense responses.
However, at the same time, Type I IFNs elicit potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects that could be detrimental for
IFN-producing cells. Here, we report that the activation of p38 kinase in response to pathogen-recognition receptors
stimulation results in a series of phosphorylation events within the IFNAR1 chain of the Type I IFN receptor. This
phosphorylation promotes IFNAR1 ubiquitination and accelerates the proteolytic turnover of this receptor leading to an
attenuation of Type I IFN signaling and the protection of activated dendritic cells from the cytotoxic effects of autocrine or
paracrine Type I IFN. In this paper we discuss a potential role of this mechanism in regulating the processes of innate
immunity.

Introduction
Cytokines that belong to the family of Type I interferons (IFNs,
including IFNa/b), play an important role in innate immunity
[1,2,3,4]. These cytokines are produced by various cell types
including dendritic cells (DCs), which are equipped with a diverse
set of specialized pathogen recognition receptors (PRR) that
recognize a variety of pathogens. Activation of PRR in DCs is
known to induce the production of numerous cytokines including
inflammatory cytokines and IFNa/b. The latter cytokines
modulate the subsequent antigen-specific adaptive immune
responses and mount the overall host defenses against infection
and injury (reviewed in [5,6,7]).
Type I IFN mediates its effects through the stimulation of the
Type I IFN receptor (which consists of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2
chains) and the subsequent activation of the Janus kinases TYK2
and JAK1, phosphorylation of STAT1/2 proteins, and ensuing
trans-activation of a plethora of interferon-stimulated genes. The
products of these genes directly suppress the spread of some
pathogens (e.g., viruses) and cooperate with inflammatory
cytokines in DCs to promote antigen presentation linking innate
and adaptive immunity (reviewed in [8,9,10]). Some of these genes
also elicit pronounced anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects
[10]. Conversely, cells that produce IFNa/b have to survive in this
environment and have to be protected from autocrine/paracrine
IFNa/b [11].
Accordingly, Type I IFNs play a dynamic role in homeostasis
and in the function of DCs [12]. Whereas IFNa/b contribute to
the maturation and activation of DCs [13,14,15], these cytokines
are also known to decrease the viability of IFNa/b-producing DCs
[4,12,16]. Additional mechanisms of negative regulation are
expected to prevent a hypothetical scenario where IFNa/b-
stimulated maturation of DCs and subsequent production of more
of IFNa/b by these DCs spirals out of control and leads to a
hyperactivation of pathways induced by Type I IFN. Such
hyperactivation of the IFNa/b pathways might be detrimental,
not only to a population of specific IFN-producing cells, but also to
the entire host because it leads to autoimmune disorders. A key
role of IFNa/b in pathogenesis of such disorders, including
psoriases, systemic lupus erythematosus and Type 1 diabetes
mellitus, has been thoroughly documented [17,18,19,20]. There-
fore, developing an understanding of the mechanisms, by which
IFNa/b responses are kept in check, is of medical importance.
All responses to IFNa/b require the presence of the Type I IFN
receptor at the cell surface [21]. Upon interacting with the ligands,
this receptor not only conducts the forward signaling through the
JAK-STAT pathway but also undergoes rapid downregulation
[22,23]. This downregulation is driven by the phosphorylation-
dependent ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation of the
IFNAR1 chain [24,25]. Ubiquitination of IFNAR1 is facilitated by
the SCFbTrcp
E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is recruited to the receptor
upon phosphorylation on serine residues (S535 in humans, S526 in

mice) within IFNAR1’s degron [25,26]. Such phosphorylation can
be induced by a ligand in a TYK2 activity-dependent manner [27]
through the activation of protein kinase D2 [28]. This ligand-
inducible pathway limits the extent of IFNa/b signaling in the cells
that have already been exposed to these cytokines.
We have recently discovered an alternative (TYK2 activity-
independent) signaling pathway that leads to S535 phosphoryla-
tion and to the subsequent ubiquitination and downregulation of
IFNAR1 in the absence of a ligand. As a result, IFNAR1 is being
removed from the surface of those cells, which have not been yet
exposed to IFNa/b [29]. Accordingly, this signaling does not
require the ligand and hence can impair the ability of a naı¨ve cell
to respond to its future encounters with IFNa/b. Such a pathway
can be further stimulated by the inducers of the unfolded protein
response (UPR). UPR is a complex of signaling pathways that are
essential for protein quality control in cells [30,31] and can be
induced by various stress stimuli such as thapsigargin (TG) as well
as by viral infection [32]. Inducers of UPR (including RNA-
containing viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus, VSV, and
hepatitis C virus, HCV) were shown to promote IFNAR1
degradation via a pathway that required the activation of a PKR-
like ER kinase (PERK, [33]). Subsequent delineation of the
ligand-independent pathway revealed an important role for
casein kinase 1a (CK1a) in the direct phosphorylation of S535/
S526 within the IFNAR1 degron [34]. The ability of constitu-
tively active CK1a to phosphorylate the IFNAR1 degron was
augmented in cells treated with UPR inducers or infected with
VSV via priming phosphorylation of another serine – S532 (S523
in mouse IFNAR1). The latter phosphorylation was mediated by
a yet to be identified kinase that functioned downstream of PERK
[35].
Here we report that the DNA-containing herpes simplex virus
(HSV) also induced the ligand/TYK2-independent phosphory-
lation and downregulation of IFNAR1. Remarkably, these
effects required neither viral protein synthesis nor PERK
activity but relied on the activation of the PRR signaling
pathways that center around the activation of the p38 protein
kinase. This kinase was required for the phosphorylation of the
IFNAR1 priming site leading to an ensuing phosphorylation of
the IFNAR1 degron on Ser535/526, acceleration of IFNAR1
degradation, and attenuation of IFNa/b signaling. These events
appear to be important for the protection of DCs from
autocrine/paracrine Type I IFN.
Results
Herpes Simplex Virus downregulates IFNAR1 via the
ligand independent pathway
RNA-containing viruses (HCV and VSV) can downregulate
IFNAR1 in human KR-2 cells that harbor a catalytically inactive
TYK2 and that are deficient in IFNa-stimulated Ser535
phosphorylation of IFNAR1 and the degradation of this receptor
chain [27,33]. We sought to investigate whether a DNA-
containing virus such as the herpes simplex virus (HSV) is also
capable of such activity. We observed that the infection of KR-2
cells with HSV stimulates degron phosphorylation of endogenous
human IFNAR1 and robustly downregulates the levels of this
receptor (Figure 1A). A marked decrease in cell surface levels of
murine IFNAR1 in response to HSV infection was also seen in
mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs, Figure 1B).
To determine whether downregulation of IFNAR1 by HSV
depends on IFNAR1 degron phosphorylation, we have generated
a knock-in mouse that expresses a phosphorylation-deficient
IFNAR1 mutant. To this end, mouse ES cells, in which one wild
type Ifnar1 allele was replaced with a mutant allele that lacks
Ser526 (a serine residue homologous to Ser535 within human
IFNAR1; cells were described in [33]) were rid of the Neo cassette.
They were then used to generate knock-in mice that express the
IFNAR1S526A
mutant (‘‘SA’’, Figure S1). Importantly, MEFs
derived from these mice were noticeably resistant to an HSV-
induced downregulation of IFNAR1 levels on the cell surface
(Figure 1B). This result suggests that HSV downregulates IFNAR1
in a degron phosphorylation-dependent manner.
Given that HSV has been known to induce the production of
both IFNa and IFNb [36], we next sought to delineate the
mechanisms by which HSV infection stimulates the phosphor-
ylation of IFNAR1 degron. We chose to analyze endogenous
IFNAR1 in human fibrosarcoma-derived cell lines harvested at
the earlier time points (20–22 hr) of HSV infection at low MOI
(0.1). Under these conditions, the total levels of IFNAR1 were
not yet dramatically downregulated, enabling a better detection
of Ser535 phosphorylation. HSV infection of WT-5 cells that
express wild type TYK2 [37,38] induced a robust S535
phosphorylation of IFNAR1 (Figure 1C). Comparable levels
of IFNAR1 degron phosphorylation were seen in the isogenic
KR-2, which express kinase-dead TYK2 and are responsive to
IFNb [38] but not to IFNa [27,37] suggesting that the activity
of TYK2 is not required for the effects of the virus. On the
contrary, the phosphorylation of IFNAR1 Ser535 in response
to treatment with recombinant IFNb was much less evident in
KR-2 cells that displayed only a rather modest STAT1
phosphorylation in response to this cytokine (Figure 1C).
Furthermore, in either WT-5 or KR-2 cells, infection with
HSV hardly induced any STAT1 phosphorylation indicating
that an increase in IFNAR1 degron phosphorylation may not
rely on HSV-induced production of Type I IFN. Finally, in the
isogenic fibrosarcoma U5A, cells that lack the IFNAR2 chain of
the Type I IFN receptor and are insensitive to any Type I IFN
[39], infection with HSV robustly induced Ser535 phosphor-
ylation of IFNAR1 (Figure 1C). These results suggest that the
effects of HSV on phosphorylation of IFNAR1 are ligand-
independent.
These isogenic WT-5, KR-2 and U5A cell lines were infected
with HSV for longer periods of time to determine the role of
TYK2 kinase activity and endogenous Type I IFN in downreg-
ulation. A comparable decrease of IFNAR1 levels in response to
infection was seen in WT-5 and KR-2 cells. Furthermore, HSV
robustly decreased levels of IFNAR1 in U5A cells (Figure 1D).
Author Summary
We have previously observed and reported that the
activation of unfolded protein responses during infection
with some viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus and
hepatitis C virus compromises the cellular responses to the
cytokines that belong to family of Type I interferons (IFNa/
b). These effects apparently rely on the activation of a
specific protein kinase termed PERK that transduces
signals from unfolded proteins to accelerate phosphory-
lation-dependent degradation of the IFNa/b receptor. Here
we found that the same pathway can be PERK-indepen-
dent and can be stimulated by signaling induced in the
specialized cells (e.g. dendritic cells that produce IFNa/b),
which recognize pathogens (e.g. viruses). This work
delineates a mechanism by which the degradation of
IFNa/b receptor is accelerated. Our studies also highlight
the importance of this mechanism for limiting the
magnitude and the duration of IFNa/b signaling and
maintaining the survival of IFN-producing dendritic cells.

These results indicate that neither production of the endogenous
ligands nor catalytic activities of TYK2 are required for IFNAR1
downregulation in cells infected with HSV.
Given the latter results we sought to determine whether,
similarly to VSV, the effects of HSV infection on IFNAR1 might
be mediated by the constitutively active kinase CK1a [34] whose
ability to phosphorylate IFNAR1 degron is augmented by a
priming phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on S532 [35]. Phosphory-
lation of the degron (S535) in HSV-infected KR-2 cells was
indeed attenuated by treating the cells with a CK1 inhibitor
(Figure 2A). Furthermore, HSV infection induced the priming
phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on S532 (Figures 1C and 2A–C) and
IFNAR1 ubiquitination (Figures 2B–C). The IFNAR1S532A
mutant lacking the priming site was noticeably more resistant
to the HSV-stimulated ubiquitination and downregulation than
the wild type receptor (Figures 2C–D). Together, these results
suggest that, similar to VSV, HSV stimulates the ligand/TYK2-
independent pathway of IFNAR1 phosphorylation-dependent
ubiquitination and downregulation that requires the priming
phosphorylation.

PERK is not required for phosphorylation and
downregulation of IFNAR1 in response to HSV
The experimental settings of all these experiments included
infection at low doses (MOI 0.1) that did not induce changes in the
status of IFNAR1 (data not shown) until later periods of the
infection (24–30 h post infection) which were chosen for the
maximal expression of viral proteins to induce UPR. Under these
conditions, HCV and VSV required PERK activity to promote
IFNAR1 phosphorylation and degradation [33]. Although KR-2
cells display a noticeable increase in the phosphorylation of
translational regulator eIF2a (a major PERK substrate) in response
to thapsigargin or VSV [33,35], stimulation of this signaling event
by HSV infection was modest at best (Figure 2A). These results are
consistent with previous reports that attributed low levels of eIF2a
phosphorylation either to the stimulation of eIF2a de-phosphory-
lation by the HSV protein c134.5 under conditions where PERK is
activated [40] or to the suppression of PERK activation by the viral
glycoprotein B [41]. Under the conditions used in our experiments
in KR-2 cells to influence the phosphorylation of IFNAR1 degron,
an induction of PERK phosphorylation (indicative of its activation)
was observed in response to thapsigargin but not to infection with
HSV (Figures 3B–C). Both thapsigargin and HSV infection
stimulated the priming phosphorylation of IFNAR1 on Ser532 in
KR-2 cells. Whereas the knockdown of PERK noticeably
attenuated the effects of thapsigargin, priming phosphorylation of
IFNAR1 stimulated by, HSV infection was impervious to the
modulations of PERK expression (Figure 3C). This result suggests
that PERK is dispensable for HSV-stimulated IFNAR1 phosphor-
ylation in human cells.
We further tested the requirement of PERK by using MEFs
from mice harboring a conditional knockout allele of PERK
(PERKfl/fl
) where PERK is acutely excised upon transduction with
a retrovirus encoding the Cre recombinase [42]. Consistent with a
previous report [33], the acute deletion of PERK prevented the
downregulation of IFNAR1 upon VSV infection. However, the
downregulation of IFNAR1 stimulated by HSV was not affected
by the status of PERK (Figure 3D). These data suggest that HSV is
capable of stimulating the ligand-independent pathway in a
manner that differs from viral protein synthesis-induced UPR and
activation of PERK described for HCV and VSV.
We next tested a possibility that a requirement for prolonged
infection and ensuing HSV replication needed to observe the
effects of low doses of HSV (MOI 0.1) might be foregone if more
viruses are used initially. To this end, we compared the effects of
HSV (at MOI 5.0) that was either sham treated or irradiated with
UV for inactivation. The latter procedure decreased the titer of
this viral preparation from 76107
to 3 pfu. Remarkably, the
treatment of KR-2 cells with a high dose of either active or
inactive HSV sufficed for inducing the priming phosphorylation of
IFNAR1 within 60–90 minutes (Figure 4A). Furthermore,
treatment with either active or inactive HSV comparably
decreased the levels of IFNAR1 (Figure 4B) indicating that the
downregulation of IFNAR1 can be stimulated by HSV in a
manner that does not require virus replication.
Figure 2. HSV induces priming phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and downregulation of IFNAR1. (A) KR-2 cells were
infected with HSV (MOI 0.1) and were treated with either DMSO (control) or CK1 inhibitor D4476 (12.5 mM for 1 h) before harvesting at 0, 21, or 23 h
post-infection. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the IFNAR1 antibody and analyzed by IB with the indicated antibodies. (B) KR-2 cells were
infected with HSV (MOI 0.1) and were harvested at 22 or 24 h post-infection. Cell lysates were analyzed by IFNAR1 IP followed by IB using antibodies
against ubiquitin, phospho-S532, and IFNAR1. (C) KR-2 cells expressing Flag-IFNAR1 (wild type or S532A mutant) were infected with HSV (MOI 0.1)
and harvested 24 h post-infection. The phosphorylation and ubiquitination of Flag-IFNAR1 were analyzed by IP using anti-Flag antibodies followed
by an IB analysis as described in panel D. (D) KR-2 cells expressing the indicated Flag-IFNAR1 (wild type or S532A mutant) were infected with HSV
(MOI 0.1) and harvested 30 h post-infection. Levels of exogenous IFNAR1 and b-actin were analyzed by IB using the indicated antibodies.

The downregulation of IFNAR1 can plausibly occur through
diverse mechanisms including an increase in protein degradation
and decrease in protein synthesis mediated by translational or pre-
translational events (e.g., a decrease in mRNA levels). To
determine the role of IFNAR1 proteolytic turnover in this process
we used a standard approach of blocking the protein synthesis by
treating the cells with cycloheximide. Under these conditions, the
treatment of cells with inactivated HSV markedly accelerated the
rate of degradation of either endogenous IFNAR1 (Figure 4C) or
exogenously expressed Flag-tagged IFNAR1 (Figure 4D). Impor-
tantly, inactivated HSV did not increase the rate of proteolytic
turnover for the priming site deficient IFNAR1S532A
mutant
(Figure 4D). Together, these results suggest that HSV rapidly
initiates a specific PERK-independent signaling pathway that
leads to IFNAR1 priming phosphorylation and degradation.
Pathogen receptor recognition signaling induces IFNAR1
phosphorylation and degradation
One possibility is that such a signaling pathway could be
initiated by the recognition of pathogen patterns within inactivated
HSV. HSV was reported to activate Toll like receptors (TLR),
including TLR9, via viral genomic DNA [43,44] as well as TLR2
via an unidentified molecular structure on the virion [45]. While
we failed to detect an increase in priming or degron phosphor-
ylation of IFNAR1 in KR-2 cells upon treatment with an activator
of TLR2 muramyl dipeptide (MDP, data not shown), such
phosphorylation was readily observed when KR-2 cells were
treated with HSV or with TLR9 inducer CpG (Figure 5A).
Whereas these results do not prove or disprove the participation of
specific TLR in IFNAR1 phosphorylation mediated by HSV, they
indicate a possibility that the stimulation of PRR signaling in
general might lead to the same result.
To test this possibility, we aimed to determine whether other
known inducers of PRR signaling were capable of stimulating
priming phosphorylation of IFNAR1. To this end, we switched
from KR-2 fibrosarcoma cells to the types of cells that actually
function to present foreign antigens, and, accordingly, express
numerous types of pathogen recognition receptors. The treatment
of human monocytic U937 cells with inducers of TLR9 (CpG) or
TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) led to a robust phosphorylation of
IFNAR1 on its priming site (Figures 5B, C). Furthermore, an
increase in Ser532 phosphorylation of IFNAR1 in U937 cells was
also seen in response to other inducers of PRR such as the TLR3
ligand poly I:C and NOD2/TLR2/TLR4 ligand MDP, and in
Figure 3. Phosphorylation-dependent downregulation of IFNAR1 by HSV occurs in a PERK-independent manner. (A) KR-2 cells were
uninfected or infected with VSV (MOI 0.1 for 12 and 14 h) or HSV (MOI 0.1 for 14 and 30 h). Cell lysates were analyzed by IB using the indicated
antibodies.(B) KR-2 cells were treated with thapsigargin (TG, 1 mM for 30 min) or infected with HSV (MOI 0.1 for 22 h). Phosphorylation and total
levels of PERK were analyzed using the indicated antibodies. (C) KR-2 cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors that express shRNA against PERK or
against GFP (shCON, used as a control) and treated or infected as described in panel B. The phosphorylation and levels of IFNAR1 in
immunoprecipitates and phosphorylation and levels of PERK and b-actin in whole cell lysates (WCL) were analyzed using the indicated antibodies. (D)
MEFs from PERKfl/fl
mice were transduced with an empty lentivirus (Mock) or lentiviral vector for the expression of Cre recombinase. Cells were then
left untreated (magenta line) or infected with VSV (MOI 0.1 for 14 h, blue line) or HSV (MOI 0.1 for 30 h, red line). Cell surface IFNAR1 levels were
analyzed by FACS.

response to high doses of inactivated VSV (Figure 5D). It is
plausible that our previous studies, designed to test the effects of
VSV using infection at low MOI and analyzed at the late time
point of infection when the induction of UPR is at its maximum,
[33] had missed this early effect.
Role of p38 kinase in pathogen receptor signaling-
induced IFNAR1 phosphorylation and degradation
Signaling pathways triggered by the activation of PRR are
known to induce a number of important regulatory kinases such as
Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), IkB kinases (IKK), stress-activated
p38 protein kinases, and mitogen-activated Erk kinases (reviewed
in [6]). The pre-treatment of U937 cells with a pharmacologic
inhibitor of p38 kinase (SB203580) prevented an increase in
priming phosphorylation of IFNAR1 in response to LPS. Such an
effect was not observed when the JNK inhibitor SP600125 was
used (Figure 5C). The inhibition of p38 kinase by SB203580
decreased the phosphorylation of S532 in response to all tested
inducers of PRR signaling (Figure 5D). These results collectively
implicate p38 protein kinase in mediating the priming phosphor-
ylation of IFNAR1 in response to PRR signaling.
To further investigate the contribution of the p38 kinase, we
used an in vitro assay in which S532 phosphorylation of
bacterially-produced GST-IFNAR1 by cell lysates (as a source of
kinase activity) was assessed by immunoblotting using a phosho-
S532-specific antibody (as in [35]). Under these conditions, lysates
from cells treated with UV-inactivated HSV exhibited a greater
ability to phosphorylate GST-IFNAR1 on S532 in vitro than
lysates from untreated cells. This activity could be tempered by
adding p38 inhibitors (SB203580 or VX702) but not by adding the
JNK inhibitor SP6000125 (Figure 6A). Furthermore, recombinant
p38 kinase was capable of incorporating radiolabeled phosphate
groups into the wild type GST-IFNAR1 protein whereas this
incorporation was lower when the GST-IFNAR1S532A
mutant was
used as a substrate (Figure 6B). Finally, the Flag-tagged p38a
kinase immunopurified from KR-2 cells was capable of phos-
phorylating GST-IFNAR1 on S532 in an immunokinase reaction
(Figure 6C). This activity was increased when the kinase was
purified from cells pre-treated with inactivated HSV. Importantly,
no activity was observed when either the catalytically inactive
p38AGF
mutant was used as a source of kinase or when the
phosphorylation-deficient GST-IFNAR1S532A
mutant was used as
a substrate (Figure 6C). Given that the knock-down of endogenous
p38a in U937 cells by shRNA also noticeably decreased the extent
of S532 phosphorylation of endogenous IFNAR1 (Figure 6D),
these results collectively suggest that the p38 kinase activated by
PRR signaling mediates the phosphorylation of the priming site on
IFNAR1. Whereas these data indicate that p38 kinase is capable of
phosphorylating Ser532, our results do not exclude the possibility
that another kinase that associates with p38 and depends on p38
activation could function as a direct priming kinase.
Consistent with the importance of priming phosphorylation in
the ligand-independent pathway, the treatment of U937 cells with
LPS activated p38 kinase and also stimulated the phosphorylation
Figure 4. Phosphorylation, downregulation and degradation of IFNAR1 can be stimulated by inactivated HSV. (A) The stock of HSV
was inactivated or not with UV and used to treat KR-2 cells at MOI 5.0 for indicated time points. Cell lysates were analyzed by IP using the anti-IFNAR1
antibody and IB using indicated antibodies. (B) KR-2 cells were treated with either UV- or sham-treated HSV as shown in panel A. The levels of IFNAR1
and b-actin were assessed as in Figure 1D. (C) KR-2 cells were untreated or treated with UV-inactivated HSV (MOI 5.0) in the presence of
cycloheximide (20 mg/mL) for indicated times. Analyses of total levels of IFNAR1 (assessed by IP-IB) and b-actin (as a loading control) are depicted. (D)
KR-2 cells expressing the indicated Flag-IFNAR1 proteins were treated as shown in panel D. The levels of exogenous IFNAR1 were analyzed by IB
using the anti-Flag antibody.

of S535 within the degron of IFNAR1 (Figure 6E). This
phosphorylation was compromised by pre-treating the cells with
a p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580. An important observation to
note here is that this compound did not affect the Ser535
phosphorylation stimulated by IFNa (Figure 6E). Given that IFNa
is a poor inducer of priming phosphorylation and of p38 activation
and is capable of stimulating the degron phosphorylation
independently of the priming site ([35] and Figure 6E), it appears
that the role of p38 kinase in IFNAR1 phosphorylation is largely
limited to the ligand-independent pathway. Furthermore, these
results (together with a rather poor induction of STAT1
phosphorylation in cells treated with LPS under conditions
reported in Figure 6E) render unlikely the possibility that
phosphorylation of the IFNAR1 degron in response to PRR
signaling is indirectly mediated by autocrine IFNa/b.
We then investigated the effects of PRR signaling on the
degradation of IFNAR1. Consistent with previous reports in other
cell lines [27,29], treatment of U937 cells with IFNa markedly
increased the rate of IFNAR1 turnover (Figure 6F); a similar effect
observed upon the LPS treatment. Importantly, the effects of LPS
(but not of IFNa) were blocked by pre-treating the cells with a p38
kinase inhibitor (Figure 6F). These results indicate that PRR
signaling specifically accelerates the degradation of IFNAR1
through the activation of p38 kinase whereas this kinase is
dispensable for the stimulation of IFNAR1 proteolytic turnover by
IFNa.
Pathogen recognition receptor signaling impedes
cellular responses to Type I IFN
We next sought to investigate whether the acceleration of
IFNAR1 degradation by PRR signaling may attenuate the cellular
responses to Type I IFN. We focused on the activation of STAT1
(assessed by its tyrosine phosphorylation) in mouse bone marrow
macrophages that robustly responded to exogenous murine IFNb,
and where such a response could be readily abolished if
neutralizing antibodies against IFNa and IFNb were added to
the reaction (Figure 7A, lanes 1–2 and 13–14). These settings were
then used to examine the effect of PRR activators on the extent of
IFN signaling. To this end, we pre-treated cells with various
combinations of PRR activator LPS, p38 kinase inhibitor
SB203580, and IFNa/b neutralizing antibodies. We then washed
off the pre-treatment agents and proceeded to treat the cells with
exogenous IFNb and detect STAT1 phosphorylation.
The pre-treatment of macrophages with LPS alone noticeably
increased the basal levels of STAT1 phosphorylation (Figure 7A,
lane 3 vs 1). A similar result was observed when pre-treatment with
LPS also included anti-IFNa/b neutralizing antibodies (lane 9 vs.
3). This outcome suggests that the effects of LPS on STAT1
phosphorylation should not be attributed to production of
endogenous Type I IFN and were likely mediated by other
cytokines (for example, IFNl that is known to be produced upon
PRR stimulation [46,47,48]). However, the activation of STAT1
in response to the subsequent addition of exogenous IFNb was

noticeably impaired in cells pre-treated with LPS (Figure 7A,
compare lanes 2 and 4). This result suggests that the activation of
PRR in cells prior to their encounter with Type I IFN may temper
future responses of a cell to these cytokines.
Remarkably, the suppressive effect of LPS on IFNb signaling
was partially alleviated when pre-treatment with LPS was carried
out in the presence of the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580
(Figure 7A, lane 8 vs. lane 4). Given that the effects of the p38
inhibitor were largely unaffected by adding the neutralizing
antibodies to the pre-treatment combination of LPS and
SB203580 (Figure 7A, lane 12 vs. lane 8), it is unlikely that the
inhibitor acted through stimulating an additional production of
endogenous Type I IFN. Collectively, these results suggest that
PRR signaling-induced activation of p38 kinase in cells may
attenuate their responses to a subsequent exposure to Type I IFN.
To further determine whether the suppression of IFN signaling by
PRR inducers requires IFNAR1 phosphorylation, we used the
knock-in mice harboring the IFNAR1S526A
mutant, which is
insensitive to downregulation in response to HSV infection
(Figure 1B). Whereas pre-treatment with LPS dramatically inhibited
IFNb-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in bone marrow macro-
phages from wild type mice, this inhibition was not seen in cells that
express the non-degradable IFNAR1 mutant (Figure 7B). These data
collectively suggest that p38 kinase activity-dependent phosphoryla-
tion and the downregulation of IFNAR1 in response to PRR
signaling decrease the extent of cellular responses to Type I IFN.
Intriguingly, LPS was reported to promote the maturation of
human DCs of monocytic origin, a process during which the
downregulation of IFNAR1 and the entire Type I IFN receptor
had been previously reported [4,49,50]. Autocrine/paracrine
Type I IFN produced by DCs not only plays an important role
in their function but also exerts pro-apoptotic effects on DCs
themselves [12,16]. Given that suppression of cell viability elicited
by some of Type I IFN species are most prominent in cells that
express high levels of receptor chains [51], it is plausible that
IFNAR1 downregulation may help DCs to survive under exposure
to their own IFNa/b. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the
viability of mouse bone marrow-derived DCs activated by LPS.
Treatment with a p38 kinase inhibitor significantly decreased the
viability of these cells (Figures 7C). Remarkably, this effect was less
evident in DCs that were either derived from IFNAR1-null mice
(Figure 7C) or treated with the IFNAR1-neutralizing antibody
(Figure 7D) indicating that the activation of p38 kinase may be
important for protecting DCs from detrimental effects of Type I
IFN. Furthermore, whereas the percent of viable LPS-activated
BMDC from the IFNAR1S526A
knock-in mice was relatively low
(10.762.0%), it could be noticeably increased by incubating these
cells with the IFNAR1-neutralizing antibody (20.363.4%,
p,0.01). Similar data were obtained when Annexin V-negative
CD11c-expressing cells were analyzed (Figure S2). Taken
together, these data suggest that PRR-stimulated p38 kinase-
dependent degradation of IFNAR1 results in protection of
activated DCs from the detrimental effects of autocrine/paracrine
IFNa/b.
Discussion
We have previously reported that the induction of UPR
activates a ligand/JAK-independent signaling pathway that leads
to phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IFNAR1.
This signaling involves stimulation of PERK-dependent priming
phosphorylation of IFNAR1 followed by its degron phosphoryla-
tion by CK1a. This pathway, which can be activated in response
to VSV or HCV infection, plays an important role in regulating
the levels of IFNAR1 in naı¨ve cells and in determining the
sensitivity of cells to the future exposure to Type I IFN
[29,33,34,35].
In the present study, we investigated whether HSV infection also
negatively affects IFNAR1 stability and signaling. We found that
ligand/TYK2-independent phosphorylation and downregulation of
IFNAR1 can indeed be observed in cells infected with HSV
(Figure 1). Similar to VSV [35], HSV infection induced the priming
phosphorylation of IFNAR1; and this phosphorylation was required
for IFNAR1 ubiquitination and downregulation (Figure 2). How-
ever, when we next investigated the role of PERK in these processes,
the differences between HSV and VSV became apparent. Unlike
VSV, HSV infection caused little (if any) increase in the
phosphorylation of the major PERK substrate, translational
regulator eIF2a (Figure 3A). Although available literature suggests
that some of this effect could be attributed to the action of
phosphatases directed by the HSV protein c134.5 [40], our studies
together with another report [41] indicated a deficient activation of
PERK in cells infected by HSV (Figures 3B–C). Furthermore,
genetic experiments using PERK knockdown in human cells and
PERK knockout in mouse cells clearly demonstrated that PERK is
dispensable for IFNAR1 phosphorylation and downregulation by
HSV (Figure 3C–D). Given that high doses of inactivated HSV also
stimulated IFNAR1 phosphorylation, downregulation, and degra-
dation (Figure 4), we proposed that there is a novel branch of the
ligand-independent pathway. We hypothesized that this signaling
branch could be induced by pathogen recognition receptors.
Once this initial hypothesis received support from experiments
that used canonical selective activators of PRR signaling (Figure 5),
we changed the focus of our study to follow the effects of this
signaling. Accordingly, we modified the experimental design and
switched to using these canonical activators (due to their
commercial availability and better reproducibility over prepara-
tions of inactivated virus) and to cell models that specifically
reflected the function of pathogenic patterns recognition and
ensuing reactions of innate immunity. Our subsequent studies
demonstrated that, even in the absence of viral infection, the
activation of PRR signaling robustly induces priming phosphor-
ylation and the degradation of IFNAR1 in a manner that requires
the activation of p38 kinase (Figures 5–6). Furthermore, p38
kinase-dependent phosphorylation of IFNAR1 leads to IFNAR1
degradation and, accordingly, tempers the responses of cells to
their future encounters to IFNa/b (Figures 6–7).
The role of the p38 kinase in these processes is intriguing. On
one hand, the results of pharmacologic (Figure 5D) and genetic
AGF mutant) as indicated. Cells were either left untreated or treated with UV-inactivated HSV (MOI 5 for 90 min). p38a kinase was
immunoprecipitated from the lysates with anti-Flag, and the immunoprecipitates were subject to an in vitro kinase assay using GST-IFNAR1 (‘‘GST-
R1’’, WT, or S532A mutant) as substrates and monitored using the pS532 antibody (top panel). The amounts of GST-IFNAR1 and p38 in the IP
reactions are shown. (D) U937 cells that received control shRNA or shRNA against p38a kinase were treated with LPS (10 mg/mL for 1 h) and
harvested. The phosphorylation and levels of IFNAR1 were analyzed by IP-IB. The levels of p38a kinase in the whole cell lysates are also shown. (E)
U937 cells were untreated or pre-treated with the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 (10 mM for 1 h) and then with either LPS (10 mg/mL for 1 h) or

was analyzed. (F) Cycloheximide chase analysis of endogenous IFNAR1 in U937 cells treated as in panel E was analyzed using the indicated

(Figure 6D) studies implicate p38 kinase in the PRR-induced
downregulation of IFNAR1. Furthermore, our biochemical data
suggest that p38 kinase is capable of directly phosphorylating the
priming site on IFNAR1 in vitro (Figure 4A–C). However, given a
known preference of this kinase for proline-directed Ser and Thr
residues as phospho-acceptor sites [52] and the fact that the
priming site on IFNAR1 does not conform to these criteria, it is
plausible that the direct phosphorylation of Ser532 in cells might
be carried out by a SB203580-sensitive kinase that associates with
p38 kinase and depends on p38 activation.
On another hand, p38 kinase can be also activated by Type I
IFN in several types of cells [53,54,55]. In fact, within cells that
have already encountered it, IFNa/b, p38 kinase activity is proven
to contribute to the maximal extent of the IFN-induced
transcriptional program [10,56,57]. Yet it appears that the
ligand-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IFNAR1 does
not depend on p38 kinase activity (Figure 6E–F). Indeed, our
recent study identified protein kinase D2 as a key TYK2-
dependent IFN-inducible kinase that mediates the ligand-stimu-
lated IFNAR1 phosphorylation, ubiquitination, endocytosis and
degradation [28]. Furthermore, it appears that the activation of
p38 kinase in cells that have not been yet exposed to IFNa/b may
temper future sensitivity to these cytokines through an elimination
of the receptor (Figure 7E).
Collectively, these studies describe a novel link between an
activation of innate immune responses that usually govern
production of Type I IFN, with modulation of the extent of
cellular responses elicited by these cytokines (Figure 7E). It is
plausible that the temporal downregulation of IFNAR1 that
precedes or coincides with the peak of IFNa/b synthesis could be
important for various aspects of the host defenses. These aspects
may include the maintenance of the viability of IFN-producing
cells, limiting the extent of IFNa/b pathway, and affecting the
sensitivity of the host to the secondary infection.
Among cell types capable of producing IFNa/b, the dendritic
cells (DCs) are distinguished with an advanced ability to recognize
a variety of pathogenic patterns and, upon this activation,
synthesize and secrete Type I IFNs and other cytokines that
participate in shaping the immune responses [6,58]. Activated
DCs that produce IFNa/b have to be protected from the
detrimental effects of autocrine IFN [4,12,16]. Indeed, it has been
shown that activated DCs are prone to apoptosis, the extent of
which is decreased in cells from IFNAR1-null animals [12,16]. It
has also been demonstrated that, upon their maturation, DCs
downregulate Type I IFN receptor [49,50] though the mechanism
underlying this downregulation or its role in DC maturation and
survival remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that PRR-
stimulated p38 kinase-dependent degradation of IFNAR1 leads to
an attenuation of Type I IFN signaling and ameliorates its
negative effects in DCs (Figure 7). These data suggest that the
activation of the signaling pathway that involves phosphorylation
and degradation of IFNAR1 may render DCs (and perhaps other
IFNa/b-producing cells) refractory to their own Type I IFN.
As indicated by our data (presented in Figure 7), such
refractoriness may improve the viability of DCs. In addition, the
mechanism described here may plausibly contribute to discon-
tinuing an otherwise potentially harmful cycle of DCs being
activated by Type I IFN followed by the production of more of
these cytokines and a subsequent greater activation of DCs. Given
the well documented role of IFNa/b in the pathogenesis of
autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus,
psoriasis, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus [17,18,19,20]), temporal
downregulation of IFNAR1 might play an important role in
protecting the host from such autoimmune reactions.
Whereas the latter outcomes of IFNAR1 degradation stimulated
by signaling induced by pathogenic patterns may benefit the host,
it could also decrease the ability of some cell types exposed to PRR
inducers to mount an appropriate anti-viral response. It remains to
be seen whether the suppression of Type I IFN signaling by
chronic exposure to other pathogens in other cell types may play a
role in the development of secondary viral infections, which have
been linked to insufficient IFNa/b function [59]. Future studies in
vivo aimed at a further delineation of the mechanisms of IFNAR1
degradation and its role in sensitivity to secondary infections and
autoimmune disorders are consequently warranted.
Materials and Methods
Plasmids and reagents
Recombinant GST-p38a was purchased (Cell Signaling).
Vectors for bacterial expression of GST-IFNAR1 and mammalian
expression of human and murine Flag-IFNAR1 were described
previously [25,33,35]. The plasmids for expression of Flag-p38
(wild type or catalytically inactive AGF) were a generous gift from
R. J. Davis. ShRNA constructs for knocking down p38a kinase
were from Sigma. Constructs for knock down of PERK were
previously described [33]. Recombinant human IFNa2 (Roferon)
was from Roche. Recombinant murine IFNb and mouse IFNa/b
neutralizing antibodies were from PBL. LPS, poly IC, MDP and
CpG were from InVivogen. Neutralizing antibody against mouse
IFNAR1 (MAR) was from Leinco. P38 inhibitor SB203580 and
JNK inhibitor SP600125 were from EMD Biosciences. P38
inhibitor VX-702 was from ChemTek. CK1 inhibitor D4476
was from Tocris. All other reagents were from Sigma.
Viruses
VSV (Indiana serotype, a gift from R. Harty) and HSV-1 (KOS
strain, a gift from G. Cohen and R. Eisenberg) were propagated in
HeLa cells. These cells were also used to determine the viral titers
in serially diluted stocks using methylcellulose method. In
experiments requiring inactivated virus, virus suspension was
placed in Petri dishes and exposed either to UV-C light (254 nm)
for 5 min to achieve the total dose of 1500 J/m2
or sham treated
for the same time period.
Cells and gene delivery
Human monocytic U937 and HeLa cells were from ATTC.
Replication-deficient lentiviral particles encoding shRNA against
GFP (shCON), PERK, p38, or the empty virus control were
prepared via co-transfecting 293T cells with three other helper
vectors as described previously [33,35]. Viral supernatants were
denotes p,0.05 in the t-test. (E) Depicted is a hypothetical model that reflects a dual mode of regulation of the IFNa/b responses by PRR signaling
(gray blunt arrows represent the inhibitory effects). The ligand-inducible pathway (that involves activation of TYK2 and PKD2) limits the extent of
IFNa/b signaling in a cell that has been already exposed to these cytokines. Conversely, the ligand/JAK-independent pathway may (that involves
PERK-dependent or independent activation of p38 kinase, priming phosphorylation and ensuing phosphorylation of IFNAR1 degron by CK1a) render
a naı¨ve cell less sensitive to its future encounters with Type I IFNs. The activation of PRR both induces production of endogenous Type I IFN and
downregulates IFNAR1 in the very same IFN-producing cells. This mechanism may support the viability of the IFN-producing cells and temper an
overall activity of IFNa/b pathways.
