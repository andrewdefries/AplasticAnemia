Summary Mice bearing progressively growing syngeneic methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas are
immunologically hyporeactive. However, both basal (steady-state) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-
induced synthesis of mRNA for interleukin-1 (IL-1) in peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) or spleen cells were
comparable in control and tumour-bearing animals. Furthermore, the production of IL-1 by PEC stimulated
with LPS in the presence of indomethacin was same in control and tumour-bearing mice. The results thus
demonstrate that LPS-stimulated cells from animals bearing progressively growing syngeneic sarcomas syn-
thesise the same quantities of mRNA for IL-I and produce comparable amounts of IL-I as do cells from
normal animals, in spite of the profound immunological hyporeactivity of the former.
Animals or humans bearing progressively growing syngeneic
tumours show a decrease in immunological responsiveness
(North, 1985). The defects affect various components of the
immune system including synthesis and production of lym-
phokines and cytokines. It has been demonstrated in various
model systems that tumour bearers have impaired production
of interleukin-1 (IL-1) (Pollack et al., 1983; Herman et al.,
1984; Santos et al., 1985; Economon et al., 1988; Garraud et
al., 1988).
IL-1 is thought to play a central role in host defence by
virtue of its ability to augment the replication of activated T
lymphocytes and to mediate several aspects of inflammation
(Durum et al., 1985). Since the direct cytostatic (Gaffney &
Tsai, 1986) or cytotoxic (Onozaki et al., 1985; Lachman et
al., 1986) effects of IL-1 on tumour cells have been described,
attempts with varying degrees of success to treat cancers with
exogenous IL-1 have been reported (Nakamura et al., 1986;
Braunschweiger et al., 1988; Bubenik et al., 1988; Castelli et
al., 1988; Nakata et al., 1988; North et al., 1988).
Here we show, however, that both normal and
immunologically hyporeactive mice bearing progressively
growing syngeneic tumours synthesise comparable levels of
mRNA for IL-1. They also produce similar amounts of IL-1,
but the biological effects of IL-1 produced by tumour-bearing
animals are masked by indomethacin-sensitive immunosupp-
ressive molecules.
Materials and methods
Animals
Male mice of the inbred strain C57BL/lOSn (here after called
BlO) from the breeding colony of our Institute were used in
all experiments.
Tumours
Sarcoma MC 11 originally induced by methylcholanthrene in
a BlO male (Bubenik et al., 1978) was used. Tumour cells
were grown in tissue cultures in Eagle's minimal essential
medium supplemented with antibiotics, glutamine and 10%
fetal calf serum. To induce tumours, 1 x 10' MC 11 cells in a
volume of 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were injected
subcutaneously into 7-8-week-old B1O mice. When the
tumours reached a size of approximately 2 cm2 (roughly 3
weeks after cell inoculation), the animals were killed and
used as donors of cells.
Mitogen stimulation
Spleen cells were stimulated with mitogens as described
elsewhere (Hol'asn et al., 1985). In brief, 2 x 10' cells per well
in 96-well tissue culture plates (Sterilin Ltd, Feltham, UK)
were stimulated with 5 lAg ml-' concanavalin A (Con A,
Sigma Chemical Co., St Louis, MO, USA) or 40 g ml1'
bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Difco Laboratories,
Detroit, MI, USA) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with antibiotics, glutamine, 5 x 10-' M 2-mercaptoethanol,
10 mM HEPES bufer and 10% fetal calf serum (complete
RPMI 1640 medium). Cell proliferation was determined by
adding 'H-thymidine (I JLCi ml-') for the last 6 h of a 72-h
incubation period.
Thymocyte co-stimulatory assay
Biological activity of IL-1 was tested in the thymocyte assay
(Mizel et al., 1983). Thymocytes (5 x 10' per well) from
4-week-old B1O mice in 0.2 ml of complete RPMI 1640
medium were stimulated with Con A (2 ig ml'). Several
dilutions of supernatants to be tested for IL-I activity were
added to the wells. Cell proliferation was determined by
adding 3H-thymidine (I piCi ml-') for the last 6 h of the 72 h
incubation period.
IL-I production
Unstimulated peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from individual
control and tumour-bearing mice were adjusted to a concent-
ration of 2 x 106 ml' and cultured in 0.2 ml of complete
RPMI 1640 medium in 96-well tissue culture plates (Sterilin).
The cells were cultured alone, or with addition of 20 fig ml
LPS (Difco) or 10-' M indomethacin (Sigma Chemical Co.,
St Louis, MO, USA) and/or in the presence of LPS and
indomethacin. After 24h of culture the supernatants were
collected and tested in the thymocyte assay.
Northern blot analysis
Total RNA was prepared from 2 x 107 spleen cells or PEC
from control or tumour-bearing mice. The cells were freshly
taken from animals or were incubated for 24 h unstimulated
or were stimulated for the last 8 h of the 24 h incubation
period with 20 pg ml-' LPS (Difco). Because the cells could
transiently express some IL-1 mRNA upon isolation (Koide
& Steinman, 1987), they were pre-incubated for 16 h before
stimulation. RNA was extracted using the guanidine
isothiocyanate method (Chirgwin et al., 1979) and subjected
(30 jg per lane) to electrophoresis in 1% agarose, blotted on
to Hybond N nitrocellulose membranes (Maniatis et al.,
1982) and hybridised with a "2P-labelled IL-la probe

of hybridization described elsewhere (Lipoldovia et al., 1989).
The IL-la probe was a kind gift from Dr P.T. Lomedico
(Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ, USA). Membranes
were exposed at -70°C to Kodak XAR-5 film. The blots
were then stripped and rehybridised with a cDNA probe for
actin to demonstrate comparable quantities of RNAs in indi-
vidual lanes.
Results
Hyporeactivity ofspleen cellsfrom tumour-bearing mice
Spleen cells from mice bearing progressively growing MC 11
sarcomas were significantly hyporeactive (P<0.001 by
Student's t test) in proliferative responses to both T-cell (Con
A) and B-cell (LPS) mitogens (Figure 1).
Synthesis ofIL-la mRNA in spleen cells
No difference between quantities of IL-1 mRNA in cells from
control and tumour-bearing mice was found when the activa-
tion of spleen cells from tumour-bearing mice was tested at
the level of expression of the gene for IL-la. The LPS-
stimulated spleen cells from tumour-bearing mice produced a
level of IL-la mRNA comparable to that observed in cells
from control mice (Figure 2). When the basal (steady-state)
synthesis of mRNA for IL-la was tested in freshly isolated
and in cultured unstimulated spleen cells, no difference
between cells from control and tumour-bearing animals was
observed (Figures 3 and 4).

Production ofIL-I by PEC
Unstimulated PEC from both control and tumour-bearing
mice did not produce any amounts of IL-1 measurable in the
thymocyte assay. Nor was any biological activity of IL-1
detected in the supernatants obtained from cultures of LPS-
stimulated PEC from tumour-bearing mice and only low
titres of IL-1 were found in supernatants from LPS-
stimulated PEC from control animals (data not shown).
Since the biological activity of IL-1 could be masked by
prostaglandins produced by macrophages, we next tested the
production of IL-1 in the presence of 10-5 M indomethacin.

bearing mice stimulated with LPS in the presence of an

The cells of MC 11 tumour have never been detected in
spleen or peritoneum of mice bearing subcutaneously grow-
ing tumours. Therefore, the possibility of IL-1 and/or pros-
taglandin production by MC 11 cells in vitro can be
excluded.

and tumour-bearing mice. PEC were washed out from groups of
20 control or tumour-bearing B10 mice and were cultured for 8 h
unstimulated or stimulated with LPS (201agml-'). Total RNA
was isolated and hybridised with IL-la probe and after stripping

1 and 3) or tumour-bearing (lanes 2 and 4) mice. Position of

inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis (indomethacin), pro-
duced significant and comparable titres of IL-1.
Indomethacin alone did not stimulate detectable IL-I activity
in PEC from control or tumour-bearing mice (data not
shown).
Progressive growth of syngeneic tumour is generally
associated with gradual decrease of immunological respon-
siveness in the host. We show here that this tumour-induced
hyporeactivity is not associated with reduced production of
IL-1. Mice bearing methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas
synthesised the same amount of mRNA for IL-1 and pro-
duced comparable amounts of IL-I as normal animals.
There are, however, a number of papers demonstrating
impaired production of IL-1 in tumour bearers (Pollack et
al., 1983; Herman et al., 1984; Santos et al., 1985; Economon
et al., 1988; Garraud et al., 1988). The IL-I production had
been detected by bioassays. Using these tests we detected no
IL-1 also in the supernatants from LPS-stimulated PEC from
our tumour-bearing mice. Only in the presence of
indomethacin, a potent inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis,
could the production of IL-1 by tumour bearers be detected.
The finding thus shows that immmunologically hyporeactive
tumour-bearing mice have a potential to produce a normal
level of IL-1, but the production and/or activity of IL-1 are
masked by higher production of prostaglandins. The
immunosuppressive effects of prostaglandins have been dem-
onstrated (Goodwin & Ceuppens, 1983) and the synthesis of
prostaglandins has been considered as one of the mechanisms
of action of non-specific suppressor cells present in tumour
bearers (Young & Hoover, 1986; Parhar & Lala, 1988). Also
in our model of methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas in the
mouse we observed that spleen cells from tumour-bearing
animals inhibited the mitogen-induced proliferation of cells
from normal donors (our unpublished results). These obser-

vations indicate that the suppressor mechanism in tumour
bearers does not irreversibly inhibit IL-1 production since
mitogen-stimulated cells from tumour bearers produce IL-1
in vitro as well as do cells from normal animals.
IL-1 is a cytokine that has a number of biological func-
tions in the body and that is produced by different cells
(Durum et al., 1985). Although impaired produciton of IL-1
has been described in various immunopathological situations,
such as bacterial infections (Czuprynski & Brown, 1987),
aplastic anaemia (Gascon & Scala, 1988) and tumour growth
(Nakamura et al., 1986; North et al., 1988), the possibility
cannot be excluded that the biological effects of IL-1, when
tested in an attempt to detect IL-I, were masked by
immunosuppressive molecules produced by the
immunologically compromised subjects.
The results reported here show that LPS-stimulated cells
from immunologically hyporeactive mice bearing syngeneic,
progressively growing tumours synthesise IL-1 to the same
extent as do cells from normal animals. The lower produc-
tion of IL-1 by tumour bearers or by other immunologically
compromised subjects, as had been generally demonstrated
by the bioassays, could be due to the presence of
indomethacin-sensitive immunosuppressive molecules.
Indeed, the therapeutic anti-tumour effects of IL-1 have been
augmented by indomethacin (Nakata et al., 1988).

assistance of Mrs Eva Fortovi is also appreciated.
