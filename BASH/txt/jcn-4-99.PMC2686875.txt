Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can adversely affect cognitive function by suppressing neuronal
excitability or enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission. The main cognitive effects of AEDs are
impaired attention, vigilance, and psychomotor speed, but secondary effects can manifest on
other cognitive functions. Although the long-term use of AEDs can obviously elicit cognitive
dysfunction in epilepsy patients, their cognitive effects over short periods of up to a year are in-
conclusive due to methodological problems. In general, the effects on cognition are worse for
older AEDs (e.g., phenobarbital) than for placebo, nondrug condition, and newer AEDs. However,
topiramate is the newer AED that has the greatest risk cognitive impairment irrespective of the
comparator group. Since the cognitive impact of AEDs can be serious, clinicians should be
alert to adverse events by evaluating cognitive function using screening tests. Adverse cog-
nitive events of AEDs can be avoided by slow titration to the lowest effective dosage and by
avoiding polytherapy. J Clin Neurol 2008;4:99-106

Introduction
Patients with epilepsy often experience cognitive dysfunc-
tion. Multiple factors can adversely affect cognition in epilepsy,
including the etiology of the seizures, cerebral lesions acquired
before the onset of seizures, seizure type, age at onset of epi-
lepsy, seizure frequency, duration, and severity, intraictal and
interictal physiologic dysfunction, structural cerebral damage
caused by repetitive or prolonged seizures, hereditary factors,
psychosocial factors, and sequelae of treatment for epilepsy,
including antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and epilepsy surgery.1-6
All these interrelated factors make complex contributions to
cognitive deficits.5
AEDs affect cognition by suppressing neu-
ronal excitability or enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission.
Patients, and even some clinicians, tend to blame cognitive
problems on AEDs because they are more identifiable than
other factors. However, AED effects should not be overrated.
Psychosocial problems, which are common, can be overlo-
oked as a source of cognitive impairment. The stigma of epi-
lepsy and the fear of having seizures in public can lead to low
self-esteem, social isolation, and depression, all of which can
negative affect cognitive function. Similarly, subclinical epi-
leptiform activity is another important contributor to cognitive
dysfunction that can go unrecognized, especially in patients
with infrequent seizures.
Whilst AEDs are rarely the sole source of cognitive defi-
cits, they do have the potential to affect cognition significantly
in certain patients. AEDs exert dosage-dependent effects on
cognitive functioning, which can be exacerbated by AED
polytherapy. The main cognitive effects of AEDs involve at-
tention/vigilance, psychomotor speed, and secondary invol-
vement of other cognitive functions (e.g., memory).4
The
effects of AEDs on cognition are especially significant since
AEDs are often be selected based on both traditional meas-
ures of treatment effectiveness such as efficacy and tolera-
bility, and their negative neuropsychological side effects.
The presence of AED-induced cognitive side effects is an
important concern of epilepsy patients taking medications.7
Consequently, the neuropsychologist should attempt to deter-
mine the potential effects of AEDs on cognitive performance,
as well as the patient’s subjective perception of performance,
which can also be mediated by the mood and affective state.6
The magnitude of AED-related cognitive dysfunction is gen-
erally modest in monotherapy and when the AED is present
at therapeutic serum concentrations. However, there are cir-
cumstances in which decreased cognitive function assumes
greater importance, such as learning in school children,5,8
when driving or operating machinery, and when cognitive
Cognitive Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs

skills might be especially vulnerable, such as in the elderly.4
It is especially important to identify and minimize the cogni-
tive effects of AEDs in children, whose developing nervous
systems can be more vulnerable to the long-term consequences
of AED-induced cognitive impairment.9
Individuals older than
65 years are more susceptible to the cognitive effects of AEDs
due to both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic factors.10
Nevertheless, very few studies have specifically examined
the cognitive effects ofAEDs in this population.
Attempts to identify and quantify the cognitive effects of
AEDs have had limited success. Although hundreds of studies
have been performed, their methodological flaws, differences
in study designs, and contradictory results have resulted in no
clear picture emerging. There are three primary factors to con-
sider when assessing the cognitive risk of AEDs, which is a
difficult area in which to perform studies in a largely clinical
setting.6
The first results from failure to randomize the treat-
ment regimen, since patients with epilepsy that is more diffi-
cult to control are more likely to try newer drugs, and hence
have cognitive skills prior to treatment that are not represen-
tative of the population. The second factor is the difficulty of
establishing comparable drug levels, since patients are treated
clinically across a wide range of effective dosages, which
might have varying effects on cognitive function. Third, the
absence of blinding is a concern in many studies. Other me-
thodological issues might also be present. Some studies have
employed healthy volunteers rather than patients in order to
control for the confounding effects of seizures and pre-exi-
sting brain abnormalities. The duration of treatment used in
some crossover studies might be inadequate to determine the
effects of long-term therapy on neuropsychological status, a
concern that is especially relevant to pediatric AED studies
since the cognitive effects occur against the backdrop of nor-
mal cognitive development. Here we review the current liter-
ature on the cognitive effects of AEDs, drawing general conc-
lusions whenever possible whilst taking into account the many
underlying methodological problems.
OlderAEDs
AEDs are often categorized into “older” (developed before
the 1990s) and “newer” (introduced during in the 1990s or
later) agents. Since numerous reviews and clinical data are
available for older AEDs, here only a brief overview of their
cognitive effects is provided. Phenytoin (PHT), carbamaze-
pine (CBZ), valproate (VPA), phenobarbital (PB), and ben-
zodiazepines have been used in epilepsy treatment for many
years, and are categorized as older AEDs. The large Veterans
Administration (VA) Cooperative Study comparing the cog-
nitive effects of CBZ, PB, PHT, and primidone in a parallel
study of patients with new-onset epilepsy found no consistent
pattern across AEDs and little change in cognition after AED
treatment.11
However, the study design did not control adequa-
tely for test-retest effects. The second VA Cooperative Study
found no cognitive differences between CBZ and VPA.12
Another study comparing CBZ and PHT in patients with epi-
lepsy also found modest negative effects on cognition for both
drugs, and few differential effects.13
Randomized, double-
blind crossover studies in healthy volunteers directly compar-
ing AEDs have demonstrated that CBZ, PHT, and VPA have
similar cognitive side effects.14,15
In contrast, PB scored sig-
nificantly worse than PHT or VPA on 32% of the variables.
All of these older AEDs affected cognition relative to the
nondrug conditions, with approximately half of the variables
being significantly worse for CBZ, PHT, and VPA. It was
recently reported that total Intelligence Quotient (IQ) (espe-
cially performance items) improved in children who disconti-
nued PB compared to those who continued to take PB.16
Thus,
among the older AEDs, CBZ, PHT, and VPA exert similar
effects on cognitive function, with PB producing greater cog-
nitive impairment.
NewerAEDs
Many newer AEDs have been introduced since the early
1990s, including felbamate (FBM), gabapentin (GBP), la-
motrigine (LTG), oxcarbazepine (OXC), topiramate (TPM),
tiagabine (TGB), vigabatrin (VGB), zonisamide (ZNS), pre-
gabalin (PGB), and levetiracetam (LEV). Because of serious
safety issues, including aplastic anemia and hepatotoxicity,
FBM therapy is recommended only for epilepsy patients who
are refractory to other AEDs, and its cognitive effects have
not been systematically studied.
Despite the large number of newer agents, most neuropsy-
chological studies have compared newer drugs to older AEDs
with a higher risk of cognitive impairment, or against newer
drugs at dosages that do not reflect current prescribing pat-
terns, making the comparative effects of newer agents unclear.6
Since these methodologies might be unduly influenced by
the pharmaceutical companies that financially support cogni-
tive studies, direct head-to-head comparative studies of newer
drugs will probably require government support.
Gabapentin (Neurontin®
)
GBP has a novel mode of action, which is thought to invo-
lve potentiation of GABA-mediated inhibition and possibly
inactivation of sodium channels. GBP has few side effects on
the central nervous system (CNS), even at relatively high
dosages or with rapid dosage escalation,17
and exerts few ad-
verse cognitive effects. A study of patients with partial epilep-
Park SP and Kwon SH
www.thejcn.com 101
sy added double-blind placebo or GBP to a stable baseline of
one or two other AEDs.18
Patients were treated for 3 months
at increasing dosages (up to 2,400 mg/day) and were then
crossed over to the alternative therapy. None of the cognitive
measures differed significantly between GBP and placebo. A
longer term healthy volunteer study comparing GBP with CBZ
with a randomized double-blind crossover design found that
performance was better with GBP than with CBZ in 8 of the
31 neuropsychological measures assessed.19
Another study
found no differences between CBZ and GBP in brief neuro-
psychological tests or in quantitative electroencephalogram
(EEG) in healthy volunteers.20
The use of GBP as an add-on
treatment in patients on established AED treatments improved
the performance in 1 of 10 cognitive measures.21
Thus, multi-
ple studies involving patients and healthy volunteers suggest
that the cognitive effects of GBP are modest, and generally
less than those associated with CBZ.
Lamotrigine (Lamictal®
)
LTG appears to act by stabilizing sodium channels and
reducing glutamate. One study found that the neuropsycho-
logical outcome was better for LTG than for CBZ in more
than half of the neuropsychological measures assessed in
healthy volunteers.22
The superiority of LTG over older AEDs
has been demonstrated in studies involving healthy volun-
teers.23-25
Similar neuropsychological findings have been
obtained in patient studies, with add-on treatments producing
no incremental impairment noted compared to placebo.26,27
The results of a computerized battery of cognitive tests in
children did not differ significantly between LTG and pla-
cebo.28
Moreover, LTG and VPA produced the same results
in adult epilepsy patients.29
Both of these AEDs improve the
performance of list learning and in the Trail-Making Test.
The results were also the same for LTG and OXC in adult
epilepsy patients.30
The available data appear to indicate that
the neuropsychological performance in both adults and child-
ren with epilepsy improves after LTG treatment.
Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal®
)
OXC is a novel AED that is chemically related to CBZ
and is approved as an initial or add-on treatment for partial
seizures. Three studies have evaluated the cognitive effects
of OXC in adult epilepsy patients.31-33
In the first study, new-
ly diagnosed patients received OXC or other AEDs as a mo-
notherapy for 4 months.31
Compared with baseline, OXC-tre-
ated patients improved in 1 of 20 cognitive tasks and worsened
in none, and the results were similar in patients receiving CBZ,
VPA, PB, or PHT monotherapy. The second study had a dou-
ble-blind design, and found no differences between OXC and
PHT monotherapy in newly diagnosed patients in any of the
seven cognitive variables measured at any time point.32
The
third study used neuropsychological tests and event-related
potentials, and found that 1 year of OXC monotherapy had no
negative effects on cognition.33
However, OXC induced mild
cognitive impairment accompanied by slight EEG slowing in
healthy volunteers, although the magnitude of the effect of
OXC was smaller than that observed with PHT.34
In children
with newly diagnosed partial epilepsy, no difference between
OXC and CBZ, VPA, or combined CBZ/VPA polytherapy in
various standard neuropsychological measures and specia-
lized computerized tasks was found during a 6-month follow-
up.35,36
In summary, OXC does not appear to afford significant
cognitive benefit in adults and children with epilepsy com-
pared to traditionalAEDs.
Topiramate (Topamax®
)
TPM is a broad-spectrum AED that has multiple mecha-
nisms of action, including blockade of voltage-dependent so-
dium channels, potentiation of GABA-mediated effects, car-
bonic anhydrase inhibition, and glutamate antagonism. TPM
is the newer AED that generates the greatest concern over its
potential negative neuropsychological effects, which include
decreased function in language and frontal execution.37-39
TPM
can induce somnolence, mental slowing, memory deficit, and
language problems in clinical trials. Head-to-head compara-
tive studies have found that neuropsychological impairments
are greater for TPM (at 300-400 mg/day) than for LTG, VPA,
GBP, and TGB in both epilepsy patients and healthy volunte-
ers.40-44
Importantly, some individuals are disproportionately
sensitive to TPM, although the ability to predict this does not
presently exist.41
In a monotherapy comparative trial in adult
epilepsy patients, the effect on cognition was worse even
for TPM at 87 mg/day than for OXC at 825 mg/day.45
The cognitive risk of TPM increases with the dosage. Across
various cognitive measures there appears to be a strong rela-
tionship between the risk of cognitive impairment and the
total daily dose. A prospective study in adult epilepsy patients
found that 1 year of TPM monotherapy at 89 mg/day induced
cognitive impairment.46
The cognitive effects of TPM were
dosage-dependent, and prominent for dosages higher than 75
mg/day. Very similar results were obtained in a short-term
prospective study of TPM prophylaxis for migraine.47
Dosage-
related cognitive deficits of TPM monotherapy have also
been demonstrated in children with epilepsy. Although the
cognitive effects were more harmful for TPM than for CBZ
in children with benign rolandic epilepsy, the outcome with
the minimum target dosage did not differ significantly be-
tween the treatment groups.48
In conclusion, although most
patients will tolerate TPM, certain situations are associated
with clinically significant adverse cognitive events. The factors
Cognitive Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs

affecting these events include titration rate, maintenance time,
dosage, use of polytherapy, and individual susceptibility.
Tiagabine (Gabatril®
)
TGB is a GABA-reuptake inhibitor that is used to treat
partial epilepsy. Despite being introduced into Europe in
1995, it is not yet available in Korea. A parallel-group, add-
on, randomized, double-blind dosage-response study in epilep-
sy patients did not reveal any significant cognitive or beha-
vioral effects of TGB.49
In a monotherapy study in newly treat-
ed epilepsy patients treated for 52 weeks, the effect of TGB
was comparable to that of CBZ, except for CBZ being more
harmful to verbal fluency.50
Thus, the cognitive effects of TGB
appear modest, and generally comparable to those of CBZ.
Vigabatrin (Sabril®
)
VGB is a structural analogue of GABA that irreversibly
inhibits the degradative enzyme GABA-transaminase, which
increases brain GABA levels. Its use in epilepsy treatment is
limited due to evidence of visual field constriction as a side
effect. Compared to placebo, VGB produced few adverse ef-
fects on either cognitive or quality-of-life measures in patients
with epilepsy in a double-blind, randomized, add-on study.51
VGB also produced fewer adverse events than CBZ in a small,
open-label, randomized, parallel-group patient study.52
There-
fore, VGB does not appear to exert negative effects on cognition.
Zonisamide (Exegran®
)
ZNS was introduced into the South Korean market in 1992,
and approved as a mono- and adjunctive therapy in treating
partial and generalized epilepsy. It works by blocking the
presynaptic voltage-sensitive sodium and calcium channels in
neurons, or increasing cortical GABA concentrations, and
also mildly inhibiting carbonic anhydrase. Two preliminary
studies found that ZNS appeared to affect cognitive functions
such as attention, memory, and language function when it
was used for 12 to 24 weeks.53,54
The worse cognitive perfor-
mance at 12 weeks of medication tended to improve at 24
weeks of medication.53
However, a significant proportion of epilepsy patients who
took ZNS as a monotherapy complained of memory loss
(35%) and attention deficit (27%) even after 6 months of
therapy,55
which might indicate the intolerable cognitive dys-
function is induced by long-term ZNS treatment. A pros-
pective, randomized, open-label study recently clarified the
long-term cognitive effects of ZNS monotherapy in epilepsy
patients.56
Despite 1 year of ZNS treatment decreasing the
seizure frequency and EEG abnormalities, several cognitive
tests also revealed negative effects. The poor performance
might have been related to the dosage, especially those high-
er than 300 mg/day. In summary, the few related studies sug-
gest that ZNS exerts harmful effects on cognition.
Pregabalin (Lyrica®
)
PGB was introduced into the South Korean market in 2006,
and approved as an add-on therapy for partial onset seizure.
PGB binds to the alpha2-delta (A2D) receptors of voltage-
gated calcium channels in CNS tissues, and thereby inhibits
calcium influx and the release of glutamate, norepinephrine,
substance P, and other neurotransmitters. A randomized double-
blind three-period crossover study administering 450 mg/day
PGB to healthy volunteers found no significant effects on the
objective measures of reaction time, vigilance, and short-term
memory, although it was associated with subjective sedation,
critical flicker fusion, and divided attention.57
In a short-term
comparative add-on trial in adult patients with refractory par-
tial epilepsy, add-on PGB induced partly significant impair-
ments in the episodic memory of verbal and visual information,
whereas add-on LEV improved visual short-term memory
performance.58
The negative neuropsychological effects of
PGB are thought to be temporary under titration. In summary,
the few related studies suggest that the cognitive effects of
PGB are modest, and greater than those associated with LEV.
Levetiracetam (Keppra®
)
LEV was introduced into the South Korean market in 2007,
and approved as a monotherapy and add-on therapy for par-
tial onset seizure. Recently, it began to be approved as add-
on therapy for generalized seizure. The mechanism of action
of LEV is unique, putatively involving modulation of the
functions of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A, which is its
binding site. A healthy-volunteer study found that cognitive
deficits were less for LEV than for CBZ.59
Significant differ-
ences were present for 42% (23 of 55) of the investigated
measures, all favoring LEV. Compared to the nondrug average,
the effects of CBZ were worse in 65% (36 of 55) of the in-
vestigated measures, and those of LEV were worse in 12%
(4 of 33). An observational study found that there was no
change in cognitive functioning between patients being treated
with LEV and TPM after AED titration.60
Thus, data from
both healthy volunteers and patients suggest that LEV exerts
few adverse effects on cognition.
How to Minimize theAdverse
Cognitive Events
The ideal AED would reduce neuronal irritability without
affecting neuronal excitability and cognitive function. The
following techniques are used to reduce the cognitive side
effects of AEDs: treat underlying disease processes, titrate
Park SP and Kwon SH

slowly when initiating AEDs, use the lowest AED dosage
possible, use AED monotherapy if possible, avoid AEDs with
greater adverse events (e.g., PB), avoid adverse pharmaco-
kinetic interactions, balance all factors with best seizure con-
trol, and confirm the seizure diagnosis if the patient is re-
fractory to AEDs. Some patients are best controlled (with the
least side effects) on low-dosage, addictive polytherapy.
Conclusions
Patients with epilepsy often experience cognitive dysfunc-
tion. An AED treatment can affect cognition either positively
or negatively. Since greater seizure frequency, duration, and
severity increase the likelihood of impaired cognition, AED
intake can reduce cognitive dysfunction by controlling sei-
zures. However, even though the cognitive effects of AEDs
are usually modest when these agents are used as a mono-
therapy at blood concentrations within the standard thera-
peutic ranges, significant effects such as decreased quality of
life or neuropsychological impairment can occur. Furthermore,
intolerance of long-term AED-induced cognitive dysfunction

will have longer lasting harmful effects on the quality of life.
Our epilepsy clinic investigated cognition using neuropsy-
chological tests in patients with well-controlled epilepsy tre-
ated with AEDs for at least 1 year to determine whether cog-
nitive deficits were induced by the long-term use of AEDs.
We selected 48 patients who had been seizure-free for more
than 1 year, normal EEG in neuropsychological tests, and
normal MRI in order to exclude cognitive effects of interictal
epileptiform discharges or structural brain lesions. Our patie-
nts were exposed to AEDs for a mean of 5.8 years (range:
1-30 years) and had a mean seizure-free period of 3 years
(range: 1-9 years). Ninety percent of them received mono-
therapy at the usual dosages, being treated with older or newer
AEDs as follows: VPA (n=16), LTG (n=12), OXC (n=7),
TPM (n=6), CBZ (n=4), ZNS (n=4), PHT (n=1), Clona-
zopam (n=1), and PGN (n=1). We compared cognitive
measures in these patients with those of 48 age- and educati-
onmatched healthy controls. As indicated in Table 1, the IQ
and mood status were normal in both of the epilepsy patients
and controls, but the working memory, executive function,
and verbal fluency were worse in the patients. The perfor-
mances of learning and memory tests did not differ between
the two groups. These cognitive deficits were not correlated
with patient characteristics, epilepsy variables, or type of AEDs.
Interestingly, the verbal-fluency performance was well cor-
related with the AED treatment duration (r=-0.304, p=
0.035). Executive dysfunction is a common cognitive side ef-
fect of AEDs, and we concluded that any AED can elicit cog-
nitive impairment when it is used for a sufficiently long time.
It is clear that the long-term use of AEDs can elicit cogni-
tive dysfunction in epilepsy patients, but the short-term cog-
nitive effects of AEDs (for periods of up to a year) are not
conclusive from recent studies. We attempted to summarize
the current literature and draw general conclusions despite
previous cognitive studies exhibiting many methodological
problems. Table 2 summarizes the cognitive effects of AEDs
obtained by searching MEDLINE up to January 2008. In gen-
eral, comparisons of mean data across groups revealed that
cognitive performances are worse for older AEDs than for
placebo or a nondrug condition. However, comparisons of
older AEDs reveal few differences, with only PB showing
some consistency in a trend for inferior performance com-
pared to other AEDs. Data availability is worse for newer
AEDs than for older AEDs. In general, it appears that newer
AEDs performed more favorably compared with placebo or
nondrug than have the older AEDs and also performed as well
or better than the older AEDs in comparative studies. Espe-
cially, there appear to be fewer adverse cognitive effects for
GBP, LTG, and LEV than for CBZ. TPM is the newer AED
that is associated with the greatest risk of cognitive impair-
ment irrespective of the comparator group, although this risk
decreases with the use of slow titration and low target dosa-
ges. Although ZNS and PGB are tentatively associated with
some cognitive risks, the current data are insufficient for draw-
ing definitive conclusions.
Various factors can affect cognition in patients with epi-
lepsy, and clinicians require considerable skill to elucidate
these factors and mitigate those that can be influenced. The
cognitive impact of AEDs can potentially be alleviated, and
is therefore important to address. This should be seriously
considered in those who are at an age vulnerable to cognitive
function, e.g., children and the elderly, and who require max-
imal cognitive efficiency for their job, school, or daily activi-
ties. We therefore recommend that clinicians consider evalu-
ating cognitive function prior to adding or switching an AED,
with this evaluation including neuropsychological screening.
Since neuropsychological tests can objectively discriminate
subtle changes in cognitive function, they might assist when
deciding the appropriate AED for improving cognition.
Since findings from studies usually only provide information
on the “average” patient, individualization of AED therapy is
essential. If a certain AED impairs cognition, trying another
AED with a differing pharmacologic profile might be success-
ful. Most of all, it is critical to guard against overmedication.
Slow titration to the lowest effective dosage and avoiding
polytherapy when possible are keys to success. Refractori-
ness to AEDs should be determined as rapidly as possible. In
refractory patients, clinicians should consider video EEG mo-
nitoring to confirm the seizure diagnosis and determine if the
patient is a candidate for epilepsy surgery.
