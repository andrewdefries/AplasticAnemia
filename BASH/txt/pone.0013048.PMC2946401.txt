Abstract
Background: Telomeres shorten as cells divide. This shortening is compensated by the enzyme telomerase. We evaluated
the effect of common variants in the telomerase RNA component (TERC) gene on telomere length (TL) in the population-
based Health Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) Study and in two replication samples (the TwinsUK Study and the
Amish Family Osteoporosis Study, AFOS).
Methodology: Five variants were identified in the TERC region by sequence analysis and only one SNP was common
(rs2293607, G/A). The frequency of the G allele was 0.26 and 0.07 in white and black, respectively. Testing for association
between TL and rs2293607 was performed using linear regression models or variance component analysis conditioning on
relatedness among subjects.
Results: The adjusted mean TL was significantly shorter in 665 white carriers of the G allele compared to 887 non-carriers
from the Health ABC Study (4.6960.05 kbp vs. 4.8660.04 kbp, measured by quantitative PCR, p = 0.005). This association
was replicated in another white sample from the TwinsUK Study (6.9060.03 kbp in 301 carriers compared to 7.0660.03 kbp
in 395 non-carriers, measured by Southern blots, p = 0.009). A similar pattern of association was observed in whites from the
family-based AFOS and blacks from the Health ABC cohort, although not statistically significant, possibly due to the lower
allele frequency in these populations. Combined analysis using 2,953 white subjects from 3 studies showed a significant
association between TL and rs2293607 (b = 20.1960.04 kbp, p = 0.001).
Conclusion: Our study shows a significant association between a common variant in TERC and TL in humans, suggesting
that TERC may play a role in telomere homeostasis.

Introduction
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein polymerase that maintains
telomere ends by addition of the telomere DNA repeat TTAGGG
in humans. The core enzyme consists of a protein component with
reverse transcriptase activity (TERT), and an RNA component
(TERC) located on chromosome 3q26.2 that provides the template
for the telomere repeat. Several lines of evidence in experimental
and epidemiological research suggest that the human telomerase
RNA component is involved in telomere homeostasis [1,2,3]. The
wild-type telomerase RNA is assembled with small nucleolar
RNAs (snoRNA), small Cajalbody RNA (scaRNA) proteins, the
putative CAB box binding protein and telomerase reverse
transcriptase to form a functional telomerase complex that will
later be recruited to the chromosome ends and maintain telomere
length [4].
TERC is a small gene, 451 basepairs (bp) long, that is highly
expressed in the germline and in tumor cell lines, in which there is
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 9 | e13048
high telomerase activity, and at lower levels in tissues such as
kidney, prostate, and liver in which there is little detectable
telomerase activity. Mutations in TERC result in a reduction of
telomerase activity leading to premature telomere shortening and
have been linked to the autosomal dominant form of dyskeratosis
congenita and aplastic anemia [5,6]. Goldman et al. have observed
that individuals haploinsufficient for TERC have very short
telomeres [7]. They found that when TERC activity is limiting,
this leads to the accelerated shortening of telomeres. The limited
amount of active telomerase in individuals with TERC RNA
haploinsufficiency may not be able to maintain the minimal
critical telomere length in cells with already short telomeres. A
recent study reported that a common haplotype in the other
telomerase component, TERT, is associated with longer telomere
length in centenarians [8].
Following previous studies of rare mutations in TERC, this study
aimed at investigating whether common polymorphisms in or
around the TERC gene region may play a role in the regulation of
telomere length (TL) in normal populations.
Materials and Methods
Study populations
Three independent samples were used to investigate the
association between common variants in or around TERC and
TL. The first population is a biracial cohort (41% black and 59%
white) from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health
ABC) Study. As we observed a significant association in the white
samples only, we sought to replicate our initial findings in another
outbred white population from the TwinsUK Study and a white
founder population from the Amish Family Osteoporosis Study
(AFOS).
The Health ABC Study
The Health ABC Study population is a community-based
cohort of 3,075 healthy, well functioning men and women aged 70
to 79 years. To be eligible for participation in the study, subjects
had to report no difficulty in walking one-quarter mile (0.5
kilometers) or climbing 10 stairs without resting. Participants were
identified from a random sample of white Medicare beneficiaries
and all age-eligible black residents in designated zip code areas
surrounding Pittsburgh and Memphis. Exclusion criteria included
reported difficulty performing basic activities of daily living,
obvious cognitive impairment, inability to communicate with the
interviewer, intention of moving within three years, or participa-
tion in a trial involving a lifestyle intervention. A total of 2,620
subjects with TL measures and the TERC genotypic data available
were included in this study. All participants gave written informed
consent. The Committee on Human Research at both study sites
approved the protocol and written consent for the study.
The TwinsUK Study
The TwinsUK Study recruited white monozygotic (MZ) and
dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the TwinsUK adult twin registry, a
group designed to study the heritability and genetics of age-related
diseases (www.twinsuk.ac.uk). These twins were recruited from the
general population through national media campaigns in the UK
and shown to be comparable to age-matched population
singletons in terms of clinical phenotype and lifestyle character-
istics. A subset of 696 female subjects with TL measures and the
TERC genotypic data were included in this study. The study was
approved by St. Thomas’ Hospital Research Ethics Committee
and all twins provided informed written consent that was approved
by the Ethics Committee.
The Amish Family Osteoporosis Study
A total of 954 Old Order Amish subjects for this study were
recruited through the Amish Research Clinic in Strasburg, PA, as
part of the Amish Family Osteoporosis Study (AFOS), whose aim
was to identify genetic determinants of osteoporosis. The
recruitment methods and study objectives and design have been
described in details previously [9]. Briefly, individuals with low
bone mineral density or history of fracture were recruited into the
study as probands (n = 57). Their spouses and all first-degree
relatives aged 20 years and over were invited to participate in the
study. Genealogical information was obtained from the Fisher
Family History and the larger Anabaptist Genealogy Database
version 3.0 [10,11]. The protocol for the AFOS was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland, and
verbal informed consent as well as permission to contact relatives
was obtained from all participants. (Amish people do not use
signature, so only verbal consent was given and this was approved
by the review board).
Measurement of leukocyte telomere length in the Health
ABC Study and AFOS samples
The mean TL in leukocytes (peripheral blood mononucleocytes)
was measured using a validated quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)
method [12,13] which measures the relative average TL in
genomic DNA by determining the ratio of telomere repeat copy
number to single copy gene copy number (T/S ratio) in
experimental samples relative to a reference sample. The T signal
for an experimental DNA sample is the number of nanograms of
the reference DNA that matches the experimental sample for copy
number of the telomere repeats. The S signal is the number of
nanograms of the reference DNA that matches the experimental
sample for copy number of the single copy gene. Experimental
samples with T/S ratio .1.0 have longer average telomere lengths
than the reference DNA. Experimental samples with T/S ratio
,1.0 have shorter average telomere lengths than the reference
DNA. The reference DNA is a pooled sample of DNAs from
several normal Utah whites, aged 65 years or older. All samples
were measured in triplicate and the mean value was used. The
coefficient of variation (CV) for this assay was 4%. Results
obtained using this method correlate very well with those obtained
with the traditional terminal restriction fragment length (TRFL) by
Southern blot technique [12]. In comparison with the TRFL
method, the Q-PCR method is simple, fast, and less expensive,
and requires a significantly lower amount of DNA. To convert the
T/S value to basepairs, the T/S value was multiplied by a
conversion factor of 4,270 bp, which was the TL for the reference
DNA. To obtain the TL for the reference DNA, we used the T/S
ratios of 64 DNA samples with known mean TRF lengths. The
slope of the linear regression line through a plot of T/S ratio (the
X axis) vs. mean TRF length (the Y axis) is the number of
basepairs of telomeric DNA corresponding to a single T/S unit.
Since the reference DNA has a T/S of 1.0, by definition, this slope
is also the average TL of the reference DNA sample, 4,270 bp in
our case. Among the 3,075 participants at baseline, 2,880 subjects
had DNA available and TL was successfully measured in 2,721
individuals.
Measurement of leukocyte telomere length in the
TwinsUK Study samples
The mean leukocyte TL was assessed using the TRFL method,
which was measured using the Southern blot method in duplicates.
Briefly, each sample was digested using restriction enzymes HinfI (10
U) and RsaI (10 U) (Roche, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) and resolved

on 0.5% agarose gels. DNA was then depurinated and denatured.
Hybridization with digoxenin 39-end-labeled telomeric probes was
conducted overnight and probes detected using a digoxenin
luminescent detection procedure (Roche). The autoradiographs were
scanned and the TRFL signal was digitized at molecular weight 1–
20 kb. Conversion of the optical density versus DNA migration
distance to optical density adjusted for background/molecular weight
yielded a histogram from which the mean TRFL was calculated. The
CV of the TRFL assay in this study was 1.4%.
The laboratories conducting the telomere length measurements
were blinded to all characteristics of the leukocyte donors, who
were identifiable only by coded ID numbers.
Discovery and genotyping of the TERC variants
Variants in TERC covering the entire gene of 451 bp plus
385 bp upstream and 265 bp downstream of the coding region
were identified by conventional Sanger sequencing in pools of
PCR products (8 pools of white and 8 pools of black, with 5
individuals per pool). Because no protein is encoded by TERC, the
"coding" region refers to the sequence encoding the mature RNA
transcript. Sequencing was performed using the forward primer
and standard procedures on the ABI 3700 capillary sequencer.
Sequencing traces and subsequent genotyping were scored by 2
investigators blinded to phenotype (telomere measurement status).
Five SNPs were identified by sequence analysis and the allele
frequencies were estimated from the trace heights in pools (see
Table 1). The SNPs at base # 170,965,315 and 170,965,029 have
been previously reported and correspond to base # 228 and 514
in those reports [14,15]. The other three SNPs were newly
discovered. We genotyped these five SNPs in the full Health ABC
cohort by sequencing or by Illumina Golden Gate and
subsequently we genotyped the only common SNP in the
TwinsUK and the AFOS samples by the Taqman method.
Statistical analyses
The associations between leukocyte TL and common TERC
SNPs were modeled using linear regression models. Age, sex, race,
and the recruitment site were added to this model to control for
potential confounding. To account for the relatedness of twins in
the TwinsUK cohort, we used mixed linear models where the
random effect was the family of origin. Analyses for the Health
ABC and UK cohort data were carried out using the software
SPSS 14 for Windows (Chicago, IL) and analyses for the AFOS
cohort were conditioning on their relatedness and carried out
using the program SOLAR [16]. Since significant associations
were observed only in white, we also conducted combined analysis
by pooling data from all 3 white populations. The combined
analysis was carried out in SOLAR so that the relatedness among
subjects (in the TwinsUK and AFOS cohorts) can be taken into
account. In addition to covariates used in population-specific
analysis, the type of TL assay was also included as a covariate. A p
value ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Of the five variants identified by sequence analysis of the TERC
gene region, only one SNP (i.e. rs2293607, G/A) had a minor
allele frequency (MAF) .5% (see Table 1). The frequency of the
G allele was 0.12–0.26 in 3 white populations, and was 0.074 in
blacks (see Table 2). A total of 2,620 individuals (1,542 white and
1,078 black) from the Health ABC cohort, 696 female Caucasian
participants of the TwinsUK cohort and 745 Caucasian subjects
from the AFOS cohort were included in our analysis. Table 2
shows the baseline characteristics of the 3 study populations.
Participants in the Health ABC Study were older (mean age
= 73.762.9 years) compared to those in the TwinsUK (mean age
= 48.6613.4) and the AFOS (mean age = 50.4616.5) popula-
tions. However, the age range was much narrower in the Health
ABC cohort compared to the other two cohorts comprised of
younger participants. Nearly half of the Health ABC cohort and
62% of AFOS participants were female, while all participants of
the TwinsUK cohort were female.
Overall, the mean TL (kbp) measured by Q-PCR was longer
among Amish subjects (6.161.7 kbp) compared to that of the
Health ABC participants (4.961.2 kbp), but in the same age group
(70–79 years), the mean TL in 2 populations were similar. The
mean TL in the TwinsUK cohort measured by Southern blot
appeared to be longer (7.060.7 kbp). The frequency of the G
allele of rs2293607 was ,25% in 2 outbred white populations
while it was much rarer in the white founder population (the
Amish, 11.5%) and black samples (7.4%). Table 3 shows the mean
TL by rs2293607 genotypes. There was a significant difference in
the mean TL by genotypes (2-df test) in the Health ABC white
(p = 0.02) and the TwinsUK cohort (p = 0.05). A dose-response of
TL with respect to the number of G alleles was observed in the
Health ABC whites and the AFOS. Modeling of the association
between TL and rs2293607 genotypes suggested that a dominant
mode of inheritance for the minor G allele was the best fit to the
data. As shown in Table 3, among the Health ABC Study white
participants, the adjusted mean TL was significantly shorter in
carriers of the G allele (4.6960.05 kbp vs. 4.8660.04 kbp in
non-carriers, p,0.005). No significant difference was observed
in blacks (4.8560.10 kbp in carriers of the G allele vs.
4.8860.04 kbp in non-carriers, p = 0.8). We successfully replicated
the association in whites from the TwinsUK Study. The adjusted
mean TL was significantly (p,0.009) shorter in carriers of the G
allele compared to non-carriers. In the AFOS, carriers of the G
allele appeared to have shorter TL on average compared to non-
carriers, but the difference was not statistically significant.

TERC SNP and Telomere Length
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 September 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 9 | e13048
As the effect of rs2293607 appeared similar among 3 white
study populations, we pooled data from all these populations
(n = 2,983) and found that the mean TL for carriers of the minor
G allele was 0.19 kbp shorter than non-carriers (b =
20.1960.04 kbp, p,0.001).
Discussion
We observed that the G allele of the SNP rs2293607 near TERC
(63 bps upstream from the start site) was significantly associated
with shorter telomere length in a US white population and
replicated the findings in another younger white population in the
UK. On the other hand, we did not observe such an association in
whites from the family-based AFOS or in blacks from the Health
ABC cohort. The G allele was rarer in the AFOS sample (frequency
= 11.5%) and in the blacks (7.4%) compared to whites from Health
ABC Study (24.2%) or the TwinsUK Study (26.3%). Thus, the non-
significant associations in these two populations are likely due to the
lack of sufficient statistical power (we had only 55% power) to detect
the same effect size observed in the Health ABC cohort.
A recently published genome-wide association study of telomere
length by Codd et al. reported their top signal to be rs12696304,
1.5 kb downstream of TERC [17]. This SNP resides in the same
LD block of 33 kb and is 1,066 bps away (NCBI build 36.3) from
our reported SNP rs2293607. We looked into this region more
closely for all typed SNPs in the 33 kb block, including
rs12696304. All of these SNPs were significantly associated with
telomere length, but rs2293607 still gave the strongest signal and is
in high LD (r2
= 0.90) with rs12696304. The SNP rs2293607 is not
typed by the Hapmap and therefore not included in any high-
throughput genotyping platform. As this SNP is closer to the
mature RNA transcript of TERC, it might be a better target for
further functional studies. Both this report and the report by Codd
et al. detected the RNA template of telomerase as major
determinant for human telomere length variation. It is interesting
that the yeast TERC ortholog, TLC1, is a major telomere length
QTL in the natural population [18]. It does appear that this gene
is prone to be a determinant for telomere length variation. This
could be due to its dynamic structure or by differences in gene

expression. Indeed, a number of telomerase RNA template
molecules appear to be a limiting factor of telomere elongation
in budding yeast. Similarly, there is a pronounced TERC
haploinsufficiency effect in human telomeres and this agrees with
our findings for the rs2293607 SNP.
One possible issue of our replication sample is that the
TwinsUK study subjects consisted only of females. However, in
the Health ABC cohort the reported association did not differ by
sex. Another issue has to do with different methods for measuring
TL. TL was measured by the Q-PCR method in the Health ABC
and Amish cohorts while it was measured by the TRFL method in
the TwinsUK Study. The TRFL method tends to make the TL
about 2.5 kb longer as it includes the subtelomeric region in its
measurement. Nevertheless, the strength of the association and the
effect size estimates appeared comparable based on either method.
There have been debates regarding TL measurements as to
whether different methods for TL measurement could affect the
informativeness of TL measures for genetic and epidemiological
studies involving TL [19,20,21]. Therefore, it is reassuring that we
were able to replicate our observed association in the Health ABC
Study (TL measured by the Q-PCR method) and in the TwinsUK
Study (TL measured by the TRFL method). In addition, in the
combined analysis adjusted for the method of TL measurement,
the observed association remained significant and in the same
direction.
Some environmental factors like smoking are found to affect TL
[22]. In our study, TL was not associated with smoking and
adjusting for smoking did not alter our observations. We however
adjusted our analysis for the TL assay’s plate effects which has
been associated to TL measurements in several laboratories.
The TERC and TERT genes encode the core essential
elements of the telomerase complex that replicates telomeres and
maintains their length. Mutations in TERC have been previously
linked to telomere shortening in mouse models [23]. Studies in
human have also shown that rare mutations in TERC are
associated with telomere shortening in individuals with dyskera-
tosis congenita [4,7,24]. Our study extends these observations to
populations free of congenital or other severe diseases. The
biological relevance of our observations is further supported by a
recent report that variants in another telomerase RNA compo-
nent, TERT, are also associated with TL in humans. Both TERT
and TERC are essential for telomerase function. The TERC region
does not appear to be conserved in evolution. There is an open
reading frame (ORF) antisense to TERC. However, the likelihood
that there is a protein encoded on either strand of the TERC locus
is extremely remote, as indicated by codon usage/substitution
patterns in the ORFs, the lack of peptides in mass spectrometry
databases that map to these ORFS, and the lack of homology of
any of the ORFS to any known protein sequence. There is not yet
functional information on rs2293607 and it is beyond the scope of
our current investigation. One possible functional study is to take
advantage of the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells technique
since TERC upregulation is a feature of the pluripotent state and
several telomerase components are targeted by pluripotency-
associated transcription factors [25]. Conventionally, genes that do
not encode proteins are thought to be of little relevance with
clinically measurable phenotypes. However, a growing number of
human studies of RNA genes such as TERC [17] and microRNA
genes [26] suggest that non-coding regions such as these RNA
genes may harbor genetic variants of clinical relevance.
Taken together, our findings suggest that common variants in
the TERC gene in normal healthy populations may be involved in
telomere homeostasis. Our observations further re-enforce the
idea that variants nearby genes encoding functional RNAs may
potentially be biologically important.
