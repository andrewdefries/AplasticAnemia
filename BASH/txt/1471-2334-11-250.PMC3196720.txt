Abstract
Background: Risk factors and outcomes in hematological patients who acquire invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS) are
infrequently reported in the modern medical era.
Method: A retrospective study of hospitalized patients with hematological disease was conducted at National
Taiwan University Hospital between January 1995 and December 2009.
Results: Clinical characteristics and outcomes with their associated radiographic and microbiological findings were
analyzed. Forty-six patients with IFS and 64 patients with chronic non-invasive sinusitis were enrolled as
comparsion. IFS developed more commonly in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and with prolonged
neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm3
for more than 10 days) (p < 0.001). Aspergillus flavus
was the most common pathogen isolated (44%). Serum Aspergillus galactomannan antigen was elevated in seven
of eleven patients (64%) with IFS caused by aspergillosis but negative for all three patients with mucormycosis.
Bony erosion and extra-sinus infiltration was found in 15 of 46 (33%) patients on imaging. Overall, 19 of 46 patients
(41.3%) died within 6 weeks. Patients with disease subtype of AML (p = 0.044; Odds Ratio [OR], 5.84; 95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 1.02-30.56) and refractory leukemia status (p = 0.05; OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 1.003-18.15) had
worse prognosis. Multivariate analysis identified surgical debridement as an independent good prognostic factor
(p = 0.047) in patients with IFS.
Conclusions: Patients of AML with prolonged neutropenia (> 10 days) had significantly higher risk of IFS. Early
introduction of anti-fungal agent and aggressive surgical debridement potentially decrease morbidity and mortality
in high risk patients with IFS.

Background
Chemotherapy is still the current standard treatment for
hematological malignancy and febrile neutropenia is a
common complication of chemotherapy in most patients
[1]. If fever persists 72-96 hours after treatment with
broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotics during neutrope-
nia, invasive fungal infection may be suspected and treated
empirically with antifungal agents [1-3]. However, since
the culture methods are insensitive and radiologic findings
are nonspecific, the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection
remains a challenge [4]. An international consensus on the
diagnosis of opportunistic invasive fungal infections in
immunocompromised patients with cancer and hemato-
poietic stem cell transplants was established by the Inva-
sive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group of the European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) and the Mycoses Study Group of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (MSG-NIAID)
[5,6]. Delay in the treatment of invasive fungal infection
during neutropenia causes high mortality in patients with
transplants and hematological malignancy [4,5,7]. The

uncertainty in disease diagnosis results in under- or over-
treatment of invasive fungal infection. Despite the avail-
ability of several new antifungal agents, including triazoles
and echinocandins, the effectiveness of antifungal therapy
remains uncertain and the effectiveness of neutrophil
recovery may not be sufficient if the recovering neutro-
phils are dysfunctional [8].
Invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS) is a rare disease largely
attributable to Aspergillus and Mucor in patients with
stem cell transplants and hematological disease [9].
Though the mortality of IFS in immunocompromised
patients ranges from 50% to 80% [7,9,10], early physical
findings are non-specific and ambiguous (i.e., nasal
obstruction, purulent discharge, and epistaxis). Water’s
view plain radiographs do not distinguish invasive fungal
sinusitis from chronic allergic sinusitis. Bony erosion
and tissue destruction is often found only in the
advanced stage by computed tomography [11,12].
Recent introduction of serial Aspergillus galactomannan
antigen test may provide early evidence of IFS. In this
study, clinical characteristics were retrospectively
reviewed and their correlation with outcome was evalu-
ated to identify prognostic factors in patients with
hematological disorders and IFS.
Methods
Patients
National Taiwan University Hospital is a 2200-bed teach-
ing hospital that provides both primary and tertiary care
in metropolitan Taipei. More than 600 admissions
annually comprise adult patients with hematological
malignancies for in-patient chemotherapy. Lymphoma,
acute myeloid leukemia and myeloma were the three
most common hematological diagnoses [13].
The search terms “sinusitis” and “sinonasal infection”
were used to identify reports in the discharge summary
database of all patients admitted to the Department of
Internal Medicine between January 1995 and December
2009. Patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplants,
hematological disease (including severe aplastic anemia,
pure red cell aplasia, and hematological malignancy),
and sinusitis diagnosed during their hospital stay were
enrolled in this study. Patients with hematological disor-
ders and chronic non-invasive sinusitis admitted in the
same period of time cohort were enrolled as controls.
Demographic features, hematological disease status,
underlying medical diseases, chemotherapy regimen
before diagnosis of fungal sinusitis, evidence (clinical,
microbiological, pathological, and radiological) showing
fungal sinusitis, antifungal therapy, and outcome were
collected and analyzed retrospectively. This research
conformed to the Helsinki Declaration and local legisla-
tion, and approved by the local ethics committee.
Diagnosis of Sinusitis
During the study period, patients with hematological
malignancy developed sinusitis were routinely to take
sinus X-ray and otolaryngist was consulted for focal eva-
luation and tissue culture. CT and MRI sinus study, sur-
gical biopsy and debridement were performed according
to clinicians’ decision.
Diagnosis, Prophylaxis and Treatment of invasive fungal
sinusitis
Physicians clinically diagnosed IFS in all these patients
according to EORTC/MSG-NIAID consensus criteria in
2008 [5,6]. The host factors included prolonged neutro-
penia (< 500 neutrophils/mm3
for > 10 days) temporally
related to the onset of fungal disease, receipt of an allo-
geneic stem cell transplant, prolonged use of corticoster-
oids, immunosuppressive agents, or nucleoside analogues
during the past 90 days. The clinical criteria included
imaging showing sinusitis plus at least one of the follow-
ing three signs: acute localized pain, nasal ulcer with
black eschar, extension from the paranasal sinus across
the bony barrier. The microbiological criteria included
culture or isolation of fungus from surgical material or
sinus aspirate samples, and detection of Aspergillus galac-
tomannan antigens in serum. In our institution, an opti-
cal density (OD) index of 0.5 or higher is considered
positive for aspergillus galactomannan test.
No routine anti-fungal prophylaxis was prescribed in
hematological patients receiving standard chemotherapy.
Fluconazole was used as antifungal prophylactic agent in
the recipients of stem cell transplantation. Timing and
choice of pre-emptive anti-fungal therapy was based on
clinical judgment according to the presence of any of
the following high risk factors: local symptoms and
signs of sinusitis, elevated serum Aspergillus galacto-
mannan antigen, or abnormal CT imaging. The mainte-
nance dose of each antifungal agent is as following:
amphotericin B 1-1.5 mg/kg/day, amphotericin B liposo-
mal 3-5 mg/kg/day, capsofungin acetate 50 mg/day, and
voriconazole 400 mg/day.
Proven, probable, and possible invasive fungal sinusitis
Proven, probable, and possible IFS were defined mainly
according to the EORTC/MSG-NIAID criteria [5,6].
Proven IFS was defined by the presence of fungi asso-
ciated tissue damage on histopathologic examination of
a biopsy specimen; or positive culture result, consistent
with infection, from a sample obtained aseptically from
a clinically or radiologically abnormal site. Probable IFS
was defined by the presence of at least one host factor
criterion, one microbiological criterion, and one clinical
criterion. Possible IFS was defined by the presence of at
least one host factor criterion and one clinical criterion.

Survival and Mortality
The survival is defined from diagnosis of invasive fungal
sinusitis to patients died. Attributable mortality to invasive
fungal sinusitis is defined if patient died within 6 weeks,
and there were no other attributable cause of death.
Statistics
Comparisons were made using the chi-square test. Predic-
tors of survival were identified using a Cox regression
model. Factors which p level is below 0.2 in the univariate
analysis were selected for multivariate Cox regression ana-
lysis. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
13.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). A p value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Clinical characteristics of patients with IFS
The diagnosis of invasive fungal sinusitis was made in 46
patients with hematological disorders, and 64 patients
with hematological disorders and chronic non-invasive
sinusitis admitted in the same period of time cohort were
enrolled as controls. There was no outbreak of invasive
fungal sinusitis detected in this study. The overall inci-
dence of IFS is 1.77 per 1000 patients. The incidence and
trend of IFS in adult hematological patients was shown in
Table 1. There were trends of decreasing incidence and
mortality during the study period, although these did not
attain statistically significance (p = 0.199 and 0.223).
IFS was proven in 25 patients (54%), probable in 5
patients (11%), and possible in 16 patients (35%). Their
clinical characteristics are shown in Table 2. Compared
with chronic non-specific sinusitis, IFS was more common
in patients with disease subtype of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) than in patients with other types of hematological
malignancy (p < 0.001) and more common in patients with
absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm3
for ≥10 days.
The occurrence of IFS was not affected by underlying dia-
betes mellitus, hematological disease status, chemotherapy
intensity, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Microbiological spectrum
Among the 25 patients with proven invasive fungal sinusi-
tis, fifteen patients had positive biopsy showed hyphae
with Giemsa stain or PAS stain, and 14 patients showed
positive fungal cultures. The fungal isolates from 25
patients with proven invasive fungal sinusitis included:
Aspergillus flavus (12), Aspergillus fumigatus (2), Aspergil-
lus vesicolor (1), Aspergillus sybowii (1), unidentified
Aspergillus species (1), Mucor (4), Phaeohyphomyces (1),
Fusarium (1), Penicillium (1), and unidentified fungal
species (1).
Aspergillus galactomannan antigen test
Sixteen patients during 2005 to 2009 had serial follow-up
of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen. The mean value
(+/- SD) of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen test is
2.32 (+/- 1.86). The mean value (standard deviation) of
Aspergillus galactomannan antigen in the seven patients
with positive results was 2.32 (1.86), compared with
those with negative results 0.13 (0.07). The p value
(0.048) is below 0.05. Aspergillus galactomannan antigen
was not elevated in three patients with mucormycosis
sinusitis. Aspergillus galactomannan antigen was elevated
in seven of eleven patients with aspergillus sinusitis. One
patient with phaeohyphomycosis-related sinusitis and one
patient with sinusitis caused by Fusarium and Penicillium
marneffei also showed elevated aspergillus galactoman-
nan antigen. The sensitivity of serum galactomannan
antigen testing was 64% and the specificity was 60% for
the detection of invasive aspergillus sinusitis. (Table 3)
Radiological manifestations
Sinus imaging by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance (MRI) were performed in 44 (96%) of patients
with IFS and 37 (59%) of 63 patients with chronic non-
specific sinusitis. Evidence of extra-sinus tissue involve-
ment and/or bony destruction were detected in 15 (33%)
of patients with IFS. In addition, brain abscess complicat-
ing IFS was found in two patients and cavernous sinus
thrombosis in one patient.
Treatment and outcome
Pre-emptive antifungal treatment was given in 43 (94%)
of 46 patients with IFS. Fourteen of sixty-four patients
with non-IFS received pre-emptive antifungal therapy
initially, and these agents were discontinued after

excluding the diagnosis of IFS. The overall mortality rate
of patients with IFS was 41% (Table 2). The attributable
mortality of patients with AML was also much higher
than non-AML patients. All the patients died rapidly due
to IFS (median survival, 15 days; 25th
and 75th
percentile,
10 and 34 days, respectively). Six-week survival was not
significantly different between patients who had received
antifungal combination therapy (amphotericin B plus
capsofungin and amphotericin B plus voriconazole vs
amphotericin B) compared to those who had received
monotherapy (p = 0.74). All four patients with mucormy-
coses had received high dose antifungal therapy and
aggressive surgical debridement, but three died within 6
weeks. Twelve patients with proven invasive fungal sinu-
sitis and two patients with possible invasive fungal sinusi-
tis underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery for
debridement. The median interval between diagnosis and
surgical debridement is 11.5 days (range 1-38 days).
Nineteen of 46 patients (41%) with IFS and 8 of 64
patients (13%) with non-invasive sinusitis died within 6
weeks after diagnosis of sinusitis. The 6-week mortality
rate was significantly higher in patients with IFS than
those with non-invasive sinusitis (p = 0.001). Univariate
analysis of 6-week outcomes in patients with hematologi-
cal disorders and invasive fungal sinusitis is summarized
in Table 4. The acute myeloid leukemia disease subtype
(p = 0.044) and refractory disease status were associated
with worse outcomes (p = 0.05). The intensity of che-
motherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation were
not independent prognostic factors of invasive fungal
infection in this study. The median interval between neu-
tropenia and diagnosis of IFS was not significantly differ-
ent between non-survivors and survivors (median 19
days vs 21 days, p = 0.677). Multivariate Cox regression
analysis revealed functional endoscopic sinus surgery for
debridement as the only independent prognostic factor
for survival (p = 0.047).
Discussion
In this large retrospective study, we estimated IFS
occurred in 1.77% of hospitalized patients with hematolo-
gical disorders. IFS caused significantly higher mortality
in AML patients with prolonged neutropenia (> 10 days).
We identified surgical debridement is an independent
factor associated with good outcome.
IFS developed more frequently in patients with AML,
myelodysplastic syndrome, and aplastic anemia, but not at
all in patients with lymphoma/myeloma. In the literature
review, most patients with lymphoma who developed IFS
are recipients of myeloablative allogeneic stem cell trans-
plants [14-18]. Compared with other subtypes of hemato-
logical malignancy, patients with AML had significantly
higher risk of IFS. The risk of developing IFS in AML
relates to neutropenia (p < 0.001) and less to the intensity
of chemotherapy regimens. The mortality of patients with
AML was also much greater than non-AML patients.
Prolonged neutropenia in patients with myeloid malig-
nancies may contribute to underlying disease, intensity
and dosage of chemotherapy, colony-stimulating factor,
and concurrent medication. Invasive mold infection often
occurs when a large burden of spores from an environ-
mental source is deposited on mucosal membranes lack-
ing an effective phagocytic host defense [19]. Using
cytokine growth factors to decrease the period of che-
motherapy-associated neutropenia and using laminar air
flow rooms for protection against IFS [20] may reduce
the risk of IFS after allogeneic stem cell transplantation
[21]. In this study, we found a lower incidence and mor-
tality of IFS in 2005-2009 than in 1994-1999.
The clinical mycological spectrum of IFS is limited in
patients with stem cell transplants and hematological dis-
ease [14-18]. Aspergillus and Mucor are the main mold
found in biopsy, however, the prevalence is highly vari-
able in different geographic regions [14-18,22,23]. In our
study, Aspergillus flavus (44%) was the most common
isolate. Aspergillus flavus, with its unique ability to sur-
vive at higher temperatures, is the predominant pathogen
in countries, including most of the Middle East, Africa,
and Southeast Asia [24,25]. Rare IFS in Asia and Africa
were reported, the clinical response varies differently
with fungal subtypes, and further epidemiology study
should be investigated. Mucormycosis is an emerging
cause of IFS with a rapid fatal course in patients with
hematological disorders [26,27]. In our study, all four
patients with mucormycoses had received high dose anti-
fungal therapy and aggressive surgical debridement, but
three died within 6 weeks (mortality, 75%). Effective
treatment for Mucormycosis should be investigated.
The symptoms and signs of paranasal sinusitis (such as
nasal discharge, stuffiness, epistaxis, periorbital swelling,

toms and signs such as nose ulceration, eschar of the nasal
mucosa, black necrotic lesions, and perforation of the hard
palate are more specific, but these findings are present only
at an advanced stage. The use of CT and MRI in the diag-
nosis of invasive fungal sinusitis has been reported [12].
Diagnostic radiological evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis
includes erosion of sinus walls, extension of infection to

neighboring structures, and extensive skull base destruc-
tion. However, most patients do not have classic findings
in the early phase of invasive fungal sinusitis. Earlier diag-
nosis by using serial Aspergillus galactomannan antigen
test in the modern medical era to detect IFS, may lead to
early introduce anti-fungal agent and surgical debridement,
and potentially decreased morbidity and mortality in high
risk patients.
There are some limitations in this study. First, this is a
retrospective time cohort study in a single university
institution in Taiwan. Therefore, information of labora-
tory results, such as Aspergillus galactomannan antigen
test, might be limited. Second, surgical approach of
sinusitis were performed according to clinicians’ deci-
sion, thus, the etiology of control patients were not
available. Third, as IFS is not a common disease in
patients with heamatological disorder, the case numbers
is limited.
In conclusion, outcome of IFS is usually very poor
[11,28]. In this study, functional endoscopic sinus surgery
for debridement was the only indicator of better prognosis
in multivariate analysis. This result confirms previous find-
ings indicating that sinus surgery improves outcome
[28,29]. Aggressive surgical debridement combined with
antifungal therapy, should be emphasized in leukemic
patients in spite of their prolonged neutropenia and bleed-
ing tendencies. Whether the intensity of chemotherapy
and allogeneic stem cell transplantation were the indepen-
dent prognosis of invasive fungal infection need further
investigation.
