Abstract
Background: The use of hypertonic crystalloid solutions, including sodium chloride and
bicarbonate, for treating severe sepsis has been much debated in previous investigations. We have
investigated the effects of three crystalloid solutions on fluid resuscitation in severe sepsis patients
with hypotension.
Methods: Ninety-four severe sepsis patients with hypotension were randomly assigned to three
groups. The patients received the following injections within 15 min at initial treatment: Ns group
(n = 32), 5 ml/kg normal saline; Hs group (n = 30), with 5 ml/kg 3.5% sodium chloride; and Sb group
(n = 32), 5 ml/kg 5% sodium bicarbonate. Cardiac output (CO), systolic blood pressure, mean
arterial pressure (MAP), body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate and blood gases were
measured.
Results: There were no differences among the three groups in CO, MAP, heart rate or respiratory
rate during the 120 min trial or the 8 hour follow-up, and no significant differences in observed
mortality rate after 28 days. However, improvement of MAP and CO started earlier in the Sb group
than in the Ns and Hs groups. Sodium bicarbonate increased the base excess but did not alter blood
pH, lactic acid or [HCO3]- values; and neither 3.5% hypertonic saline nor 5% sodium bicarbonate
altered the Na+, K+, Ca2+ or Cl- levels.
Conclusion: All three crystalloid solutions may be used for initial volume loading in severe sepsis,
and sodium bicarbonate confers a limited benefit on humans with severe sepsis.

Background
Severe sepsis has been recognized as an increasingly seri-
ous clinical problem, accounting for substantial morbid-
ity and mortality. Critical status, organ hypoperfusion,
volume deficiency and hypotension characterize its early
phase. Therefore, initial care of patients with severe sepsis,
such as early volume fluid loading and antibiotic treat-
ment on admission, is emphasized as an early interven-
tion [1-3]. In previous studies, the following benefits of
crystalloid fluids have been demonstrated: (1) large-vol-
ume resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids conferred the
highest survival rates; (2) extracellular fluid was redistrib-
uted during shock into both the intravascular and intrac-
ellular spaces; and (3) optimal resuscitation to correct this
extracellular fluid deficit required infusion of a 3:1 ratio of
isotonic crystalloid fluid and blood. Normal saline is the
isotonic crystalloid fluid commonly used for volume
loading in severe sepsis [2-4].
Small volume resuscitation with hypertonic saline
appears to be effective for patients with sepsis or models
of experimental severe sepsis [1]. In previous studies,
hypertonic saline in dextran improved the hemodynamics
of sepsis patients more effectively than an equivalent vol-
ume of normal saline [5-7]. Experimental studies in severe
sepsis have also shown beneficial effects [8-11]. In rabbits
with septic shock, 5 ml/kg hypertonic (3.5%) saline with-
out colloid induced a decline in cardiac contractility and
a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP), and eventu-
ally resulted in the death of the animals [12]; whereas in
macaque models, the same fluid resuscitation improved
myocardial performance [13,14]. We believe that hyper-
tonic saline differs in effectiveness between primates and
non-primates. Therefore, hypertonic crystalloid resuscita-
tion of severe sepsis patients needs to be investigated in
clinical trials.
Sodium bicarbonate has been used clinically for resusci-
tating sepsis patients, but its efficiency against acidosis
and septic shock is the subject of widespread controversy
[13-28]. In clinical practice before the 1990s, perfusion
with 5% sodium bicarbonate at 5 ml/kg was recom-
mended for fluid resuscitation of severe sepsis and septic
shock patients [15-19]. The reasons were as follows. (1)
Hypoperfusion in a single organ resulted in hypoxia and
lactic acidosis in this organ, but the arterial blood pH
might be normal in early septic shock and severe sepsis.
Therefore, normal pH in septic shock did not contraindi-
cate bicarbonate. (2) Acidosis impairs myocardial per-
formance and alters renal blood flow; alkalinized blood
might improve cardiovascular performance [20,21]. (3)
Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate appeared to be effective
for volume replacement. However, it has recently been
shown that acidosis might have a protective effect. A low
pH has been shown to delay the onset of cell death, but
accelerating pH correction removes the protective effect
and accelerates cell death. Also, acidosis during reper-
fusion limits the size of myocardial infarctions [22-25]. In
experimental investigations of septic shock, sodium bicar-
bonate aggravated the pathophysiological state in non-
primates such as rats [12], rabbits [26] and ponies [27].
There is no agreement about the use of sodium bicarbo-
nate for treating severe sepsis, and it has not been com-
monly recommended in clinical practice since the 1990s
[28]. However, the effect of sodium bicarbonate in pri-
mates is different. We recently demonstrated that admin-
istration of sodium bicarbonate improved the
performance of the myocardium and normalized the
hemodynamic parameters in macaque models [13,14].
The macaque model data suggest that 5% sodium bicar-
bonate is beneficial in fluid resuscitation during early
phase septic shock in primates. We believe that the effects
of sodium bicarbonate differ between primates and non-
primates because of the physiological difference between
the two types of animals. In view of our findings in
macaques, we consider that sodium bicarbonate might be
effective for treating severe sepsis and early septic shock in
humans because macaques and humans are both pri-
mates and are physiologically similar.
The above findings enable us to speculate that crystalloid
solutions, whether isotonic normal saline or hypertonic
crystalloid fluids, are effective for initial volume loading
in severe sepsis, and to consider that the effect of crystal-
loid solutions on severe sepsis should be assessed. Five
percent sodium bicarbonate, with an osmotic pressure of
1190 mOsm/l, is hypertonic. The osmolality of 3.5%
sodium chloride (1197 mOsm/l) is similar to that of 5%
sodium bicarbonate, and this solution was used to control
osmolality in the rabbit and macaque studies [12,13].
Therefore, a contrast-randomized clinical protocol of
equal volumes (5 ml/kg) of various solutions, namely
normal saline, 5% sodium bicarbonate and 3.5% sodium
chloride, was designed in the present study.
Over a period of about twenty years, many authors have
investigated the physiological signs of septic shock and
their treatment [29-34]. Initial treatment of septic patients
is critical for ensuring their survival, and therapy for severe
sepsis is emphasized as an early intervention. Crystalloid
solutions are effective as immediate perfusions for initial
volume replacement, but are effective for only 2–3 hours
[34]. Our study, therefore, focused on the initial effects of
three crystalloid solutions on early-phase severe sepsis,
120 min after the administration of the bolus of fluid.
Methods
This is a prospective, randomized and multicentric study
conducted in five hospitals of Jiangsu Province, China: the
Second Hospital of Nanjing, affiliated with Medical

School of Southeast University; the First People's Hospital
of Huai'an City; the People's Hospital of Gaochun
County; the Emergency Department of the First Hospital
of Nanjing, affiliated with Nanjing Medical University;
and the Emergency Department of the Jiangsu Province
Hospital, affiliated with Nanjing Medical University. This
research was carried out in accordance with the Declara-
tion of Helsinki (2000) of the World Medical Association.
The protocol was approved by the Health Office of Jiangsu
Provincial Government and by all the hospital ethics com-
mittees. Five hundred and thirty-two patients with severe
sepsis in these five hospitals were diagnosed between Jun
01, 2001 and Oct 31, 2005, and 94 of the 532 subjects
were enrolled in the study.
Enrolment
Severe sepsis and septic shock were defined according to
the criteria reported by Bone and colleagues. Hypotension
is determined by a systolic blood pressure lower than 90
mm Hg or a reduction of 40 mm Hg from baseline. SIRS
criteria consist of a suspected sepsis source and two of the
four SIRS criteria (temperature >38°C or <36°C, heart
rate >90 beats/min, respiratory rate >20 breaths/min,
PaCO2 <32 mm Hg, or white blood cell count >12,000
cells per mm3, <4,000 cells per mm3, or >10% band cells).
The status of shock patients may include but is not limited
to lactic acidosis, oliguria or an acute alteration in mental
state [35].
The criteria for patient enrolment were: (1) hypotension,
namely, systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg, or
MAP lower than 70 mmHg, or a reduction of 40 mm Hg
from baseline; (2) two of four SIRS, or a positive blood
culture. Items (1) and (2) were necessary for enrolment.
All the enrolled patients signed informed consent docu-
ments within 1 h of arrival, and child patients had their
informed consent documents signed by their guardians.
Exclusion
Patients with any of the following were excluded: myocar-
dial infarction, hemorrhagic shock, trauma, pregnancy,
do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders, requirement for
immediate surgery, or death imminent within 24 hours.
In order to focus the study on early phase severe sepsis,
patients with final-phase septic shock characterized on
admission by coma, seizure, diffuse intravascular coagula-
tion (DIC), pulmonary edema and anuria were rejected.
To determine the effect of crystalloid solutions on hemo-
dynamics, cases treated with vasopressors, inotropic
agents, colloids and mechanical ventilation during the
initial two hours after admission were excluded because
those treatments may markedly influence cardiovascular
function.
Scores for physiology of patients
The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE) II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score
(SAPS) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score
(SOFA) were computed for all the patients from physio-
logical measurements obtained on admission. Expected
mortality rates for APACHE II and SAPS II scores were cal-
culated using the logistic regression calculations suggested
by Knaus and Le Gall [36-38]. The clinical data are sum-
marized in Table 1.
Program of treatment
Using a randomized block design, the 94 patients were
randomly assigned to three groups. Patients in these
groups received the following injections within 15 min of
initial treatment: Ns group (n = 32), 5 ml/kg normal
saline; Hs group (n = 30), 5 ml/kg 3.5% sodium chloride;
and Sb group (n = 32), 5 ml/kg 5% sodium bicarbonate.
At 100 min after T0, all patients were injected with 20 ml/
kg 0.9% normal saline. None of the patients received any
additional therapy such as vasopressors, colloids or
mechanical ventilation within 120 min of the trial.
At T120 (120 min after T0), all patients were treated accord-
ing to management guidelines for severe sepsis and septic
shock [39]. The therapy that best suited the physiological
status of the patient was performed, including administra-
tion of vasopressors/inotropics, colloid resuscitation,
blood product transfusion or mechanical ventilation.
Broad spectrum antibiotics were given to all patients and
were altered according to blood culture and sensitivity
findings.
Outcome measures
Cardiac output (CO), systolic blood pressure, mean arte-
rial pressure (MAP), body temperature, heart rate and res-
piratory rate were measured at the time that fluid
resuscitation was started (T0); measurements were taken
once every 30 min for 120 min after T0 (T30, T60, T90 and
T120) and once at the 8 h point after T0 (T8h). Blood gases
were measured at T0 and T120. CO was detected using color
Doppler echocardiography [Aloka-SSD 5000-SV, Japan,
or LOGIQ BOOK portable ultrasound scanners, GE, USA],
and the CO parameters were calculated according to the
recommendations of the American Society of Echocardi-
ography [40,41].
Random grouping of cases and registration of parameters
were operated by professional statisticians at the hospitals
rather than by physicians. CO was measured by a profes-
sional echocardiographic doctor.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows, v13.0 (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). A two-way ANOVA, with one of

the ways being repeated measures, was performed first.
Then a statistician tested for differences between the
groups directly and for differences within a group. All
physiological values are given as means ± SD, but age is
presented as mean ± SD and median (minimum-maxi-
mum). Significance was defined as p < 0.05.
Results
Patient outcomes
The demographic data are presented in Table 1. Before
solution resuscitation was started there were no signifi-
cant differences among the three groups in severity scores
(APACHE II, SAPSII and SOFA). When the expected mor-
talities in the Ns group were compared with those in the
Hs or the Sb group by the APACHE II and SAPS II scores,
no significant differences were found (Table 1). Interven-
tion was completed in all 94 patients in 120 min, and the

follow-up was completed in 8 h. Five patients in the Ns
group died on the 6th, 10th, 18th, 20th and 25th days follow-
ing intervention; 5 in the Hs group died on the 7th, 9th,
15th, 20th and 25th days; and 5 in the Sb group died on the
6th, 10th, 15th, 19th and 25th days. There were no significant
differences in mortality rates between the Ns, Hs and Sb
groups.
Cardiac output and blood pressure
On admission, all the patients had abnormal tempera-
ture, abnormal white blood cell count, hyperpnea, tachy-
cardia, decreased CO and hypotension.
Echocardiograms were recorded by the Teichholz method
from the left parasternal window, and the parameters of
cardiac function such as CO were read directly. At T0, the
CO was 3.17 ± 0.79 l/min in the Ns group, 3.37 ± 0.99 l/
min in the Hs group and 3.34 ± 0.65 l/min in the Sb
group. CO was compared at serial time points after fluid
resuscitation with that at T0 in the same group: it increased
significantly at T120 in the Ns group, at T8h in the Hs group
and at T60 in the Sb group (Fig. 1). CO improved earlier in
the Sb group than in the Ns or Hs groups. However, there
were no differences in CO among the three groups at the
same time points.
In all three groups, MAP at T0 was lower than 70 mm Hg:
61.21 ± 9.69 mm Hg in the Ns group, 62.55 ± 10.95 mm
Hg in the Hs group and 59.38 ± 9.79 mm Hg in the Sb
group. Normal saline treatment resulted in a marked
increase of MAP at T60, 3.5% sodium chloride at T8h and
5% sodium bicarbonate at T30. MAP improved earlier in
the Sb group than in the Ns and Hs groups. However,
there were no differences in MAP among the three groups
at the same time points (Fig. 2).
On admission, the patients in all three groups suffered
from hyperpnea and tachycardia. Fluid resuscitation did

nificantly higher than at T0 in the Ns group; the parameter at T8h was higher than at T0 in the Hs group; and CO at T60, T90, T120
and T8h were higher than that at T0 in the Sb group (*p < 0.05). CO improved earlier in the Sb group than in the Ns and Hs
groups.

not alter the heart rates or respiratory rates after 120 min
in any of the three groups, but caused a decrease of heart
and respiratory rates in the Sb group and a decrease of
heart rate in the Ns group at T8h (Figs. 3 and 4).
Acid-basic balance and electrolytes
The blood pH, lactic acid and [HCO3]- values in the three
groups were not altered during the 120 min following
treatment. The base excess (BE) values in the Ns and Hs
groups were not changed at T120 whereas those of the Sb
group were increased. The BE values of the Sb group at
T120 were higher than those of the Ns group. Sodium
bicarbonate improved the BE values (Table 2).
Fluid resuscitation, whether with normal saline, 3.5%
sodium chloride or 5% sodium bicarbonate, did not alter
the Na+, K+, Ca2+ or Cl- levels in any of the three groups.
However, K+ in the Sb group was lower than that in the Ns
group at T120. Blood urea nitrogen was not altered in any
group.
Discussion
The major findings of the present study were: that in
patients with severe sepsis, there were no differences in
CO, MAP, heart rate or respiratory rate between the three
groups during the 120 min trial or the 8 h follow-up; that
there were no significant differences between the Ns
group and the Hs or Sb groups in observed mortality rate
at 28 days; and that sodium bicarbonate improved MAP
and CO more rapidly than normal saline or hypertonic
sodium chloride. However, the benefits of sodium bicar-
bonate were limited.
Previous studies have demonstrated that initial crystalloid
volume loading is valuable in achieving hemodynamic
stability [1-4]. Consistent with previous studies, we
observed the benefits of normal saline during the 120 min
trial, namely MAP rising at T60 and CO increasing at T120.
All 94 patients were treated with crystalloid fluids, but no
vasopressors, inotropic agents, colloids or mechanical
ventilation were administered within the initial two
hours, so the improvement of patient status was certainly

T8h was higher than at T0 in the Hs group; and MAP at T30, T60, T90, T120 and T8h were higher than that at T0 in the Sb group (*p

caused by normal saline perfusion. This indicates that
normal saline can be used for initial volume loading in
severe sepsis.
Small volume hypertonic saline is as effective as large-vol-
ume isotonic crystalloids in expanding plasma volume
and enhancing cardiac output in hemorrhagic shock in
animals [42]. Hypertonic saline increases microcircula-
tory perfusion, presumably by selective arteriolar vasodil-
atation and by decreasing the swelling of red blood cells
and the endothelium [43]. Recent studies demonstrate
that hypertonic saline resuscitation reduces the inflamma-
tory reaction in severe sepsis and septic shock [44-47]. In
experimental sepsis, the hemodynamic responses to
hypertonic saline solution are conflicting: improvement
in rats, dogs and pigs [1], no alteration in horses or
macaques [13,48], and worsening cardiac contractibility
in rabbits [12]. In clinical trials, hypertonic saline with or
without a colloidal solution modifies the hemodynamics
of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Hypertonic saline/
dextran solution improves cardiovascular performance
[5], and hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch results in
increased cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure, but no alteration of O2 metabolism [6]. Muller
reports that 250 ml 7.5% hypertonic saline without col-
loid transiently increases the cardiac index and pulmo-
nary capillary wedge pressure in patients with severe
sepsis during a 120 min trial [7]. There is a difference in
hemodynamic effects between hypertonic saline with col-
loid and hypertonic saline without colloid. We speculate
that the colloid prolongs the effectiveness of the hyper-
tonic solution.
In the present study, 3.5% saline at 5 ml/kg did not alter
the CO of patients during the 120 min trial. The effect of
3.5% sodium chloride was very little different from that of
7.5% sodium chloride in Muller's trial. This might be
attributable to the difference in osmotic pressure between
these two fluids, 1197 mOsm/l in 3.5% sodium chloride
and 2565 mOsm/l in 7.5% sodium chloride solution.
Effects of fluid resuscitation on heart rate in the three groupsFigure 3

There were no differences in heart rate among the groups during the 120 min trial or the 8 h follow-up. Comparing heart rate
in the same group, the heart rate at T8h was lower than that at T0 in the Ns and Sb groups (*p < 0.05), but no change of heart
rate appeared in the Hs group. Resuscitation by fluids did not change heart rate in patients during the 120 min trial.

Sodium bicarbonate was applied empirically by clinicians
before the 1990s in the initial fluid resuscitation of septic
shock [15-18]. However, experimental studies of the effect
of sodium bicarbonate conflicted. Bollaert et al. demon-
strated that sodium bicarbonate treatment does not
reduce metabolic cellular injury in skeletal muscle but fur-
ther reduces MAP in rat models with endotoxic shock
[27]. In our study in rabbits [12], 5% sodium bicarbonate
induced a decrease in MAP and cardiac contractility, and
eventually resulted in the death of the animals. Gossett
reports that in ponies with endotoxemia, hypertonic
sodium bicarbonate infusion causes blood volume expan-
sion, increases blood bicarbonate concentration and lac-
tate concentration, results in hypokalemia, hypernatremia
and hyperosmolality, but does not normalize blood pH
[26]. In contrast, our recent study reports that in
macaques with early-phase endotoxic shock, normal
saline resuscitation further decreases the MAP, cardiac
index, left ventricular work index and right ventricular
work index, whereas macaques given 5% sodium bicarbo-
nate show moderate increases of cardiac index, left ven-
tricular work index and right ventricular work index. Five
percent sodium bicarbonate improves cardiac function in
primate models [13]. The above findings indicate that
there are differences in the effect of sodium bicarbonate
on hemodynamics between primates and non-primates.
The effects of sodium bicarbonate resuscitation in patients
with severe sepsis and early-phase septic shock are consist-
ent with those in macaques [13]. In the present study,
sodium bicarbonate improved MAP and CO more quickly
than normal saline. Sodium bicarbonate manifested a
limited beneficial cardiovascular efficiency during the
early phase of fluid resuscitation in the patients. Compar-
ing the data from the Hs group with those from the Sb
group, a beneficial effect of 5% sodium bicarbonate was
that it improved CO and MAP more quickly than 3.5%
saline.
In clinical investigations, there are minor differences in
the effect of sodium bicarbonate. Mathieu et al. [49]
report that administration of sodium bicarbonate does

tory rate at T8h was lower than that at T0 in the Sb group (*p < 0.05) only; no change of respiratory rate appeared in the Ns
or Hs groups. Resuscitation by fluids did not change the respiratory rate of patients during the 120 min trial.

not improve hemodynamic variables in patients with
metabolic acidosis, nor does it worsen tissue oxygenation.
Cooper [50] found that the MAP responses to sodium
bicarbonate and sodium chloride are the same in patients
with metabolic acidosis. These data have more than 90%
power for detecting a 0.5 l/min difference in mean CO
after administration of sodium bicarbonate or sodium
chloride. In lactic acidosis accompanied by refractory
shock, patients receiving sodium bicarbonate show
improvements in neither acid-base balance nor hemody-
namics [51]. In the present study, MAP and CO improved
more quickly in patients treated with sodium bicarbonate
than in patients treated with normal saline or hypertonic
sodium chloride. The conflict between our data and those
of other authors may be a result of different physiological
status before fluid resuscitation: metabolic acidosis in
Mathieu's papers, moderate hypotension in the present
study and refractory shock in Stacpoole's investigation
[51].
Primates, including humans and macaques, appear to tol-
erate hyperosmotic solutions and acid-alkali balance as
potential treatment for septic shock. The severe side-
effects of hyperosmotic sodium bicarbonate perfusion in
non-primates are hyperosmolarity and hypernatraemia,
raised lactic acid and pH, and altered PaCO2 and [HCO3]-
[52-55]. However, in macaques with early-phase endo-
toxic shock and presenting neither acidosis nor lacticemia,
injection of 5 ml/kg 5% sodium bicarbonate does not
result in increased osmolarity or plasma sodium, or in
altered pH, [HCO3]- or lactic acid 60 min after fluid resus-
citation [13]. Consistent with the investigation of
macaques, patients in the present study with normal pH
(pH = 7.38) and receiving sodium bicarbonate showed
increased BE, decreased K+ but no alteration of pH,
[HCO3]-, lactic acid, Na+, Ca2+ or Cl- during the 120 min
trials. The data in macaques and patients indicate that a
bolus injection of 5 ml/kg sodium bicarbonate did not
affect the acid-basic balance or electrolytes in primates.
Sodium bicarbonate might have the same benefits in
humans and macaques because primates share similar
physiological functions, namely better tolerance to hyper-
tonic solution, volume loading and acid-basic balance
[13,14,18]. Therefore, we consider that a bolus injection
of 5 ml/kg sodium bicarbonate in the initial fluid resusci-
tation of severe sepsis is safe – at least it does not worsen
the physiological signs of the patients – and this treatment
can still be used in cases of severe sepsis and early phase
septic shock in humans, but should be deployed with
care.
The benefits of the three crystalloid solutions were similar
during the 120 min trial and the 8 h follow-up. The MAP
and CO during the initial 120 min did not differ among
the three groups, and their MAPs had recovered at T8h
(>70 mmHg). Also, there was no difference among the
three groups in observed mortality rates. In addition, fluid
resuscitation, whether with normal saline, 3.5% sodium
chloride or 5% sodium bicarbonate, did not alter the
heart or respiratory rate in any group during the subse-
quent 120 min. We consider that all the three fluids may
be used for initial volume loading in severe sepsis and
early-phase septic shock.
Assessments of the severity of organ dysfunction and of
physiological status are critical tools for conducting clini-
cal trials, especially sepsis trials. The APACHEA II score,
SAPS II score, SOFA and the expected mortality rates were
used to judge the severity of patients in previous studies
[56]. In the present study, there were no differences in
APACHEA II score, SAPS II score, SOFA or the expected
mortality rates for APACHE II or SAPS II scores on admis-
sion among the three groups, but the age of the Sb group
was lower than that of the Ns and Hs groups. Thus, similar
pathophysiological scores appeared in the three groups
on admission despite this age difference. In general, the
populations of the three groups were balanced.

Clinical trials emphasize ethical principles. To ensure a
favorable risk-benefit profile, all treatment regimens must
provide efficacy and limited risk, with minimal or no
emergence of organ injury. In the present study, a regimen
was utilized that included a bolus of 5 ml/kg of various
solutions at T0, no vasoactive agents or colloid before T120,
and permitted use of vasoactive agents or colloid for
hemodynamic stability after T120. This design was chosen
for the following reasons. First, crystalloid solutions are
effective as immediate perfusions in initial volume
replacement, but these effects have a short (2–3 h) period
of action [34]. In macaque models, the experiments lasted
for 60 min, during which time sodium bicarbonate
improved myocardial performance and hemodynamics
[13]. In the paper by Chrusch and coworkers on the organ
metabolism of lactate in dogs with sepsis, the experiment
was limited to less than 75 min following fluid resuscita-
tion [57]. Therefore, 120 min duration is suitable for the
study of resuscitation by crystalloid solutions. Second, in
order to investigate the effect of crystalloid solutions on
hemodynamics, vasoactive agents or colloid must not be
administered concurrently with this solution resuscitation
because vasoactive agents may influence cardiovascular
function intensively. But in clinical practice, if fluid resus-
citation does not raise blood pressure and restore hemo-
dynamic stability, vasoactive agents should be used to
improve the patient's physiological status [39]. Finally,
only patients with early-phase septic shock were included
in the investigation. The trial included patients with early-
phase septic shock because they were tolerant of treatment
with single crystalloid solutions within 120 min. The trial
excluded patients with final-phase septic shock, because
they might require vasoactive agents, colloid or other
treatment within 2 h of initial intervention in order to sur-
vive; these patients were therefore not suitable for obser-
vation.
There are limitations to this study.
First, although the patients were randomly assigned to
three groups, the groups were highly heterogeneous in e.g.
age and lactic acid level [see Tables 1 &2]. The imbalance
between groups could not be avoided in a trial that was
conducted over a long period (52 months from Jun 01,
2001 to Oct 31, 2005). Fortunately, there were no signifi-
cant differences in severity scores between the three
groups. Those data indicated that the population was bal-
anced between the three groups. Second, we did not use a
pulmonary artery catheter to measure cardiac output,
mean central venous pressure or pulmonary arterial
wedge pressure, because pulmonary artery catheteriza-
tion, an invasive technique, is not commonly accepted by
patients with early phase septic shock. Therefore, in the
present protocol, CO was measured by color Doppler
echocardiography. Unfortunately, this technique only
analyzed CO; it did not yield essential information about
preload assessment (i.e. pulmonary arterial wedge pres-
sure, ventricular working index), oxygen consumption or
oxygen delivery. Finally, many leukemic cases were
enrolled because those patients were prone to infection,
and hypotension was easily detected in inpatients.
Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated that all three crystalloid
solutions – normal saline, 3.5% hypertonic sodium chlo-
ride and 5% sodium bicarbonate – may be used for initial
volume loading in patients with severe sepsis and hypo-
tension. Sodium bicarbonate improved MAP and CO ear-
lier than normal saline or hypertonic sodium chloride,
which indicates that sodium bicarbonate has a limited
benefit for treating severe sepsis in humans.
