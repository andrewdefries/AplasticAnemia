Hematotoxicity and Carcinogenicity of
Benzene
by Muzaffer Aksoy*
The hematotoxicity of benzene exposure has been well known for a century. Benzene causes leukocytopenia,
thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, etc. The clinical and hematologic picture of aplastic anemia resulting from
benzene exposure is not different from classical aplastic anemia; in some cases, mild bilirubinemia, changes
in osmotic fragility, increase in lactic dehydrogenase and fecal urobilinogen, and occasionally some neuro-
logical abnormalities are found. Electromicroscopic findings in some cases of aplastic anemia with benzene
exposure were similar to those observed by light microscopy. Benzene hepatitis-aplastic anemia syndrome
was observed in a technician with benzene exposure. Ten months after occurrence of hepatitis B, a severe
aplastic anemia developed. The first epidemiologic study proving the leukemogenicity of benzene was per-
formed between 1967 and 1973 to 1974 among shoe workers in Istanbul. The incidence of leukemia was 13.59
per 100,000, which is a significant inorease over that of leukemia in the general population. Following the
prohibition and discontinuation ofthe use ofbenzene in Istanbul, there was a striking decrease in the num-
ber of leukemic shoe workers in Istanbul. In 23.7% ofour series, consisting of59 leukemic patients with ben-
zene exposure, there was a preceding pancytopenic period. Furthermore, a familial connection was found
in 10.2% of them. The 89.8% of our series showed the findings of acute leukemia. The possible factors that
may determine the types of leukemia in benzene toxicity are discussed. The possible role of benzene exposure
is presented in the development of malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and lung cancer.
Introduction
The hematotoxicity of chronic benzene poisoning has
been well known for nearly a century. The effects ofben-
zene include leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia,
transitory leukocytosis, lymphopenia, rarely lymphocy-
tosis, very rarely pseudo-Pelger Huet anomaly changes
in the leukocyte osmotic resistance, decreased phagocytic
function of granulocytes, reduced glucogen content and
inhibited activity ofperoxidase ofneutrophils, an increase
in the acid phosphatase and P-glucoronidase activity of
the neutrophils, and a decrease of alkaline phosphatase,
myeloperoxidase and lipid content of the neutrophils (1).
In addition, in chronic benzene toxicity a decrease of the
Ea and E18 rosetts (T cells) was noted (1). Furthermore,
an increase of leukoagglutinins was demonstrated in the
sera of some workers exposed chronically to benzene. (1).
An increase of eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes in
chronic benzene toxicity is a matter of discussion (1). This
problem, particularly concerning monocytes, deserves
further investigation with modern techniques. In chronic
benzene toxicity, some other qualitative abnormalities,
such as the presence ofgiant platelets, has been found (1).

According to Craveri, the hemorrhagic effects of chronic
benzene toxicity are not solely due to thrombocytopenia
but are also due to increased fibrinolytic activity (2).
Aplastic Anemia or Pancytopenia
Resulting from Chronic Benzene
Exposure
The clinical and hematologic picture of benzene-induced
aplastic anemia which is characterized by pancytopenia,
is not different from that of classical aplastic anemia idio-
pathic or because of different chemicals or other agents
(1). In some cases of benzene-induced aplastic anemia,
there are characteristics that are absent when this
hematologic disorder is caused by other agents, such as
mild bilirubinemia, changes in osmotic fragility, short-
ened erythrocyte survival time, increased serum lactic
dehydrogenase activity, increased fecal urobilinogen, and
mild reticulocytosis (1). These findings are the result of
a hemolytic component in aplastic anemia due to chronic
benzene exposure. Additionally, in some cases of
benzene-mediated aplastic anemia, absolute and relative
lymphocytosis are absent (1). In other words, in addition
to aplastic anemia resulting from other causes, absolute
lymphopenia is present in this hematologic disorder due
to chronic benzene exposure.
M. AKSOY
On the other hand, although there are no symptoms and
findings relating to the nervous system in aplastic ane-
mia, idiopathic or because of different agents, in some
cases of aplastic anemia resulting from chronic exposure
to benzene, there are some findings relating to the ner-
vous system (3). Although as early as 1967 Truhaut has
indicated in his reports on benzene the possibility oflong-
term effects of this chemical agent on the nervous system
such as polyneuritis of the lower extremities, there are
very few reports on this subject (3,4). Baslo and Aksoy
performed neurological, electromyographical, and motor
conduction velocity examinations in six patients with
aplastic anemia and two patients with preleukemia
caused by chronic exposure to benzene (3). In addition,
sensory conduction velocities were measured in three pa-
tients. Neurological abnormalities such as global atrophy
and decreased sensory vibration of lower extremities (in
one case), distal latency lengthening of median nerve (in
one case), decrease in the sensory conduction velocities
of the lower extremities (in one case) were found (3).
There was a certain relationship between the presence
of neurological abnormalities and the period of the ex-
posure.
The findings of bone marrow examination in chronic
benzene toxicity are extremely variable. The picture
i-anges from complete aplasia to highly hyperplastic bone
marrow. In some patients, the bone marrow is fully acel-
lular in the terminal stage (1). According to Mallory et al.
the effects ofbenzene on the bone marrow will vary with
the individual and are independent of the length of ex-
posure (5). More than one type of foci can be encountered
in the bone marrow. Using 3H-methylthymidine autoradi-
ography, Moeschlin and Speck studied the bone marrow
ofanimals poisoned by benzene and found that the results
varied from animal to animal: 4 very hypoplastic, 6
hypoplastic, 5 normocellular, and 4 hypercellular (6). No
correlation was found between cellularity of the bone
marrow and duration of exposure to benzene.
A follow-up study was performed in 44 pancytopenic pa-
tients with chronic benzene toxicity (7). Only 21 patients
had hypocellular bone marrow. It was normocellular in
13 patients and hypercellular in 8. Contrary to the flnd-
ings ofperipheral blood, there was a relationship between
the types of cellularity of the bone marrow and the out-
come, including the development of leukemia. Out of 21
patients with hypocellular bone marrow, 11 died (52.4%),
and in 5 patients (23.8%) leukemia developed later. Con-
trary to this, only 1 out of 13 (7.7%) pancytopenic patients
with normocellular bone marrow died. On the other hand,
4 out of8 patients with hypercellular bone marrow recov-
ered completely (50%). Two died from the complications
of aplastic anemia. In 1 of the remaining 2, leukemia de-
veloped and in the second 8 years after complete recov-
ery, the occurrence of myeloid metaplasia was the cause
of death.
Ultrastructural studies in 4 patients with aplastic ane-
mia and leukocytopenia were performed by Erbengi and
Aksoy (8). Electronmicroscopic findings were in accor-
dance with the changes in the bone marrow observed by
light microscopy. Additionally, there was an increase in
plasma cells with maturation arrest in the later phases
ofthe erythroid series. Ultrastructural studies shed some
light on phagocytic activity of the reticulum cells. This
study showed a hyperactivation in the bone marrow of
one case and a depression in the erythroid elements in the
second patient. These different findings may give the im-
pression that the effect of benzene on the bone marrow
may change from patient to patient.
Benzene-Hepatitis-Aplastic Anemia
Syndrome
The occurrence of aplastic anemia in chronic benzene
toxicity may be accelerated by the occurrence of viral
hepatitis. Recently we have observed a severe case of
aplastic anemia associated with chronic benzene toxicity
10 months after the appearance of hepatitis B. The
propositus was a 32-year-old technician working in a
petroleum plant (1). A sample of the product disclosed
2.2% benzene. Two years ago he had hepatitis B for a du-
ration of 1 month. At that time he was not anemic and
there was no leukocytopenia or hemorrhagic diathesis.
Approximately 10 months later the signs of aplastic ane-
mia appeared. He had severe pancytopenia. The bone
marrow was very hypocellular, and the findings were
consistent with the diagnosis of severe aplastic anemia.
The tests for hepatitis B-virus antigens determined by
ELISA showed that anti-HBs, anti-HBe, and anti-HBc
were positive. The clinical and hematologic picture of the
patient was similar to those of chloramphenicol-hepatitis-
aplastic anemia syndrome first described by Hodgkinson
(9). Following the failure of oxymetholon therapy, a trial
with anti-lymphocytic serum, the patient's clinical and
hematological picture improved considerably. He is in
remission at the present. We call this syndrome
"benzene-hepatitis-aplastic anemia syndrome"(1).
Benzene and Malignancies
Benzene is a suspected leukemogenic and carcinogenic
agent since the first description of a case of leukemia by
Le Noire and Claude in 1897 (10). Recently, Maltoni and
Scarnato showed in rats and mice that oral intake of high
doses of benzene causes malignancies in several tissues
(11). Any agent toxic to pluropotent stem cells can cause
an alteration in two important capabilities of the colony
forming cells (12): self-renewal and differentiation to pro-
duce a variety of lineage restricted progenitor cells, in
other words, the long-term maintenance of self-renewal
and differentiation. Any block or disturbance in these ca-
pabilities will cause either aplastic anemia (a block in self-
renewal) or leukemia (a block in differentiation). There-
fore, benzene as a toxic agent for stem cells, may cause
aplastic anemia or leukemia.
Although there were numerous case reports showing
the possible role ofbenzene in the development ofleuke-
mia, the first epidemiologic study on this problem ap-
peared in 1974 (13). From 1967 to September 1973, 26 pa-
tients with leukemia or pre-leukemia were seen among

28,500 shoe-slipper and handbag workers chronically ex-
posed to benzene in Istanbul. At that time, the concen-
tration of benzene was found to reach a maximum of 210
to 650 ppm during working hours in workplaces. The con-
tent of benzene in adhesives and thinners was between
9% and 88% (7,14). Of these leukemic workers, 17 were
investigated at the Second Internal Clinic of Istanbul
Medical School. The remaining 9 leukemic workers were
studied in other hospitals in Istanbul. As explained in this
study, another worker with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
resulting from benzene exposure was not included in this
series because his profession was different. In 1974, the
number of the leukemic shoe workers in Istanbul in-
creased to 31 (15). Thus the incidence of leukemia among
them was 13.59 per 100,000, which is a markedly and
statistically significant increase over that ofleukemia in
general population, 6 per 100,000.
In Turkey, according to the official Year Book of Health
Statistics, the incidence ofleukemia is between 2.25 and
2.80 per 100,000 (16). As can be seen from Table 1, the
peak incidence among shoe workers in Istanbul occurred
between 1971 and 1973 (17). It was 21.7 per 100,000. The
number of leukemic shoe workers in Istanbul started to
decrease after the prohibition and discontinuation of the
use of benzene since 1969 (17). The number of new leu-
kemic shoe workers has decreased in 1974 to 1975 to the
level of 1969 to 1970, and none were recorded in subse-
quent 3 years. But between 1979 and 1987, we observed
22 new cases of leukemia associated with chronic ex-
posure to benzene. Only 3 of them were shoe workers liv-
ing in Istanbul. The decline in the annual occurrence of
leukemia in the series of shoe workers in Istanbul may
be attributed to the prohibition and gradual discontinu-
ation ofbenzene in this city starting in 1969. On the other
hand, the reappearance of leukemia after 1979 in Istan-
bul and other Turkish cities may be attributed either to
the variation in the interval between the occurrence of
leukemia and exposure or the continued use of materials
containing benzene (17).
The evidence for the use of benzene in Istanbul and
other cities of Turkey following the prohibition of this
chemical is shown in the following study (18). To illustrate
the etiologic role of drugs and chemicals in the develop-
ment of aplastic anemia, we analyzed 108 cases of aplas-
tic anemia among 3175 hematologic patients during a
10-year period (1973-1982) in the hematology section of
the Istanbul Medical School (18). In 25 (23.1%) of the
cases, benzene was responsible for the development of
aplastic anemia. On the other hand, a recent study per-
formed in the period between 1983 and 1985 in Istanbul
and Izmit showed that despite the considerable decrease
in the content of benzene in most of the materials, they
were still above permissible limits (19). During the study
mentioned above we have encountered 2 cases of acute
leukemia in a modern tire cord fabric in Izmit (19). Ap-
proximately 550 workers were employed. The working
conditions were good and properly ventilated. The con-
centration of benzene in one part of the plant was 110
ppm, and in one solvent used in the auxillary repair shop
the benzene content was nearly 5%. The incidence of
leukemia was 60.6 per 100,000 in a period of 6 years.
Development of Leukemia in Pancytopenic
Patients with Chronic Benzene Toxicity
In our series comprising 59 leukemic patients with ben-
zene exposure, a preceding pancytopenic period was pres-
ent in 14 leukemic patients (23.7%) (20). The interval be-
tween the onset of the preceding pancytopenic period and
that of leukemia varied between 6 months and 6 years.
Furthermore, in a follow-up study in 44 pancytopenic pa-
tients with chronic benzene toxicity, leukemia developed
in 6 (13.6%) and myeloid metaplasia in 1 (2.8%) (7).
Familial Connection and Individual
Susceptibility

sociated with chronic benzene exposure, in our series, a

familial connection was established (1,15,21).* Two were
an uncle and his nephew, and 2 were cousins (15). The
father of the fifth leukemic patient, a 65-year-old shoe
worker with a long history of benzene exposure, died in
a hospital with the diagnosis of myelosclerosis, but re-
evaluation of the case report showed that this patient had
acute leukemia of an unidentified type (15). The father of
the seventh patient with chronic benzene exposure also
had the same hematologic malignancy associated with the
use of colchicine and/or saccharin (21). These 6 leukemic
patients among the first- and second-degree relatives con-
stituted 10.2% of the leukemic patients with chronic ex-
posure to benzene.* In these 6 patients including case 7,
the development of leukemia possibly resulted from
simultaneous presence ofgenetic determinants, in addi-
tion to benzene as an extraneous or environmental fac-
tor. This suggestion is in accordance with the view that
leukemia may be caused by the combination ofvarious in-
trinsic and extrinsic factors (22). On the other hand, fam-
ily susceptibility in the development of various disorders
of chronic benzene toxicity suggested by numerous inves-
tigators were evident in our studies concerning benzene
toxicity (1,1 7).
Types of Leukemia in Chronic Benzene
Toxicity
It is evident from the literature that there is a signifi-
cant difference in the distribution of leukemia types
caused by benzene exposure (1,15,20,23). In one group,
acute types of leukemia, mostly myeloblastic or erythro-
blastic, predominate, and in the other chronic leukemia,
myeloid and lymphoid take the most important place. Al-
though in our series, acute leukemia was 89.8%, the per-
centage of chronic types comprising myeloid, lymphoid,
and hairy cell leukemia was 10.2% (20). Considering these
facts we have tried to explain the possible factors that
may determine the types of leukemia in chronic benzene
toxicity (23).
One factor may be the differences in the content ofben-
zene in the material used. The benzene content of the
adhesives and thinners used by workers with acute leuke-
mia in our series was very high (13,15,17,23). In contrast,
it was very low (2.8%) in a worker with chronic lymphoid
leukemia (23). Second, the adhesives and thinners that
were used by nearly all the workers with acute leukemia
contained only benzene (13,15,23). Contrary to this, the
solvent used by a worker with chronic lymphoid leuke-
mia had a low level of benzene and a high percentage of
toluene (23). Third, the great majority of the individuals
with acute leukemia in the series was exposed to high
concentration of benzene ranging between 150 and 210
ppm during all working hours (13,15,23). Contrary to this,
5 out of 6 patients with chronic leukemia, 2 with chronic
myeloid, 2 with chronic lymphoid, and one with hairy cell
*Cases 6 and 8 were not included in this series because one (case 6)
was studied in another hospital and the second (case 8) was not exposed
to benzene (15,21).
leukemia were exposed to benzene intermittently and for
a short time during the daily work. Fourth, the possible
role of genetic factors may help to explain the develop-
ment of different types of leukemia. As can be seen from
Table 2, 6 patients in 3 families had acute types ofleuke-
mia. In the fourth family, despite different extraneous
factors such as chronic benzene exposure and the use of
colchicine and/or saccharin, the same type of leukemia,
namely chronic lymphoid, developed at different ages
(21).
Benzene, Malignant Lymphoma, Multiple
Myeloma, and Lung Cancer
There are a few investigations that suggest a possible
role of benzene in the etiology of malignant lymphoma,
multiple myeloma, and lung cancer. In 1961, Wirtschafter
and Bichell showed that tissue responses could be ob-
served in lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, and bone marrow
of the rat after a single injection of benzene (24). Re-
cently, Irons et al. showed that the effects ofbenzene ad-
ministration in mice on lymphocyte function are at the
doses ofthe compound that produce little or no measura-
ble differences in the number of circulating cells (25). In
1974, we described 6 cases of Hodgkin's disease with
chronic exposure to benzene (26). Despite the lack of
statistical data, we suggested that chronic exposure to
benzene might play a role in the development of Hodg-
kin's disease.
In the last few years we have studied 7 more cases of
different types of malignant lymphoma with benzene ex-
posure (1,17,19). In 1979, Vianna and Polan performed a
comparative study on the mortality rates of different
types ofmalignant lymphoma among workers exposed to
benzene (2?). According to the investigators, their results
are consistent with the possibility that chronic exposure
to benzene might be important in the etiology of malig-
nant lymphoma. A recent study of Norseth et al. is also
in favor of this assumption (28). Furthermore, there are
several studies showing a high mortality rate from differ-
ent types of malignant lymphoma among pathologists,
chemists, and persons handling chemicals containing ben-
zene (29).
Multiple Myeloma
As early as 1970, Torres et al. reported 2 cases of mul-
tiple myeloma with chronic benzene exposure (30). In
1980 and 1984, we described 4 cases ofmultiple myeloma
with chronic benzene exposure (31,32). Only one of these
patients had a short period of pancytopenia with
hypoplastic bone marrow. The mean exposure time to
benzene was longer than that of cases of leukemia and
malignant lymphoma: 18 years in the former and 10.5 in
the latter (1). In an epidemiologic assessment study of
Rinsky et al. in 1987, there was a statistically significant
increase in deaths from leukemia and multiple myeloma
(33).

HEMATOTOXICITY AND CARCINOGENICITY OF BENZENE 197
Lung Cancer
In 1976, we considered 5 individuals with lung cancer
associated with chronic benzene exposure and suggested
that there is a causal relationship between this chemical
and lung cancer (34). In our series ofmalignancies result-
ing from chronic exposure to benzene, there are 7 cases
of lung cancer (1,17). Only 3 showed mild hematologic
findings of chronic benzene toxicity. Because benzene
available in Turkey did not contain benzo[alpyrene deter-
mined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry, lung cancer in
these 7 patients cannot be attributed to this carcinogenic
agent (1,7). Benzene is mainly absorbed via the lungs, and
about 40% of the absorbed portion is exhaled unchanged
(35). After 24 hr, a small percentage of benzene can still
be detected in the expired air (35). Therefore, a carcino-
genic effect of benzene in the lung is possible. Because
our patients were also smokers, a contributory role of
smoking in the development of lung cancer is possible.
