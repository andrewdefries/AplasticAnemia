Pesticides are routinely screened in studies that follow speciﬁc guidelines for possible neuropathogenicity in laboratory animals.
These tests will detect chemicals that are by themselves strong inducers of neuropathogenesis if the tested strain is susceptible
relative to the time of administration and methodology of assessment. Organophosphate induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN)
is the only known human neurodegenerative disease associated with pesticides and the existing study guidelines with hens are a
standard for predicting the potential for organophosphates to cause OPIDN. Although recent data have led to the suggestion that
pesticides may be risk factors for Parkinsonism syndrome, there are no speciﬁc protocols to evaluate this syndrome in the existing
study guidelines. Ideally additional animal models for human neurodegenerative diseases need to be developed and incorporated
into the guidelines to further assure the public that limited exposure to pesticides is not a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases.

INTRODUCTION
In the early 1980s, there was an unfortunate human situ-
ation in which drug abusers developed Parkinsonism syn-
drome [1] following exposure to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-
tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, see Figure 1) that is a by-product
in an attempt to chemically synthesize heroin. Although ear-
lier researchers sought links between manganese exposure
and Parkinsonism [2], the MPTP incident greatly increased
the interest in correlating environmental exposure to con-
taminants and human neurodegenerative diseases. Human
exposure to pesticides is essentially unavoidable in modern
life both in the developed nations and more increasingly in
the developing ones. Worldwide pesticide sales and usage in
both 2000 and 2001 were in excess of ﬁve billion pounds. In
the United States alone there were about 1.2 billion pounds
of pesticides used including insecticides, herbicides, fungi-
cides, rodenticides, but not including wood preservatives,
special biocides, and chlorine/hydrochlorides [3]. Human
exposure to pesticides depends upon many factors and of-
ten agricultural workers have the highest rates of exposure
as they apply pesticides to crops. Spray drift and migra-
tion of the pesticides to potable water as well as residues
in food stuﬀs and residues resulting from home and gar-
den applications are also very signiﬁcant sources of expo-
sure. Many insecticides are neurotoxic by design with tar-
gets being acetylcholinesterase (organophosphates and car-
bamates), the Na+ conductance channel (DDT, pyrethrins,
and pyrethroids), the acetylcholine receptor (nicotinics), the
GABA receptor (emamectin), Ca++ channels (ryanodine),
and some agents such as rotenone that aﬀects mitochondrial
function and also may aﬀect the nervous system. If a poi-
soned individual recovers from the initial toxicity following
a single dose of anticholinesterase inhibitors (with the excep-
tion of some organophosphates) or agents that act on trans-
mitter receptors, and when the chemical is rapidly metabo-
lized and excreted, there is usually no established patholog-
ical or neurodegenerative change although there are many
anecdotal reports of persistent subtle eﬀects (see reference
[4]). The trauma of the acute poisoning incident may have
some psychological eﬀects that may not actually be related
to the neuropharmacology of the agent. The consequences
of chronic exposure to pesticides, whether they are designed
to act on the nervous system as are insecticides or are her-
bicides designed to be speciﬁc for plants, may be causing
eﬀects in humans through their known or yet to be dis-
covered eﬀects in the nervous system. Over the past decade
there has been a growing body of literature that suggests
pesticides as being risk factors either for possibly initiat-
ing or facilitating the progression of neurodegenerative dis-
eases (eg, see Table 1). Theoretically humans may have the
initiation of the diseases triggered by exposure to a pes-
ticide or a pesticide in combination with other environ-
mental contaminants. In some cases, it is possible that in-
dividuals with a genetic predisposition for a neurodegen-
erative disease may be at an increased risk to exposure to

pesticides that might initiate the disease. In other cases where
the initiating event in either normal or genetically suscep-
tible persons is caused by a spontaneous event or another
chemical exposure, the progression following its initiation
may be facilitated to various degrees by exposure to pesti-
cides.
The potential toxicity of pesticides is evaluated in lab-
oratory animals prior to registration and updated in the
reregistration process in a series of required or condition-
ally required studies that follow speciﬁc guidelines [5].
Partly as a consequence of the discovery that MPTP caused
a neurodegenerative disease as well as the interest in the
possibility that there is increased susceptibility associated
with prenatal and neonatal exposures, there has been in-
creased testing as a part of the registration/reregistration pro-
cess to attempt to determine the potential eﬀects of pesti-
cides on the nervous system. As a result, a series of spe-
cial neurotoxicity study guidelines were developed in the
early 1990s. These guidelines for special neurotoxicity test-
ing together with other more general study guidelines that
also assess for eﬀects on the nervous system are listed in
Table 2.
OVERALL GOAL OF THE STUDY GUIDELINES
AND RISK ASSESSMENT
In classical terms, the goal of the study guidelines is to char-
acterize the toxicity of the pesticide and to identify the most
sensitive endpoint in the most sensitive species. Once this
endpoint is selected from the pesticide’s toxicity database
including the required studies following the guidelines in
Table 2, nonguideline studies that are either conducted at the
registrant’s own initiative or as recommended by the USEPA
as well as studies from the open literature, a risk assess-
ment is performed. Traditionally the risk assessment is based
on the no observable adverse eﬀect level (NOAEL) for this
endpoint coupled with available or estimated exposure data.
The NOAEL is adjusted by uncertainty factors to further as-
sure the safety of the chemical to humans. First, a factor of
10 X for intraspecies variation based on the assumption that
within species some individuals may be 10 times more sen-
sitive than the tested group is employed. Another 10 X fac-
tor for interspecies variation based on the assumption that
humans may be 10 times more sensitive than the most sensi-
tive laboratory animal species is also employed. Another 10 X

No
factor may be applied if it is determined that the database is
incomplete or there is no NOAEL for the most sensitive end-
point. When there is an evidence of developmental toxicity
in fetuses or neonatal animals at lower doses than parental or
adult toxicity, an additional FQPA (Food Quality Protection
Act) 10 X (reducible to 3 X or 1 X depending upon the cir-
cumstances) safety factor is applied to assure the protection
of fetuses, newborns, and children. It should be noted that
the application of the uncertainty factors is to the NOAEL
and the lowest observable adverse eﬀect level (LOAEL) is al-
ways higher than the NOAEL. Thus, a total uncertainty fac-
tor of 100 applied to an NOAEL is in reality a factor of 300
from a dose where there is an eﬀect when the LOAEL is a
dose three times higher than the NOAEL. In order to elimi-
nate or compensate for some of the limitations of the NOAEL
and LOAEL approaches, statistical methods have been devel-
oped to determine a benchmark dose (BMD) that accounts
for gaps in dose spacing or account for a study not showing
an NOAEL [6]. The uncertainty factors as described above
(except for not having an NOAEL) are applied to the BMD.
A risk assessment for a chemical with an NOAEL based
on liver toxicity at the LOAEL that has evidence of neu-
ropathogenicity in laboratory animals at higher doses than
at the LOAEL will be protective against the neuropathogen-
esis although neuropathogenicity was not the basis for the
selection of the NOAEL. The protective nature of both the
NOAEL and BMD approaches to risk assessment assumes
that most other potential target organs in humans will only
be aﬀected at higher doses than the most sensitive endpoint
in laboratory animals. If humans are especially susceptible to
neuropathogenesis resulting from exposure to a certain pes-
ticide, the endpoint based on animal studies may underesti-
mate the risk to humans. However, the minimum 100 X un-
certainty factor plus any additional factors would only in rare
cases not be protective against such neuropathogenesis in hu-
mans having extreme sensitivity to the chemical. To date, al-
though this may be debatable by some, there is no known
neuropathological condition caused or facilitated by pesti-
cides that should not be protected against by the current ap-
proach to risk assessment as outlined above provided that the
pesticide does not interact with other environmental con-
taminants, drugs, or naturally occurring chemicals to ren-
der neuropathogenicity. The principle of selecting the most
sensitive endpoint in the most sensitive test animal species
and using either the NOAEL or BMD and applying uncer-
tainty factors to drive down exposure is still the basis for risk

assessment although some may consider this principle out-
dated. The toxicity database as generated by the required
studies is intended to be a thorough screening process and
is not intended to be an in-depth assessment of any organ
including the nervous system unless special inclusions are
made. However, when there are justiﬁcations to believe that
the toxicity for a given chemical is being underestimated by
the standard set of required toxicity studies, and validated
methods for additional testing are available, these additional
studies can be recommended to further characterize the tox-
icity.
An inherent problem with the guidelines for neurotoxic-
ity studies is that the rat, dog, mouse, or rabbit may not pro-
vide a model for certain types of neurotoxicity that humans
may be especially sensitive to. No matter how much testing
is done in animals, such toxicity will not be detected prior
to exposure to humans. The case of aplastic anemia is one
example of there not being an animal model for prediction
of a particular type of toxicity. It is estimated that one per-
son in 30–40,000 is susceptible to the aplastic anemia caused
by the antibiotic chloramphenicol [7]. There might also be
cases of unusual human susceptibility to a neuropathogen of
similar low frequency and there would be no way to detect
them using the current battery of studies. Unlike the chlo-
ramphenicol model where the dosage was intentional and
monitored, exposure to pesticides is much smaller and the
actual amounts, times, and frequencies of pesticide exposure
are not known.
The guidelines (Table 2) for the more general acute
(870.1100 for oral, 870.1200 for dermal, and 870.1300
for inhalation), subchronic (870.3100 for rodents and
870.3150 for nonrodents—usually dogs), prenatal develop-
ment (870.6300) and reproductive (870.3800) and chronic
toxicity in rats and dogs (870.4100) and carcinogenicity in
rats and mice (870.4200 or 870.4300) are nonspeciﬁc in their
description of methods recommended for evaluation of the
histopathology of the nervous system. The more obvious
neurotoxicity would be detected by observation of the be-
havior of the animals based on daily cage-side evaluations if
the technical staﬀ is appropriately trained to look for and de-
tect changes in behavior. The only instructions in the nona-
cute studies for histopathology preparation apply to all tis-
sues and are not speciﬁc for nerve tissue: “tissues and organs
designated for microscopic examination should be ﬁxed in
10 percent buﬀered formalin or a recognized suitable ﬁxative
as soon as necropsy is performed and no less than 48 hours
prior to trimming.” No commentary on the special stains
to be used is provided. Hematoxylin and eosin are routinely
used.
SPECIAL STUDIES FOR ASSESSMENT
OF NEUROTOXICITY IN RATS
The studies designed for speciﬁc assessment of potential
neurotoxicity in rats include the series 870.6200 for acute
and subchronic screening in adults and 870.6300 for de-
velopmental neurotoxicity (DNT). The latter study includes
exposure to pups in utero and during lactation either via
lactation or by direct gavage exposure to the pups. These
studies include cage-side observations for the more obvious
clinical signs and for functional observational battery (FOB)1
which assess the animal for motor and sensory eﬀects. The
technical staﬀ making these observations is supposed to be
especially trained to detect subtle changes in clinical signs
indicative of neurotoxicity and typically is unaware whether
the animal was dosed with the test material or otherwise. For
these studies, the instructions for histopathological evalua-
tion of the nervous system are more speciﬁc than for the gen-
eral screening studies. “Tissues should be prepared for histo-
logical analysis using in situ perfusion and paraﬃn and/or
plastic embedding procedures. Paraﬃn embedding is accept-
able for tissues from the central nervous system. Plastic em-
bedding of tissue samples from the central nervous system is
encouraged, when feasible. Plastic embedding is required for
tissue samples from the peripheral nervous system. Subject to
professional judgment and the type of neuropathological al-
terations observed, it is recommended that additional meth-
ods such as Bodian’s and Bielchowsly’s(sic) silver methods,
and/or glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohisto-
chemistry be used in conjunction with more standard stains
to determine the lowest dose level in which neuropathologi-
cal alterations are observed.”
In the developmental neurotoxicity study (870.6300),
pups (11 or 21 day old depending on the length of lactational
exposure) and adults (about 62 days old) derived from dams
exposed to the pesticide from day 6 of gestation through
lactation (at least to day 10 but many laboratories continue
dosing up to the time of parturition) via lactation or by di-
rect gavage dosing during the lactation period are examined
histologically. In addition to histopathology, an abbreviated
FOB assessment, learning and memory and motor activity
and acoustic startle responses are all evaluated in the pups
at about weaning time and again as young (about 60 days)
adults. Histology of pups is diﬀerent from the 870.6200 stud-
ies in that the brain is ﬁxed by immersion rather than in situ.
The guidelines for the neurotoxicity screening studies and
the developmental neurotoxicity study provide references for
more detailed instructions for histopathology and behavior
assessments. The laboratory conducting the study is respon-
sible for selecting the techniques and stains to be used.
Positive control studies such as with trimethyl tin or acry-
lamide for neurohistopathology as well as positive controls
such as amphetamine and haloperidol for motor activity and
scopolamine for learning and memory are currently recom-
mended to assure the susceptibility of the strain and the com-
petence of the laboratory personnel conducting the study.
The argument for also considering nonchemical agents to
evaluate the proﬁciency of a laboratory in the use of a test
(eg, memory) has been made [8].
These screening studies should detect alterations of the
nervous system that occur within the limited time frames of
testing with respect to the age of the rat when tested provided
that the relatively pure strains of rat used are susceptible to

any neurotoxicity that could be induced by the chemical.
Consequently there are limitations with regard to their pre-
dictive value for the major neurodegenerative diseases which
are associated with older humans such as Parkinson’s and
Alzheimer’s. In particular, only young adults are assessed in
the 870.6200 screening studies and exposure to the rats is
in utero and up to the ﬁrst three weeks of life in the se-
ries 870.6300 developmental neurotoxicity study. The rats
are not kept on the study to determine if the in utero expo-
sure predisposed them to development of neuropathological
conditions in the later stages of life or if a challenge by the
test chemical would be worse if the rats were not exposed in
utero.
Three other studies (870.6500, scheduled operant be-
havior, 870.6850, peripheral nerve function, and 870.6855,
neurophysiology: sensory evoked potentials) are rarely con-
ducted but can be used to further characterize indications
of neurotoxicity suggested in either the general or the spe-
cial neurotoxicity guideline studies or based on the pesticide’s
structure and predicted activity relationships.
There are no guidelines for studies with monkeys which
may have a similar level of susceptibility to neurotoxicants
that may produce or facilitate human neuropathogenesis.
Reasons for this are that studies with monkeys are expensive
and only limited numbers of animals can be used.
NONGUIDELINE STUDIES
Studies from the open literature or studies conducted by the
pesticide industry that either do not have protocols consis-
tent with the guidelines or that are conducted to address a
speciﬁc question are grouped together as nonguideline stud-
ies. Such nonguideline studies can provide endpoints for risk
assessment when peer review determines that they are of ac-
ceptable scientiﬁc merit. It is, however, diﬃcult to request
that companies conduct special nonguideline studies with-
out suﬃcient justiﬁcation that the study is validated to ren-
der data useful for risk assessment purposes.
A recurring problem with nonguideline studies is that
they often use routes of test chemical administration not re-
lated to human exposure scenarios. Intraperitoneal, intra-
venous, and intramuscular modes of administration may
be very useful in attempting to determine the mode of ac-
tion of a chemical. Such data are important in understand-
ing the possible molecular basis for the neuropathogenesis.
However, extrapolating data from these routes of administra-
tion to human exposure by the dietary, dermal, or inhalation
routes is problematic.
The use of nonguideline studies with purposeful dosing
of human volunteers to assist in the risk assessment for pesti-
cides is done on a case by case basis following both scientiﬁc
and ethical review. Such studies with human volunteers are
occasionally conducted with pesticides that may cause tran-
sitory eﬀects such as cholinesterase inhibition but certainly
not to see if a neurodegenerative condition results. Epidemi-
ological studies that attempt to correlate the incidence of cer-
tain types of diseases with pesticide exposure to humans de-
rived from surveys of the subjects’ personal history provide
insight into the possibility that exposure to the pesticide may
be related to the onset and progression of neuropathogenesis.
These studies, however, can only suggest a possible relation-
ship because the subjects are also simultaneously exposed to
many other chemicals and there is no real way to determine
the actual extent to which the subjects were exposed to the
suspect pesticide chemical or if exposure occurred during the
critical times to aﬀect the onset or progression of the neu-
ropathological condition.
STUDY GUIDELINES FOR ASSESSING
ORGANOPHOSPHATE-INDUCED
DELAYED NEUROPATHY
The only established neuropathy in humans associated with
pesticides is organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy
(OPIDN) caused by certain but not all organophosphate in-
secticides and some other organophosphates not used as in-
secticides. A recent review on OPIDN provides more detailed
information on the history and development of this model
[9]. Documentation that OPIDN aﬀects humans dates back
to the early part of the last century when a major incident oc-
curred during the prohibition years in the USA as a result of
consumption of a Jamaican ginger alcoholic drink that was
later demonstrated to be contaminated with tolyl phosphate
esters. It is estimated that some 20,000 persons were aﬀected
to various degrees with a syndrome that was called Ginger
jake paralysis or jake leg. The classical work of M. Smith and
R.D. Lillie [10] of the US Public Health Service in the 1920s
and 30s demonstrated that the phosphate contaminants were
responsible for the condition and could reproduce the syn-
drome in rabbits, dogs, monkeys, and calves. In human ex-
posure to ginger jake, the condition was described as “the ini-
tial ﬂaccidity, characterized by muscle weakness in the arms
and legs giving rise to a clumsy, shuﬄing gait, was replaced
by spasticity, hypertonicity, hyperreﬂexia, clonus, and abnor-
mal reﬂexes, indicative of damage to the pyramidal tracts
and a permanent upper-motor neuron syndrome. In many
patients, recovery was limited to the arms and hands and
damage to the lower extremities (foot drop spasticity and
hyperactive reﬂexes) was permanent, suggesting damage to
the spinal cord” [4]. Validation that organophosphate insec-
ticides cause OPIDN in humans comes partly from an inci-
dent concerning workers manufacturing the insecticide mi-
pafox following an accident [11]. Domestic animals are also
susceptible to OPIDN as indicated by the poisoning of water
buﬀalo in Egypt [12] by the insecticide leptophos. A review
of the possible association between leptophos with OPIDN in
humans [13] describes problems in distinguishing between
leptophos and other contaminants as the cause of OPIDN.
Considerable research on the structure of organophos-
phate insecticides that can cause this neuropathy has been
done [9]. Of the tolyl phosphate contaminants in the ginger
product, it was later determined that only one, the ortho-
isomer, was responsible for the toxicity, indicating the highly
speciﬁc chemical structural nature of the induction of this
syndrome. Figure 1 presents some of the chemical struc-
tures of organophosphates that are known to cause OPIDN.
8 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
Research on biochemical approaches has led to the discovery
that inhibition of “neuropathy target esterase” (NTE) by the
organophosphates that cause the delayed-type neuropathy
has provided a basis for screening of new organophosphate
candidates for development as insecticides [14]. Chemicals
showing higher levels of inhibition of NTE are reported to
have a good correlation with development of OPIDN.
The hen was determined to be a relatively very suscep-
tible species but the laboratory rat and mouse were not ap-
preciably susceptible to OPIDN. The hen provides a model
for assessing the potential for an organophosphate to cause
neurotoxicity and is used in the acute and repeat dose study
guidelines (870.6100). It is necessary to use adult domestic
hens 8–14 months of age since the chick has a lower sensi-
tivity [15]. In the acute study, a near lethal dose is admin-
istered usually by gavage and the hen may be protected by
atropine from the inhibitory eﬀects of the organophosphate
on acetylcholinesterase. Following dosing, the hens are ob-
served for their gait characteristics including the ability to
walk up an incline and after 21 days are sacriﬁced and ex-
amined histologically. The repeat dose study is conducted
when there is an evidence of OPIDN in the acute study or
when there is an evidence of inhibition of NTE. The focus
of the repeat dose study is to determine the NOAEL and
LOAEL for OPIDN and it includes control, low, mid, and
high (maximum 1 gm/kg) doses. The guidelines provide the
following details for histopathological examination of the
nervous system. “Tissues should be ﬁxed by whole body per-
fusion, with a ﬁxative appropriate for the embedding me-
dia. Sections should include medulla oblongata, spinal cord,
and peripheral nerves. The spinal cord sections should be
taken from the rostral cervical, the midthoracic, and the lum-
bosacral regions. Sections of the proximal regions of both of
the tibial nerves and their branches should be taken. Sections
should be stained with appropriate myelin- and axon-speciﬁc
stains.” The guidelines recommend that TOCP (tri-ortho-
cresyl phosphate, Figure 1) be used as a positive control to
assure the susceptibility of the hens. Not all hens are equally
susceptible to OPIDN [16].
No new organophosphate insecticides have been intro-
duced in recent years and either organophosphate insecti-
cides that were demonstrated to cause OPIDN have been
phased out or their uses have been greatly restricted. New
organophosphates, however, may in the future be needed for
control of certain pests that become resistant to currently
registered pesticides. OPIDN is not considered to be related
to another known human neurodegenerative disease. How-
ever, the OPIDN model may be very useful in studying the
progressive degeneration of the nervous system following
initiation of the nerve degeneration that may be applied to
human neurodegenerative diseases if the underlying mecha-
nisms of OPIDN can be elucidated and compared with hu-
man diseases.
PESTICIDES AND PARKINSONISM SYNDROME
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is regarded as the second most
common neurodegenerative disorder in humans and aﬀects
about 2% of the population over the age of 60 years. Clin-
ically, PD is a disorder of motor function characterized by
tremor, slow and decreased movement (bradykinesia), mus-
cular rigidity, poor balance, and problems in gait [17]. Patho-
logically, PD patients show loss of dopaminergic neurons
in the substantia nigra pars compacta and frequently have
Lewy bodies, eosinophilic intracellular inclusions composed
of amyloid-like ﬁbers and α-synuclein [18]. PD may have a
genetic basis for susceptibility for an early onset form but the
occurrence of the more prevalent late onset form does not
have an established genetic basis [19]. The latter form may
result from a multitude of diﬀerent factors including insults
from xenobiotics and an individual’s inherent sensitivity or
diﬀerences in the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the
xenobiotics. Since the discovery that MPTP [1] could cause
PD like syndrome, interest in the herbicide paraquat, which
has some structural similarity to MPTP (Figure 1) led to the
possibility that this herbicide could be a risk factor in the PD
syndrome [20–25]. Factors such as exposure from living in
rural areas, farming, drinking water from wells and exposure
to agricultural chemicals have been investigated and claimed
as support for an association between paraquat and increased
PD. Interest in the herbicide maneb as a possible risk factor
for PD developed because of its reported eﬀects on dopamine
whereas it was demonstrated to enhance the eﬀects of the ac-
tive metabolite of MPTP or MPP+ [26, 27]. Rotenone, a pes-
ticide that is an inhibitor of mitochondrial Complex I func-
tion, has also been implicated for being associated with PD
based partly on work that associates the mode of action of
MPTP or its principal metabolite MPP+ with an eﬀect on
mitochondrial Complex I function [28–30].
Organochlorine insecticides as well as tricyclohexyl and
triphenyl tin inhibit various ATPases in nerve membranes
including one enzyme species that also shows a bell-shaped
curve for activation and then inhibition of activity by Mn++
and it was earlier suggested [31] that inhibition of ATPases
might be related to an environmental factor in Parkinson’s
disease etiology. DDT and dieldrin persist in the body and
once ingested can remain there indeﬁnitely. Mobilization of
DDT or dieldrin from fat stores as the body ages to critical ar-
eas associated with PD might be a factor in its development
or progression. An association between dieldrin presence and
PD syndrome [32] was reported based on a small number of
patients examined. Heptachlor has also been demonstrated
to aﬀect dopamine function [33] in laboratory animals.
The association between PD and pesticides is a contro-
versial issue and the USEPA does not currently consider that
pesticides are risk factors in this disease. A recent compre-
hensive review of this issue, supported in part by industry
but published in a peer reviewed journal, led the authors to
conclude “that animal and epidemiological data reviewed do
not provide suﬃcient evidence to support a causal associa-
tion between pesticide exposure and PD” [43].
If a pesticide was causing or aﬀecting a PD like syndrome
in susceptible laboratory animals, the signs of tremor, slow
and decreased movement, muscular rigidity, problems in gait
would be expected to be detected in the screening process if
all of the appropriate studies were requested and conducted.
John D. Doherty 9
The available studies for paraquat, maneb, or rotenone do
not show obvious indications of these signs at least not at
their LOAELs in the strains tested. The histopathological ef-
fects would probably not be so obvious within the limited as-
sessment for histopathology in the current study guidelines
since the substantia nigra is a relatively small section of the
brain and would require special assessment to determine if
there were test chemical induced changes in the dopamine
dependent cells within it. Chronic exposure for paraquat is
currently based on “chronic pneumonitis” in dogs with a
conventional 100 fold uncertainty factor. Maneb is currently
regulated for chronic exposure based on its eﬀects on the thy-
roid in rats at the LOAEL plus a 1000 fold uncertainty factor
including an extra 10 X because of an incomplete database.
Endpoints for rotenone are currently being reevaluated and
the reports of its association with PD syndrome being con-
sidered for future testing but the current LOAEL is not based
on indications of neuropathogenesis.
Historically, the rat has limitations as an in vivo model
for PD and attempts to study the eﬀects of either Mn++ or
MPTP in this species resulted with some but limited data. A
detailed review of the development of animal models for PD
and other neurodegenerative diseases is beyond the scope of
this review and there are no suitable models for incorpora-
tion into the guidelines. Reviews of neurotoxicant induced
models of PD in the rat have been published recently in 2004
[44] and 2005 [45] and provide comprehensive discussions
of the many problems associated with trying to develop an
animal model. A review of the development of animal mod-
els in mice has also been presented [46] and limitations of
this species including genetically engineered strains are dis-
cussed [47]. Factors such as the low susceptibility of rodents
to PD like syndrome or a narrow or limited vulnerable age
or the diﬀerences in metabolism and access to the critical
sites by the critical form of the toxic agents as well as the cu-
mulative eﬀects and the inﬂuence of combinations of chem-
icals all contribute to problems in developing animal models
for predicting a chemical’s potential to be a risk factor for
PD.
One important consideration in the development of an-
imal models for PD concerns the question: what is the goal
of the model? For example, some models are developed to
further understand the neurochemical events associated with
the initiation and progression of the disease in order to de-
velop therapy. Other models may have the goal of establish-
ing a basis for risk assessment. One of the criticisms of some
of the developing models that they do not mimic the dis-
ease in humans closely enough is not necessarily detrimental
to the goal of providing data for risk assessment. This is be-
cause if the model shows an eﬀect suggestive at all of neu-
ropathogenesis it would be important in the hazard char-
acterization of the chemical. Thus, genetically manipulated
mice that spontaneously develop PD like syndrome whether
it mimics the human condition exactly or not would be an
important addition to the guidelines. The suspect chemicals
could be tested in these strains to see if the spontaneous rates
of the syndrome are increased, occur at an earlier onset time,
or are worse in the presence of the pesticides.
In vitro data using rat or other animal tissue preparations
can be very useful for providing data on mechanisms but not
always generalize to the in vivo situation. One such exam-
ple is the eﬀect of paraquat which was suspected as caus-
ing PD like syndrome based on its structural similarity to
MPTP/MPP+ that does not have the same aﬃnity for the
dopamine transporter or cause inhibition of mitochondrial
complex I in in vitro studies indicating that paraquat has as
eﬀect on dopamine neurons that is unique from rotenone
and MPTP [48]. It is still possible that an NTE like model
such as for predicting OPIDN could be developed based on
in vitro studies. Limitations associated with in vitro models
based on animal tissue include that in real life, exposure is
not just to the single chemical but to complex mixtures, in
vitro studies do not reﬂect the cumulative eﬀects of the pes-
ticide or the temporal aspects of the initiation or progression
of the disease.
Another animal model for induction of PD involves mice
and their early exposure and later challenge based on work
with paraquat and maneb [49]. The mice exposed as fetuses
during pregnancy were reported to be more susceptible to
indications of PD when challenged later in life by these pes-
ticides. This implied that an initial injury predisposed the
animals to susceptibility in later stages of life. This model is
based on the “Barker hypothesis” or its expanded form for
Parkinsonism where it is postulated [50] that early exposure
to chemicals destroys certain critical cells in the substantia
nigra to levels below those needed to sustain function asso-
ciated with advancing age. In these studies, combinations of
paraquat and maneb were used assessing the mutual inﬂu-
ence of each. The role of early life environmental risk factors
in PD has been independently reviewed [51].
As indicated above, a problem with attempting to assess
for the eﬀects of pesticides as risk factors of neuropatho-
genesis by the study guidelines is that some of the literature
reports associating pesticides with PD imply that combina-
tions of pesticides or other agents rather than the individual
pesticides are the risk factors. Extensive justiﬁcation would
be needed before studies with combinations of xenobiotics
could be requested to provide data for risk assessment. Es-
tablishing what combinations of chemicals should be tested,
how long the tests should run for and what relative doses of
each chemical to be tested would be a task in itself and inter-
preting the data with regard to which chemical is really the
contributing factor would be problematic.
OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS
Table 1 lists Alzheimer’s disease (the most common neurode-
generative disease), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, autism and
psychiatric disorders as possibly being related to pesticide
exposure. Tests for learning and memory through the life
cycle including the later months near study termination in
chronic or cancer studies might be considered for incorpo-
ration into the guidelines to attempt to assess for at least
some aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease may
have both genetic and environmental factors [52] and ani-
mal models of Alzheimer’s disease are being developed [53]
10 Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology
but their usefulness for evaluating risk associated with pes-
ticide exposure has not been established. Many factors may
inﬂuence the progression of Alzheimer’s disease and a very
recent report indicates that persons with higher levels of ed-
ucation have faster rates of cognitive decline [54]. Animal
models of autism are being developed [55] and the endpoints
of (i) lower sensitivity to pain and higher sensitivity to non-
painful stimuli, (ii) diminished acoustic prepulse inhibition,
(iii) locomotor and repetitive/stereotypic-like hyperactivity
combined with lower exploratory activity, and (iv) decreased
number of social behaviors and increased latency to social
behaviors are considered possible indicators of a drugs as-
sociation with autism based on studies with valproic acid.
The developmental neurotoxicity study (DNT, 870.6300) can
assess for some of these parameters but there are no inclu-
sions in the current guidelines for DNT studies for assessing
social behaviors. If a pesticide caused neurological or mus-
cular degeneration, it could possibly aggravate amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis but would be regulated based on its NOAEL
to be protective. Although neuropsychiatric disorders may
not be strictly within the description of neurodegenerative
disease, there has been a continuous debate over the pos-
sibility that organophosphate poisoning causes neuropsy-
chiatric sequella [40]. A review of this topic is beyond the
scope of this manuscript. Nonguideline studies with mon-
keys [41] with sarin have been reported to produce long-
lasting EEG changes that are claimed to conﬁrm an earlier
observation of changes in the human EEG patterns [42] fol-
lowing organophosphate exposure. The persons exposed to
sarin (a potent cholinesterase inhibitor) gas in the Tokyo
subway incident in the mid 1990s have been assessed peri-
odically and reports indicate possible neurological eﬀects ei-
ther related to the gas itself of post traumatic stress disorder
[56–58].
OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF NEUROTOXICITY STUDY
GUIDELINES FOR CHARACTERIZING RISK
FOR NEUROPATHOGENICITY
Strength of the neurotoxicity study guidelines. The neurotox-
icity study guidelines provide a screening procedure that
should detect pesticides that are strong inducers of neu-
ropathogenesis in the animal strains and species tested rel-
ative to the time of administration and ages of the tested
animals. The guidelines are adaptable and as more and bet-
ter techniques and models (such as genetically manipulated
strains) are developed these models can be incorporated into
the guidelines. Humans would have to be inherently espe-
cially more sensitive to a neuropathological response to a pes-
ticide or there would have to be other contributing factors
from the real world if they were to develop neuropathological
conditions as a result of the low level of exposure that is set by
the selection of the most sensitive endpoint in the most sen-
sitive species as determined by the battery of required studies
and other available data and the application of uncertainty
factors to drive down exposure.
Weaknesses or limitations of the study guidelines. Several
inherent weaknesses in the study guidelines can be identiﬁed.
Most of these reﬂect a disparity between the stringent con-
ditions of laboratory testing and real world exposure. These
include the following.
(i) Pesticides are tested individually. Thus, the interaction
and cumulative eﬀects of the individual pesticide with the
many other pesticides, xenobiotics, drugs, and natural food-
stuﬀs are not assessed.
(ii) Relatively pure strains of standardized laboratory an-
imals are tested meaning that a neuropathological condition
will be detected only if that particular strain is sensitive to the
chemical. The human population is very diverse with varying
degrees of sensitivity to a given chemical. The standardized
strains do not have a predisposition to develop neuropatho-
genesis such that it cannot be assessed if there is a poten-
tial for the pesticide to accelerate the progression of a neu-
ropathological condition once started.
(iii) Healthy young animals on diets optimized for their
health would be the least susceptible to a toxic insult are used
for testing. There is a wide variation in diet and disparity in
ages and in the level of health that makes humans possibly
more susceptible.
(iv) Temporal conditions are not fully evaluated such as
early in utero and fetal exposure aﬀecting the animal to be
more sensitive to an insult by the chemical in the later phases
of its life.
(v) Neuropathogenesis may result from the destruction
of only a very small structure of the brain (ie, the pars com-
pacta of the substantia nigra) and such changes in structure
may be missed in routine histopathological assessment of the
brain. This is an important concept since the laboratory an-
imal may have a higher tolerance to destruction of the brain
area than the human and the animal may not show clinical
signs until there is a major destruction but the human may
show clinical signs after only minimal or moderate destruc-
tion.
(vi) Laboratory animals are not the same as humans. De-
tection of neuropathogenesis in animals does not mean that
the human will develop the same lesion. Conversely, failure
of animals to develop a neuropathological condition does not
mean that the human will.
All of the factors above for weaknesses or limitations ap-
ply in to the study guidelines in general such as for assessing
for cancer and developmental toxicity and these limitations
are well recognized. In essence, studies conducted following
the guidelines, as imperfect as they may be, plus other avail-
able data are what risk assessments are based on. Epidemio-
logical data come later.
SUMMARY
Pesticides are individually tested in a series of studies with
established guidelines with laboratory animals to determine
if they have the potential for neuropathogenicity. Thus, the
neuropathological eﬀects of chemicals that are strong induc-
ers of neuropathogenesis in the species of animals tested and
if tested at the critical susceptible times will be detected in
the battery of studies required for registration and reregis-
tration. Additional testing in animals can be conducted based
John D. Doherty 11
on suggestions of neuropathogenesis from existing studies or
based on structure activity relationships to further charac-
terize a neuropathological condition possibly associated with
the pesticide. Currently, the endpoints determined by the
completed battery of required and other studies and the use
of uncertainty factors in risk assessment are designed to pro-
vide a reasonable protection against possible neuropathogen-
esis of pesticides to humans. If humans are uniquely suscep-
tible or the timing for test chemical administration in the
animal studies is not appropriate, or if the pesticide must
interact with other chemicals, potential eﬀects in humans
could be missed but the inclusion of the uncertainty factors
is designed to protect against such possibilities by driving
down exposure. The discovery that humans are susceptible to
OPIDN resulted from accidental exposure to an organophos-
phate led to the development of the hen model for OPIDN
testing which is the only model for neuropathy that is pur-
posefully assessed for in routine screening studies. Had this
accident not happened, there might be an occasional incident
of persons developing the OPIDN syndrome today without
knowing its cause. The OPIDN model is unlike the major
human neurodegenerative diseases since OPIDN starts soon
after exposure while Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s may require
long intervals between exposures and onset or they may re-
quire a natural onset before pesticides can facilitate their pro-
gression. Therefore, the possibility that pesticide exposures
can be risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases needs to
be considered in epidemiological models, whether alone or
in combination with other factors. Development of animal
models to more completely assess for possible relationships
between pesticide exposure and neurodegeneration in hu-
mans need to be developed and validated to render data use-
ful for risk assessment. Animal models with strains genet-
ically engineered to be susceptible to known human neu-
rodegenerative diseases may eventually be developed and val-
idated and be important additions to the guidelines for neu-
rotoxicity assessment.
