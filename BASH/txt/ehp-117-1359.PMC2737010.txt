Review
Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is
a potent insecticide that was used worldwide
for agricultural and public health purposes
from the 1940s until the 1970s, when concern
about its toxic effects on wildlife and humans,
its environmental persistence, and its concen-
tration in the food supply led to restrictions
and prohibitions on its use [Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)
2002]. Commercial mixtures, often called
technical-grade DDT, contain two major iso-
mers, the active ingredient, p,p´‑DDT, and a
by-product, o,p´‑DDT. DDT and its primary
breakdown product, dichlorodiphenyldichloro­
ethylene (DDE), are highly lipophilic, per-
sist in the environment, and bioaccumulate in
humans because of their long half-lives (6 years
and possibly up to 10 years, respectively)
(Longnecker 2005; Wolff et al. 2000).
DDT was identified as a potent insecticide
in 1939 and was heavily used during World
War II. After the war, DDT became the global
insecticide of choice in households, for agri-
culture, and for public health vector-control
projects. In 1962, Rachel Carson, in Silent
Spring, noted that DDT bioaccumulates and
biomagnifies up the food chain and raised con-
cerns that the pesticide may have long-lasting
effects on wildlife and possibly on humans
(Carson 1962).
In the United States, all nonpublic health
uses of DDT were banned by 1972. Regulation
by some other nations occurred more gradu-
ally. DDT continues to be used for malaria
control in several African and Asian countries
(Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic
Pollutants 2008). In 2001, more than 100
countries signed the Stockholm Convention
on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), com-
mitting to eliminate the use of 12 POPs of
greatest concern to the health of the global
community, including DDT (United Nations
Environment Programme 2001). By 2008,
160 countries had ratified the Stockholm
Convention, making it one of the most suc-
cessful inter­national environmental agreements
(Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic
Pollutants 2008). Recognizing the continued
need for DDT use in some countries, the con-
vention allows the production and use of DDT
for disease vector control only, provided that
no safe, effective, and affordable alternatives
are locally available. In these cases, the conven-
tion requires parties to notify the convention
secretariat of their intention to produce and/
or use DDT for vector control and to prevent
or minimize human exposure and release into
the environment. In 2006, the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) endorsed
indoor DDT spraying to control malaria
(WHO 2006).
On 14 March 2008, researchers met
for the Eugene Kenaga International DDT
Conference, which was jointly organized by
the Pine River Superfund Citizen Task Force,
the Center for Responsible Leadership, and
the Public Affairs Institute of Alma College
with the endorsement of the International
Society of Environmental Epidemiology,
the Society for Environmental Toxicology
and Chemistry, Alma College, and the Pine
River Superfund Task Force. The goal of the
conference was to bring together experts on
DDT and concerned citizens to address the
current and legacy implications of DDT pro-
duction and use. This conference was held

Objectives: Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was used worldwide until the 1970s, when
concerns about its toxic effects, its environmental persistence, and its concentration in the food sup-
ply led to use restrictions and prohibitions. In 2001, more than 100 countries signed the Stockholm
Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), committing to eliminate the use of 12 POPs
of greatest concern. However, DDT use was allowed for disease vector control. In 2006, the World
Health Organization and the U.S. Agency for International Development endorsed indoor DDT
spraying to control malaria. To better inform current policy, we reviewed epidemiologic studies
published from 2003 to 2008 that investigated the human health consequences of DDT and/or
DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) exposure.
Data sources and extraction: We conducted a PubMed search in October 2008 and retrieved
494 studies.
Data synthesis: Use restrictions have been successful in lowering human exposure to DDT, but
blood concentrations of DDT and DDE are high in countries where DDT is currently being used
or was more recently restricted. The recent literature shows a growing body of evidence that expo-
sure to DDT and its breakdown product DDE may be associated with adverse health outcomes
such as breast cancer, diabetes, decreased semen quality, spontaneous abortion, and impaired neuro­
development in children.
Conclusions: Although we provide evidence to suggest that DDT and DDE may pose a risk to
human health, we also highlight the lack of knowledge about human exposure and health effects in
communities where DDT is currently being sprayed for malaria control. We recommend research
to address this gap and to develop safe and effective alternatives to DDT.

The purpose of this review is to summa-
rize information on health risks so as to bet-
ter inform risk–benefit analyses and policy.
We do so by reviewing evidence of human
exposure to DDT and some of its potential
health consequences, focusing primarily on
studies that have been published since the
endorsement of DDT by WHO and USAID
and since the publication of other literature
reviews on the subject (Longnecker 2005;
Rogan and Chen 2005). We conducted
a search of PubMed (National Library of
Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA) to find
human studies (excluding case reports) pub-
lished in English from 2003 to 2008 by using
the following search terms: (DDT OR DDE)
AND (toxicity OR health OR cancer OR car-
cinogenicity OR reproduction OR estrogen
OR neurological OR development OR expo-
sure OR diabetes OR pregnancy OR mis-
carriage OR spontaneous abortion OR birth
weight OR gestation OR lactation OR birth
defects OR growth OR puberty OR fertility
OR neurotoxicity OR neurodevelopment OR
immunological). We identified 494 papers
and reviewed them for primary research.
On the basis of available data, we make rec-
ommendations regarding the introduction,
continuation, or reintroduction of DDT use
worldwide. These recommendations repre-
sent the consensus opinion of the authors and
participants present at the Eugene Kenaga
International DDT Conference.
Potential for Human Exposure
Environmental and biological monitoring
studies in the United States demonstrate
that use restrictions were successful in low-
ering human exposure to DDT. Estimated
dietary intake of DDT dropped > 200%
between 1970 and 1986 (ATSDR 2002),
whereas serum DDT concentrations declined
9-fold between 1980 and 2000 [Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
2003; Murphy et al. 1983]. Recent studies
in the United States report low concentra-
tions of DDT and DDE in food (U.S. Food
and Drug Administration 2002) and in house
dust and soil (Bradman et al. 1997; Butte
and Heinzow 2002). Yet nearly all U.S. resi-
dents have measurable serum p,p´‑DDE lev-
els, whereas p,p´‑DDT is detected in 5–10%
of the population (CDC 2005).
A sample of recent studies of DDT/DDE
serum levels in pregnant women and women
of reproductive age shows the different expo-
sure scenarios around the world. In this
sample of studies, low concentrations were
observed in U.S. women of reproductive age
participating in the 2001–2002 wave of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES; Table 1). The median
DDE serum concentration was 10-fold
higher in a population of primarily Mexican
immigrant women living in an agricultural
area of California where half of the women
had immigrated within the previous 5 years
(Bradman et al. 2007). DDE concentrations
in this Mexican-American cohort were similar
to those of a concurrent population living
in Morelos, Mexico, where DDT probably
had not been used for some time (Torres-
Sanchez et al. 2007). However, median DDE
serum concentrations in women residing in
Chiapas, Mexico, where DDT may have been
used up until 2000, were about five times
higher in 1998 (Koepke et al. 2004) than in
Morelos (Torres-Sanchez et al. 2007) and
within the range observed in older studies
from the United States when DDT was still
being used (Bhatia et al. 2005; Gladen et al.
2004; Longnecker et al. 2005). However, the
concentrations in pregnant women in Chiapas
are still orders of magnitude lower than those
reported in a study of South African men
whose houses were sprayed with DDT as part
of indoor residual spraying programs (mean
blood DDE concentration = 239 ± 215 µg/g
lipid) (Aneck-Hahn et al. 2007). Other stud-
ies conducted in South Africa also reported
very high levels of DDT/DDE in breast milk
(Bouwman et al. 1994, 2006). It may be
that the pattern of use and/or formulation of
DDT for malaria control differed in Chiapas
and South Africa. Nevertheless, these data
suggest that indoor residual spraying results
in high DDT exposure in humans, includ-
ing vulnerable populations, such as pregnant
women and fetuses.
Evidence for Carcinogenicity
and Cancer in Humans
In 1991, the International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC) rated DDT as “possibly
carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)” (IARC
1991). This rating was largely based on the
induction of liver tumors in experimental
animal studies that reported significant
increases in hepatomas (neoplastic liver cell
tumors) in multiple strains of male and female
rodents exposed to technical DDT orally (gav-
age or diet) or to p,p´‑DDE (diet) (IARC
1991). Most human studies reviewed by
IARC in 1991 did not show an association
between DDT exposure and cancer risk. Some
studies suggested that DDT exposure may be
associated with certain cancers (lung cancer
and lymphomas); however, the lack of control
for exposure to other chemicals, small study
size, insufficient data on confounding factors
(e.g., incomplete information on tobacco use),
and short follow-up time for long-latency can-
cers limited the ability to make any conclu-
sions at that time (IARC 1991). Research on
DDT/DDE exposure and cancer continued to
yield mixed results after the publication of the
IARC report. We review the recent research
with a focus on cancers of the liver, pancreas,
and breast.

Liver cancer. In an ecologic study, Cocco
et al. (2000) found that standardized mortality
rates (SMRs) for liver cancer were elevated in
whites but not in African Americans who lived
in states with high population-level adipose
tissue DDE concentrations. These researchers
offered no explanation for this racial differ-
ence. In a case–control study, McGlynn et al.
(2006) reported that the risk of liver cancer
was significantly elevated in Chinese men with
the highest blood levels of DDT [odds ratio
(OR) = 3.8; 95% confidence interval (CI),
1.7–8.0] compared with men with lower levels
of DDT. Blood levels of DDE were not asso-
ciated with a higher risk.
Pancreatic cancer. Mechanistic data sug-
gest that DDT could play a role in pancreatic
cancer by modulating activation of the onco-
gene K-ras (Porta et al. 1999). An association
of workplace exposure to DDT and the risk
of pancreatic cancer is supported by two stud-
ies. In a cohort of 5,886 DDT manufactur-
ing plant workers, Garabrant et al. (1992)
reported a 7.4-fold higher risk of pancreatic
cancer deaths in workers exposed to DDT for
an average of 47 months, as determined using
work records and interviews with coworkers,
compared with workers who had no exposure.
Similarly, deaths from pancreatic cancer were
significantly higher in a cohort occupationally
exposed to DDT compared with a control
cohort in an Australian study with follow-up
data from 1935 to the 1990s (SMR = 3.57;
95% CI, 1.09–15.40) (Beard et al. 2003). In
contrast, other studies have found no asso-
ciation between estimates of DDT exposure
among workers (Cocco et al. 2005) or serum/
adipose tissue levels of p,p´‑DDE and pancre-
atic cancer risk after adjustment for confound-
ers (Hardell et al. 2007; Hoppin et al. 2000).
It has been suggested that the etiology of pan-
creatic cancer may be causally linked to diabe-
tes mellitus and hyperinsulinemia (Michaud
2004) and thus linked to associations between
DDT and diabetes (see below).
Breast cancer. Although neither DDT nor
DDE induced mammary tumors in labora-
tory animal cancer bioassays (IARC 1991),
early studies suggested that DDE levels in
women were associated with a higher risk of
breast cancer (Snedeker 2001). Two recent
case–control studies (Charlier et al. 2004;
Rubin et al. 2006) also showed higher DDE
blood concentrations in cases than controls.
However, most case–control studies recently
published and reviewed have not supported
an association (Brody et al. 2004; Gatto et al.
2007; Ibarluzea et al. 2004; Iwasaki et al.
2008; Lopez-Cervantes et al. 2004; Siddiqui
et al. 2005; Snedeker 2001).
The literature on DDT and breast cancer
has two main limitations. First, most studies
used biological samples collected well after
exposure to technical DDT had occurred and
relied on serum concentrations of p,p´‑DDE as
a proxy for exposure to “DDT.” Second, most
studies included women who would not have
been exposed to technical DDT when young,
yet both animal (Birnbaum and Fenton 2003)
and human studies of radiation exposure
(Howe and McLaughlin 1996; Tokunaga
et al. 1994) strongly suggest that the breast is
most vulnerable to environmentally induced
carcinogenesis during several critical periods
such as in utero, before menarche, and before
first pregnancy.
Overcoming these past limitations, Cohn
et al. (2007) measured concentrations in
archived serum samples collected between
1959 and 1967 (peak years of DDT use) from
pregnant women participating in the Child
Health and Development Studies (CHDS).
Medical records were obtained nearly 40 years
later. Among women who were ≤ 14 years of
age by 1945 (when DDT was first introduced
for use by the general public), those with
blood concentrations in the highest tertile
were five times more likely to develop breast
cancer than those with blood levels in the
lowest tertile (OR = 5.4; 95% CI, 1.7–17.1).
However, there was no association between
serum p,p´-DDT levels and adult risk of
breast cancer among women who were not
exposed before 14 years of age, and interac-
tion by age in 1945 was statistically signifi-
cant. This study suggests that the prepubertal
and pubertal years are critical periods of expo-
sure. Thus, previous studies that measured
exposure in older women may have missed
the critical period.
Other cancers. Research has not sup-
ported an association of DDT or DDE and
incidence of colorectal, lung, bladder, pros-
tate, endometrial, and stomach cancers (Baris
et al. 1998; Cocco et al. 2005; Hardell et al.
2004; Howsam et al. 2004; Purdue et al. 2007;
Sturgeon et al. 1998; Weiderpass et al. 2000).
Although no associations were found with
serum DDT (Rothman et al. 1997), higher
DDE levels in dust, adipose tissue, and plasma
have been associated with non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma in case–control studies (Colt et al.
2005; Quintana et al. 2004; Spinelli et al.
2007). For other cancers, such as leukemia
(Flodin et al. 1988; Purdue et al. 2007), and
testicular cancer (Hardell et al. 2006; McGlynn
et al. 2008), evidence remains equivocal.
Evidence for Diabetes
Since Morgan et al.’s (1980) initial observa-
tion that the sum of DDT and DDE levels
in serum was 29% higher in occupationally
exposed workers with diabetes compared with
nondiabetics, a number of other studies have
been published on this subject. For example,
data from the 1999–2002 NHANES sug-
gested that elevated serum concentrations of
p,p´‑DDT (Everett et al. 2007) and p,p´‑DDE
(Lee et al. 2006) were significantly associ-
ated with the prevalence of diabetes. In addi-
tion, Lee et al. (2006) reported an increasing
trend in the odds of diabetes as exposure to
p,p´‑DDE increased (ptrend < 0.001) with
an OR of 4.3 (95% CI, 1.8–10.2) for those
≥ 90th percentile of exposure compared with
those in the lowest quartile.
Because diabetes occurs in Mexican
Americans twice as frequently as in non-
Hispanic whites (Haffner 1998), and serum
levels of p,p´‑DDE and p,p´‑DDT are higher
in Mexican Americans than other ethnic
groups in the U.S. population (CDC 2001),
data from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (HHANES) for 1982–
1984 were analyzed. Serum p,p´‑DDT or
p,p´‑DDE levels were dose related to the
preva­lence of self-reported diabetes in Mexican
Americans (Cox et al. 2007). Additionally, in a
study of Native Americans (Mohawks), Codru
et al. (2007) observed a significant positive
association between diabetes prevalence and
serum levels of p,p´‑DDE.
A Swedish study found that diabetes preva­
lence was significantly higher (ptrend = 0.04) in
Baltic Sea fishermen with elevated serum DDE
levels (Rylander et al. 2005), but not in their
wives. With a larger study population (non-
fisherman families), the same authors reported
a significant positive association (ptrend < 0.01)
between type 2 diabetes and serum p,p´-DDE
levels in Swedish women (Rignell-Hydbom
et al. 2007).
Collectively, these studies from the United
States and Sweden suggest that body burdens
of DDT and/or DDE may be associated with
the prevalence of diabetes. A variety of other
persistent environmental chemicals also have
been associated with diabetes prevalence (Lee
et al. 2006). However, given the high correla-
tion among various organochlorine exposures
(Bradman et al. 2007), additional research is
needed to delineate the specific contributions
of DDT and DDE.
Evidence for Health
Consequences to the Fetus
Pregnancy loss. In the U.S. Collaborative
Perinatal Project (CPP), where the median
maternal serum DDE level was 24.5 µg/L,
high DDE concentrations (45–59 vs.
< 15 µg/L) were associated with an increased
risk of fetal loss in previous pregnancies
(Longnecker et al. 2005). Although the out-
come occurred before DDE measurement,
this study of 1,717 women corroborated find-
ings from smaller studies (Korrick et al. 2001;
Saxena et al. 1981). Venners et al. (2005)
studied 338 nulliparous Chinese textile work-
ers with similar DDE concentrations (median,
29 ng/g serum) for the risk of early pregnancy
loss (measured by daily human chorionic
gonadotropin). Authors reported an OR of
Eskenazi et al.
1362	 volume 117 | number 9 | September 2009  •  Environmental Health Perspectives
1.17 (95% CI, 1.05–1.29) for each 10‑ng/g
serum increase in total DDT. In a case–
control study of habitual aborters, research-
ers did not observe higher mean serum DDE
levels in cases relative to controls (Sugiura-
Ogasawara et al. 2003).
Gestational length and birth weight.
Early studies on DDE and preterm delivery
(< 37 weeks of gestation) were small, and
results were inconsistent (Berkowitz et al.
1996; O’Leary et al. 1970; Saxena et al. 1981;
Wassermann et al. 1982). Studies using data
from larger cohorts also have not consistently
supported an association between exposure to
DDT/DDE and birth weight or gestational
duration. In a study of 2,380 pregnant women
participating in the CPP, Longnecker et al.
(2001) found that the odds of preterm delivery
were 3.1 times higher (95% CI, 1.8–5.4) in
women with serum DDE ≥ 60 µg/L compared
with those with DDE < 15 µg/L during preg-
nancy. Adjusted odds of having a child small
for gestational age also increased, but less con-
sistently (ptrend = 0.04). However, two analyses
of the CHDS, which was conducted around
the same time as the CPP, have found no asso-
ciations of DDT/DDE and preterm delivery
or small for gestational age, despite slightly
higher median DDE levels than in the CPP
(43 vs. 25 µg/L) (Farhang et al. 2005; Jusko
et al. 2006).
Most studies of more recent cohorts,
which had somewhat lower exposure than
those in the earlier studies, did not find an
association between maternal serum meas­ure­
ments of DDE and/or DDT and gestational
duration, premature labor, birth weight,
or other measures of fetal growth such as
crown–heel length or head circumference
(Bjerregaard and Hansen 2000; Fenster et al.
2006; Gladen et al. 2003; Karmaus and Zhu
2004; Khanjani and Sim 2006; Sagiv et al.
2007; Wood et al. 2007), although some
studies did find associations (Siddiqui et al.
2003; Weisskopf et al. 2005; Wolff et al.
2007). The high DDE serum concentrations
observed in the CPP and CHDS cohorts
during the 1960s are several-fold higher than
current serum levels, but substantially lower
than in populations where indoor residual
spraying is occurring.
Duration of lactation. Two studies
have found a shorter duration of lactation
among mothers with high breast milk DDE
concentrations (Gladen and Rogan 1995;
Rogan et al. 1987). A North Carolina study
of 858 women indicated that higher breast
milk DDE concentrations were associated
with a shorter median duration of lactation
(2.5 months for DDE > 6 µg/g lipids vs. 6.5
months for DDE < 1 µg/g lipids) (Rogan et al.
1987). A study of 229 Mexican women found
similar results (Gladen and Rogan 1995),
but only among women who had previously
lactated. Estrogenic effects of DDT were pos-
tulated to affect prolactin levels and milk pro-
duction (Gladen and Rogan 1995; Rogan
et al. 1987). A more recent study suggested
that DDE serum concentrations were related
to decreased rates of breast-feeding initiation
as well as shortened duration of lactation in
women who had never breast-fed and in non-
smoking women (Karmaus et al. 2005b), but
a Mexican study found that serum DDE was
associated with duration of lactation only in
women who previously breast-fed (Cupul-
Uicab et al. 2008). In this Mexican study of
784 mothers of male term babies, the hazard
ratio of weaning for women with high serum
DDE levels (cutoff point, 9 µg/g lipids) was
1.76 (95% CI, 1.22–2.53) in women who
had previously breast-fed and 0.91 (95% CI,
0.66–1.26) in women who had never breast-
fed. Previous lactation can reduce the mater-
nal body burden of DDE, and women who
breast-feed longer for previous infants tend to
do so for the current baby. Thus, associations
between DDE levels and early weaning may
be spurious, and further research is warranted.
Urogenital birth defects. Studies in rats
have suggested a relationship between fetal tis-
sue concentrations of 10–20 ppm of p,p´‑DDE
and reproductive abnormalities in male off-
spring (Gray et al. 2001). In the CPP birth
cohort, Longnecker et al. (2002) reported ORs
of 1.07 (95% CI, 0.97–1.18) for cryptorchid-
ism (n = 219), 1.01 (95% CI, 0.90–1.14) for
hypospadias (n = 199), and 1.06 (95% CI,
0.97–1.16) for polythelia (n = 167) for each
2.67 µg/g lipid increase in maternal serum
p,p´-DDE (Longnecker et al. 2002). However,
in the CHDS birth cohort, Bhatia et al. (2005)
found that the odds of cryptorchidism were
twice as high in participants with p,p´-DDT
levels above versus below the median (OR =
1.97; 95% CI, 1.40–2.54) but found no asso-
ciations between maternal serum p,p´‑DDE
and the odds of cryptorchidism, or between
p,p´‑DDT and p,p´‑DDE concentrations and
odds of hypospadias. A Spanish study also
reported more than a doubling of the odds of
cryptorchidism and/or hypospadias cases asso-
ciated with detectable levels of p,p´‑DDT (OR
= 2.63; 95% CI, 1.21–5.72) and o,p´‑DDT
(OR = 2.25; 95% CI, 1.03–4.89) measured in
placental tissues (Fernandez et al. 2007). Other
studies conducted in France (Brucker-Davis
et al. 2008) and in Finland and Denmark
(Damgaard et al. 2006) reported increased
colostrum levels of p,p´‑DDE, and elevated
breast milk concentrations of p,p´‑DDT,
o,p´‑DDT, p,p´‑DDE, and p,p´‑dichloro­
diphenyldichloroethane (DDD), respectively,
in cases of cryptorchidism compared with
­controls, although associations were not statis-
tically significant.
Child growth. Evidence for an association
between physical growth after birth and DDT
and DDE exposure is inconsistent. Maternal
DDT concentrations were not associated with
child weight or height at 5 years of age in
children participating in the CHDS (Jusko
et al. 2006). In contrast, those who had the
highest prenatal concentrations of DDE in
the CPP cohort (≥ 60 µg/L) compared with
the lowest (< 15 µg/L) were significantly
shorter at 1, 4, and 7 years of age (Ribas-Fito
et al. 2006a). However, a study that examined
growth in adolescent boys participating in
the CPP found no relation between mater-
nal serum levels of DDE or DDT in preg-
nancy and height, body mass index (BMI),
and other measures of growth (Gladen et al.
2004). Two other studies in older children
and in populations with much lower serum
levels reported conflicting findings: A study
from Germany found shorter height in
8-year-old girls in relation to higher DDE
concentration (Karmaus et al. 2002), and an
older North Carolina study found a relation
to taller height in boys 12–14 years of age
(Gladen et al. 2000). Overall, the evidence for
the relation of maternal DDT exposure and
child physical growth is weak.
Evidence for Reproductive
Effects
Age of onset of puberty. A small number of
human studies have examined DDT/DDE
and onset of menarche in girls, with two
studies finding associations of earlier age at
menarche with higher exposure (Ouyang
et al. 2005; Vasiliu et al. 2004) and one study
finding no association (Denham et al. 2005).
Ouyang et al. (2005) found that women with
higher serum levels of total DDT (i.e., the
sum of p,p´- and o,p´‑isomers of DDT, DDE,
and DDD) measured in adulthood (mean
age, 24.9 years) reported significantly earlier
age at onset of menarche, adjusting for BMI
and birth year. In contrast, Denham et al.
(2005) found no association between concur-
rent DDE blood concentrations [geometric
mean (GM) = 0.35 ppb] and menarcheal sta-
tus among 138 Mohawk girls 10–16.9 years
of age. Vasiliu et al. (2004) estimated serum
DDE levels during pregnancy in 151 women
by back-calculating from measurements made
up to 25 years later. They reported that higher
(estimated) prenatal DDE levels were associ-
ated with earlier age at menarche in daughters
(adjusted β = –0.07, p = 0.04).
Two studies examined onset of puberty
rather than menarche in relation to DDE
exposure. Gladen et al. (2000) found no asso-
ciation between transplacental or lactational
DDE concentrations and pubertal stage as
self-reported in a cohort of approximately 315
adolescent girls with relatively high exposure
(range, 0.3–25.8 ppm). Wolff et al. (2008)
performed Tanner exams on approximately
80 9-year-old girls and found no difference in
The Pine River statement

concurrent DDE plasma levels in those girls
who had reached Tanner breast stage 2 (onset
of puberty) and those who did not, but DDE
levels were low. Only one study has exam-
ined onset of puberty in boys. Gladen et al.
(2000) found no association between DDE
and self-reported Tanner staging in boys up
to 16 years of age. All these studies examined
associations with DDE and not DDT.
Although these studies of puberty and
menarche suggest an association with expo-
sure, no study has examined the relationship
of serum levels of DDE and DDT concen-
trations in blood collected before puberty in
relation to Tanner staging in girls or boys.
Male fertility. Researchers have investi-
gated the seminal parameters of men living in
regions of high DDT use. In one such study
(de Jager et al. 2006), participants were drawn
from rural communities in the malaria-en-
demic region of Chiapas, Mexico, with a his-
tory of high use and where DDT was sprayed
inside their homes at least annually from the
late 1940s until 1997 (Stapleton 1998); sam-
pling took place between 2000 and 2001.
The mean serum DDE concentration (45 ±
31 µg/g lipids) was 100 times higher than
reported in unexposed populations. The per-
centage of motile sperm was negatively cor-
related with plasma DDE concentrations,
whereas the percentage of sperm with mor-
phologic tail defects and insufficient sperm
chromatin condensation was positively corre-
lated with these levels (de Jager et al. 2006).
In a study conducted in Limpopo, South
Africa, men were selected from rural com-
munities in a malaria-endemic area where
DDT is sprayed annually inside unpainted
houses, but not inside painted houses (Aneck-
Hahn et al. 2007). The GM serum concentra-
tions of DDT (90.2 ± 102.4 µg/g) and DDE
(215.5 ± 210.6 µg/g) in the 311 participants
from this area were extremely high. DDT
and DDE serum concentrations were also
significantly higher (p < 0.001) in partici-
pants whose houses were sprayed with DDT
(101.9 µg/g lipid DDT and 239.0 µg/g lipid
DDE) compared with those whose houses
were not sprayed (30.5 µg/g lipid DDT and
99.5 µg/g lipid DDE). Their semen volume
was low (1.9 ± 1.3 mL) and several sperm
motion parameters were impaired, includ-
ing the percentage of motile sperm in men
with higher DDT (r = –0.27, p < 0.001) and
DDE concentrations (r = –0.20, p < 0.001).
In another cross-sectional study of 48 DDT
applicators (Dalvie et al. 2004) conducted in
Limpopo, overall semen quality was low, and
DDT, but not DDE, serum levels were asso-
ciated with decreased sperm count.
Studies of semen quality or genetic mark-
ers in sperm have been conducted in other
populations, usually with lower exposure
than noted in Chiapas or South Africa. For
example, case–control studies of men of sub-
fertile couples have found no difference in
the men’s DDE serum levels (Charlier and
Foidart 2005) but higher current blood levels
in the mothers of the cases compared with
controls, and no association with DNA integ-
rity (neutral comet assay) (Hauser et al. 2003).
Similarly, the multinational (Greenland;
Warsaw, Poland; Kharkiv, Ukraine; and
Sweden) INUENDO study of European and
Inuit pregnant women and their spouses failed
to find associations of DDE serum levels and
conventional measures of semen quality (Toft
et al. 2006), chromatin integrity (Spano et al.
2005), and hormone levels or a measure of
apoptosis (Stronati et al. 2006). However,
as in many populations where exposure to
several organochlorines, including polychlo-
rinated biphenyls, may be highly correlated,
independent associations with DDE often
could not be established.
Overall, studies of highly exposed pop-
ulations suggest that male fertility may be
adversely affected by DDT exposure, but
studies in populations with moderate to low
exposure levels do not support a relationship
between exposure and male fertility outcomes.
Female reproduction, fertility, and time to
conception. Two recent studies examined the
relationship of DDT/DDE levels and men-
strual cycle characteristics and found only
weak associations (Chen et al. 2005; Cooper
et al. 2005). However, one study from the
INUENDO population reported a 3‑fold
increase in risk of long menstrual cycles
among Polish women but not among women
from other European countries (Toft et al.
2008). Another study using data from the
Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey found that both DDT and DDE lev-
els were associated with a significantly earlier
age of menopause (Akkina et al. 2004).
Two cross-sectional studies found sug-
gestive evidence that p,p´‑DDE serum lev-
els in pregnant women were correlated with
delays in conception (Axmon et al. 2006; Law
et al. 2005), but another study in Mexican-
American women did not find a relation with
either p,p´‑DDT or p,p´‑DDE serum levels
(Harley et al. 2008). One of these studies
(Axmon et al. 2006) also examined paternal
serum p,p´‑DDE and found no effects on
partners’ time to pregnancy. In contrast, a
study of 105 male DDT applicators found
that p,p´‑DDE exposure, estimated by occu-
pation history, was associated with delayed
time to pregnancy in their spouses, defined
using marriage dates and birth dates of first-
born children (Cocco et al. 2005).
The only study to examine in utero expo-
sure to DDT and time to pregnancy was con-
ducted among 289 women born in California
between 1960 and 1963 (CHDS). Authors
found that each 10‑µg/L increase in mothers’
serum concentrations of p,p´‑DDT and
p,p´‑DDE during pregnancy was associated
with a 32% reduction and a 16% increase,
respectively, in their daughters’ per cycle
probability of pregnancy (Cohn et al. 2003).
The ratio of these two compounds varied
considerably, and longer time to pregnancy
in daughters was observed as the ratio of
p,p´‑DDT to p,p´‑DDE increased in maternal
serum samples. Findings suggest that recent
exposure or direct exposure to the pesticide,
rather than chronic exposure to p,p´‑DDE in
the food chain, was the underlying risk factor.
Overall, the few studies conducted to date
suggest that DDT exposure may affect time
to pregnancy, but more research is needed.
Evidence for
Neurodevelopmental Effects
DDT exerts its insecticidal effects by dis-
rupting the nervous system. Animal studies
confirm that DDT is a neurodevelopmental
toxicant (ATSDR 2002). In mice, exposure
to DDT timed to sensitive periods of pre­
natal (Craig and Ogilvie 1974) and neonatal
(Eriksson and Nordberg 1986; Eriksson et al.
1990; Johansson et al. 1996) nervous sys-
tem development has been shown to cause
behavioral and neurochemical changes into
adulthood.
The few studies conducted in humans have
focused primarily on exposure to DDE rather
than DDT. In a North Carolina birth cohort
recruited in the 1980s, Rogan et al. (1986)
reported that maternal serum and breast milk
DDE levels were related to hyporeflexia in a
dose-dependent fashion in infants assessed by
the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment
Scale (BNBAS), but this finding has not been
replicated in more recent studies (Engel et al.
2007; Fenster et al. 2006; Stewart et al. 2000).
In a recent investigation from Massachusetts,
DDE measured in cord blood was negatively
related to BNBAS measures of alertness and
attention and positively related to measures of
irritability, although only the trend for irrita-
bility was significant (Sagiv et al. 2008).
The North Carolina study reported no
adverse association between perinatal DDE
exposure and performance on the Bayley
Scales of Infant Development (BSID) from
6 to 24 months of age (Gladen et al. 1988;
Rogan and Gladen 1991); on the McCarthy
Scales of Children’s Abilities (MCSA) at ages
3, 4, and 5 years; or on school performance
at 8–10.5 years (Gladen and Rogan 1991).
Similarly, a study conducted in Oswego,
New York, found no association of DDE lev-
els and performance on the Fagan Test of
Infant Intelligence at 6 and 12 months of
age (Darvill et al. 2000). However, a smaller
Spanish study (Ribas-Fito et al. 2003) of
92 infants 13 months of age found a signifi-
cant negative association between relatively
Eskenazi et al.
1364	 volume 117 | number 9 | September 2009  •  Environmental Health Perspectives
low cord serum DDE levels and cogni-
tive, psychomotor, and social development
on the BSID and Griffith Scales of Infant
Development. Similarly, a study of 230
infants from Mexico found that maternal
serum DDE levels were inversely associated
with psychomotor development scores on the
BSID at 3, 6, and 12 months (Torres-Sanchez
et al. 2007). Using the Center for the Health
Assessment of Mothers and Children of
Salinas (CHAMACOS) cohort of Mexican-
American children, Eskenazi et al. (2006) also
reported an inverse association of maternal
serum DDE and psychomotor development
at 6 and 12 but not at 24 months, and with
mental development at 24 months.
In a small study measuring visual evoked
potentials (VEPs) in 12-month-olds (Riva
et al. 2004), wave latency VEPs at 15 min
were significantly related to the colostral levels
of both DDT and DDE, and wave latency
VEPs at 60 min were related to levels of DDT.
However, findings were no longer statistically
significant after authors controlled for the
plasma levels of long-chain poly­unsaturated
fatty acids, thought to be one of the beneficial
components of breast milk for brain devel-
opment. The authors concluded that breast-
feeding in itself may exert a protective effect
against contaminants in human milk.
Only two studies have examined the rela-
tionship of DDT levels and cognitive func-
tioning. Increased maternal serum DDT
levels were associated with poorer psychomo-
tor development at 6, 12, and 24 months and
mental development at 12 and 24 months
in the CHAMACOS cohort (Eskenazi et al.
2006). Breast-feeding did not have a negative
relationship with mental development in the
group with the highest maternal DDT levels.
In another study, cord serum DDT levels
were also found to be associated with poorer
performance in general cognitive, memory,
quantitative, verbal, and executive function
domains of the MCSA in 4- and 5-year-old
children in Spain (Ribas-Fito et al. 2006b).
These studies suggest that DDT, and
less so DDE, may be associated with neuro­
develop­mental deficits. In addition, breast-
feeding may modulate some of the negative
effects of DDT, but this needs to be examined
when exposure is high such as in communities
where indoor residual spraying is occurring.
Follow-up studies of these populations are
needed to verify whether these developmental
deficits persist.
Evidence for Other Health Effects
Although thyroid hormones are essential for
normal brain development (Dunn 1993),
studies suggest that DDE, and possibly DDT,
may depress triiodothyronine (T3) and/or thy-
roxine (T4) in maternal, cord, and preschool
children’s blood (Abdelouahab et al. 2008;
Alvarez-Pedrerol et al. 2008; Asawasinsopon
et al. 2006; Maervoet et al. 2007; Takser et al.
2005) but not entirely consistently (Chevrier
et al. 2008). Higher DDT levels were also
found in cases of congenital hypothyroidism
relative to controls (Nagayama et al. 2007a).
Results from studies conducted in men and
nonpregnant women have generally been
inconsistent. Two of these studies reported
a positive association between serum DDE
and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
concentrations (Meeker et al. 2007; Rylander
et al. 2006), one found a positive correla-
tion between DDE and total T3 (Langer
et al. 2007a), whereas other studies found no
associations between DDE and TSH (Langer
et al. 2005, 2006, 2007a, 2007b; Turyk et al.
2006), total T3 or the free T4 index (Turyk
et al. 2006).
DDT and particularly DDE have dem-
onstrated the potential for modulating the
human immune response as measured by mul-
tiple markers such as interleukin-4 (Daniel
et al. 2002) and interleukin-13 (Brooks et al.
2007), plasma levels of type 1 (interferon-γ)
response to mitogen in nursing mothers, white
blood cell counts, and various lymphocyte
phenotypes (Nagayama et al. 2007b; Noakes
et al. 2006; Vine et al. 2001), and immuno-
globulin (Ig) A, G, and E levels (Cooper et al.
2004; Karmaus et al. 2005a). Associations
with immune system–related conditions such
as aplastic anemia (with DDT but not DDE)
(Ahamed et al. 2006; Issaragrisil et al. 2006),
asthma (with DDE) (Karmaus et al. 2001;
Sunyer et al. 2005), otitis media (with DDE)
(Dallaire et al. 2004), and farmer’s lung (with
technical DDT use) (Hoppin et al. 2007) were
also reported. In children, one cross-­sectional
study of German schoolchildren found
that DDE levels in blood were associated
with increased IgE blood levels and asthma
(Karmaus et al. 2001). A longitudinal study of
405 Spanish children confirmed the associa-
tion between DDE exposure and asthma, but
found that DDE was not associated with IgE
levels (Sunyer et al. 2005). Additional research
is needed to understand the effects of DDT/
DDE on the immune system and associated
diseases, especially because DDT is used in
areas where there are often high rates of HIV.
Conclusions
The use of DDT historically may have helped
prevent millions of infections and deaths from
insect-borne diseases. Based on recent stud-
ies, we conclude that humans are exposed to
DDT and DDE, that indoor residual spray-
ing can result in substantial exposure, and
that DDT may pose a risk for human popula-
tions. However, few studies have measured
body burdens of both DDE and DDT, and
studies have rarely investigated the effects of
DDT/DDE exposure at levels observed in
populations exposed through indoor residual
spraying. Furthermore, information on expo-
sure to DDT/DDE during critical periods is
limited for outcomes such as cancer.
We are concerned about the health of
children and adults given the persistence of
DDT and its active metabolites in the envi-
ronment and in the body, and we are par-
ticularly concerned about the potential effects
of continued DDT use on future genera-
tions. We recognize the serious implications
of restricting DDT use given that an esti-
mated 880,000 people die each year from
malaria, most of whom are < 5 years of age
(WHO 2008). Given our continually deepen-
ing understanding of the effects of DDT use
on humans, we ask global policy makers to
consider the following issues:
•	In the United States, individuals have been
exposed to DDT by working in occupa-
tional settings and by living in proximity
to DDT manufacturing facilities. State and
federal agencies should monitor levels of
contaminants in residents near Superfund
sites (e.g., Pine River/Velsicol Chemical
Corp. Michigan Superfund site) and con-
duct health effects studies if biomonitoring
indicates persistently elevated levels of DDT
or DDE.
•	Few studies of health outcomes have been
conducted in populations where indoor
residual spraying with DDT is occurring.
These populations likely have much higher
exposures to DDT and may differ from those
previously studied in ways that might affect
susceptibility (e.g., genetics, diet, health sta-
tus, and social class). Research is needed to
determine the exposure and health risks asso-
ciated with DDT used for indoor residual
spraying in the relevant communities.
•	Children, pregnant women, and those who
are immunocompromised may be most at
risk for the effects of DDT. People in many
malaria-endemic areas where DDT is being
used also have high rates of HIV/AIDS
infection.
•	Breast-feeding is the best form of nutrition
for infants and is recommended up to at
least 1 year of age by the American Academy
of Pediatrics (2005). In some African coun-
tries, women may breast-feed for up to
2 years. However, because of the lipophilic
nature of DDT/DDE, breast milk is a major
route of DDT/DDE exposure to infants.
Significant public health consequences could
ensue should breast-feeding be discouraged
as a result of high DDT contamination.
•	DDT may be a valuable short-term approach
for controlling malaria, but measures should
be taken to reduce human exposure to this
pesticide. DDT exposure could conceiv-
ably be reduced through strict adherence to
indoor residual spraying guidelines, better
education of communities and applicators
The Pine River statement
Environmental Health Perspectives  •  volume 117 | number 9 | September 2009	 1365
regarding the potential hazards of DDT
exposure, improved application methods and
formulations, and a better understanding of
the determinants of exposure.
•	New methods of vector control should be
developed and rigorously tested considering
local differences such as in vectors, parasites,
ecology, and culture. As is the case for DDT,
new methods for vector control should be
evaluated not only for their effectiveness, but
also for their potential adverse effects on the
environment and populations, including to
susceptible subpopulations such as those who
are immunocompromised and malnourished.
For example, pyrethroids have been substi-
tuted for DDT in indoor residual spraying in
some locations, yet there is little information
on their effects to human health.
Current evidence on DDT exposure to
human populations and on its potential health
effects support the Stockholm Convention on
Persistent Organic Pollutants, which empha-
sizes that DDT should be used with cau-
tion, only when needed, and when no other
effective, safe, and affordable alternatives are
locally available. Under the convention, each
country currently using DDT is required to
provide an implementation and management
plan to limit the use of DDT to disease vec-
tor control and to reduce reliance on DDT.
Countries should be assisted so that they can
ultimately rely on other sustainable methods,
techniques, and strategies for malaria control.
Given the paucity of data in populations who
are currently potentially exposed to high lev-
els of DDT, we urge the global community
to monitor exposure to DDT and to evaluate
its potential health impacts both in malaria-
endemic regions of the world and in locations
where DDT use has been historically high,
such as the Pine River Superfund site.
