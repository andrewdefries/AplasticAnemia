Self-renewing Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) are responsible for reconstitution of all blood cell lineages. Sca-1 is the “stem cell
antigen” marker used to identify the primitive murine HSC population, the expression of which decreases upon diﬀerentiation to
other mature cell types. Sca-1+ HSCs maintain the bone marrow stem cell pool throughout the life. Aplastic anemia is a disease
considered to involve primary stem cell deﬁciency and is characterized by severe pancytopenia and a decline in healthy blood cell
generation system. Studies conducted in our laboratory revealed that the primitive Sca-1+ BM-HSCs (bone marrow hematopoietic
stem cell) are signiﬁcantly aﬀected in experimental Aplastic animals pretreated with chemotherapeutic drugs (Busulfan and
Cyclophosphamide) and there is increased Caspase-3 activity with consecutive high Annexin-V positivity leading to premature
apoptosis in the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell population in Aplastic condition. The Sca-1bright, that is, “more primitive”
BM-HSC population was more aﬀected than the “less primitive” BM-HSC Sca-1dim population. The decreased cell population and
the receptor expression were directly associated with an empty and deranged marrow microenvironment, which is evident from
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The above experimental evidences hint toward the manipulation of receptor expression for
the beneﬁt of cytotherapy by primitive stem cell population in Aplastic anemia cases.
1. Introduction
Multipotent self-renewing HSCs are responsible for replen-
ishing all blood cell lineages throughout the life [1, 2].
Although representing only 1 in 10 000 bone marrow cells,
sophisticated methods have been developed to isolate HSCs
to high purity allowing meaningful studies of candidate
stem cells in vitro. Clonogenic multipotent mouse HSCs are
contained within the Sca-1+ population of hematopoietic
cells [3, 4] and Sca-1 is the most common marker often
used to identify adult murine HSCs [5, 6] and can be
used to isolate a nearly pure primitive HSC population
[7, 8]. Sca-1 expression is regulated in a complex fashion in
the hematopoietic microenvironment. As HSCs diﬀerentiate
into common myeloid or lymphoid progenitors, the Sca-1
expression is downregulated [9–11]. Maintenance of these
primitive Sca-1+ HSCs is thought to depend on specialized
microenvironmental nest within the bone marrow, which
has been historically called the hematopoietic inductive
microenvironment [12] or “Stem Cell niche” [13]. The
stem cell niche in one way maintains the hematopoiesis by
secreting a large number of hematopoietic growth factors
supporting proliferation, diﬀerentiation and survival of
HSCs [14, 15], and in other way it maintains the quiescent
stem cell pool by tightly regulating the homeostatic balance
between self-renewal and diﬀerentiation [16, 17].
In several hematological malignancies, this hematopoi-
etic inductive microenvironment loses its controlling poten-
tial to maintain the homeostatic balance between self-
renewal and diﬀerentiation of HSCs leading to either hypo-
plastic or hyperplastic marrow failure. Chronic hypoplastic
bone marrow failure or Aplastic anemia is one of such disease
2 Stem Cells International
characterized by an empty bone marrow, neutropenia , and
a drastic decline in marrow’s ability to produce healthy
mature blood cells [18, 19]. The disease was ﬁrst described
by Ehrlich at the end of nineteenth century [20] and has
been considered to involve primitive stem cell deﬁciency
or more currently considered disorganized stem cell niche
[21–24]. In most cases of Aplastic anemia, bone marrow
failure is believed to result from immunologically mediated
destruction of primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells [25, 26]. There is also indirect evidence suggesting high
rate of premature apoptosis in bone marrow hematopoietic
compartment leading to a degenerative marrow in aplasia
[27–30]. Although much reports are present regarding the
stem cell dysregulation in Aplastic anemia, the particular
evidence of the involvement of primitive HSC and HSC niche
is still obscure.
The present study aims toward evaluating the fate/
apoptosis of primitive Sca-1+ HSC population and bone
marrow microenvironmental structure through cell surface
phenotypic study by ﬂowcytometric (FCM) analysis/caspase-
3 assay, light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopic
(SEM) evaluation, respectively, in experimentally induced
Aplastic anemic mice following pretreatment with cytotoxic
drugs like busulfan and cyclophosphamide [31, 32].
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animal. Inbred Swiss albino mice, thirty in number (15
animals each for normal control and experimental group)
were housed in ﬁlter top cages and watered ad libitum.
Twenty weeks old mice weighed to approximately 18–20 gm,
received 20 mg/kg busulfan and 80 mg/kg cyclophosphamide
intraperitoneally on day 0th and 28th. Controls received
comparable volumes of saline [32].
2.2. Peripheral Blood. Twelve weeks after the second injection
of Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide, approximately 300 μL
of blood was collected by tail vein puncture from each
animal using heparinised vials. Neutrophil count, total and
diﬀerential WBC count, reticulocyte, platelet count, and
hemoglobin percentage were taken for the detection of whole
hemogram proﬁle.
2.3. Isolation of BM-HSC. Eighty-four days after the second
injection for development of Aplastic anemia, animals were
sacriﬁced to isolate the long bones (femur, tibia, ﬁbula).
Bone marrow was taken out from the above mentioned
bones by ﬂushing with RPMI 1640 media by syringe and
the cells were mixed well with repeated pipetting. Stem cells
were separated from the whole bone marrow population
through percoll density gradient at the interface of 1.050
density [33, 34]. Cells thus prepared were washed in PBS
and ﬁnally transferred to non-FBS RPMI 1640 media and
the cell distribution was noted by counting the cells for the
experimental group of animal.
2.4. Flow Cytometry (FCM) Analysis. (a) For the analysis of
membrane bound Sca-1, BM-HSCs (1×106
) were incubated
for 30 minutes at 37◦
C in dark with 2 μL of phycoerythrin
(PE) labeled anti-mouse Sca-1 mAb (BD-Bioscience, USA)
and then washed twice in phosphate-buﬀered saline to wash
oﬀ the excess ﬂuorescence. Samples were analyzed by BD-
FACS Callibur (Becton Dickenson, USA) using CellQuestpro
software.
(b) For the analysis of apoptosis, BM-HSCs (1 × 106
)
were incubated for 30 minutes at 37◦
C in dark with
2 μL of PE- labeled anti-mouse Sca-1 mAb (BD-Bioscience,
USA) and 5 μL (diluted with binding buﬀer) of Fluorescein
isothiocyanate- (FITC-) labeled anti-mouse Annexin V mAB
(e-bioscience, Sandiego, USA). Excess ﬂuorescence was then
washed oﬀ with PBS. Samples were analyzed by BD-
FACS Callibur (Becton Dickenson, USA) using CellQuestpro
software.
2.5. Assay for Caspase-3 Activity. Intracellular caspase-3
activity of the BM-HSC were assessed by caspase-3 colori-
metric assay kit (Clonetech, USA). Approximately 2 × 106
BM-HSCs were lysed by incubating for 10 minutes with
50 μL of chilled cell lysis buﬀer on ice. The cell lysate was
centrifuged, the pellet discarded, and the supernatant mixed
with 50 μL of 2x reaction buﬀer/DTT mix, 5 μL of 1 mM
Caspase-3 substrate (DEVD-pNA; 50 μM ﬁnal concentra-
tion) and incubated at 37◦
C for 1 hour in water bath. The
negative control reaction did not contain the conjugated
substrate. Finally, the samples were read at 405 nm in a
microplate reader.
2.6. Bone Marrow Smear Study. Bone marrows of the normal
and experimental Aplastic groups of animals were stained by
Leishman staining to observe the particular morphological
changes of the bone marrow architecture in the disease
concerned under light microscopy (400x magniﬁcation).
2.7. Sample Preparation and Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM). A small portion of the intact marrow tissue con-
taining the total niche was macerated slowly in physiological
manner without damaging the inner cell mass and kept in
2.8% glutaraldehyde overnight for ﬁxation. To dry the tissue,
it was repeatedly passed through 30%, 50%, 70%, 100%
gradients of alcohol and ﬁnally critical point drying was
done. Then after coating with gold (Au) in IB-2 ion, the
coater samples went through Scanning Electron Microscopic
examination using S-5330 Hitachi SEM and the results were
recorded.
2.8. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analysis of results was
performed using Students’ t-test of the standard deviation
from the mean of diﬀerent data. All results were evaluated
statistically by applying the SPSS-PC package (Version 9.0,
SPSS, Chicago, USA). A probability of P < .01 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results

WBC, polymorpho nuclear neutrophils and platelets were
determined following standard laboratory techniques. The
results (Table 1) showed a depressed hemoglobin level with
uniformly reduced corpuscular counts, of which reticulocyte
counts are signiﬁcantly low (≤0.2) in Aplastic groups
(0.18%) compared with the normal range (0.73%–1%).
The total WBC and neutrophil counts were found to be
signiﬁcantly low in the diseased group (WBC 2.7 × 103

Neutrophil 7.35%, respectively) compared to the normal
counterparts (WBC 6.2 × 103

3.2. Flowcytometric Analysis. (a)Phenotypic characterization
of Sca1 receptor expression by BM-HSCs indicated a highly
downregulated Sca1+ population in Aplastic anemia induced

aﬀected in Aplastic anemia (Figure 1(c)) with only 0.01%
of the gated cells present in R2 region compared to 12.23%
present in the normal (Figure 1(b)). Further, the R1 region

HSCs indicates higher rate of premature senescence in the
primitive bone marrow population in Aplastic anemia.
3.3. Caspase-3 Activity. Caspase-3 activity showed by BM-
HSCs in Aplastic anemia (49%) was signiﬁcantly higher
compared to that of the normal control (2.6%) (Figure 3),

resulting in marked decrease in the primitive Sca1+ popula-
tion which have already been conﬁrmed by Flowcytometric
analysis.
3.4. Bone Marrow Architecture Study. The typical bone
marrow architecture was observed in normal as well as
in experimental groups by bone marrow smear study. In
Aplastic anemia (Figure 4(b)), the marrow is ﬁlled with
large fat cells (adipocytes) leaving scattered empty spaces in
comparison with the normal (Figure 4(a)), which showed
densely packed distribution of cells.
3.5. Scanning Electron Microscopy for Bone Marrow Microen-
vironmental Structure. Scanning Electron Microscopy of
normal and Aplastic anemic bone marrow exhibited an

tic anemia (Figure 5(b)) with deranged microenvironmental
status and other cellular components compared to the
normal marrow (Figure 5(a)).

4. Discussion
Bone marrow failure by benzene and related aryl hydro-
carbons and alkylating agents generate catabolites that are
directly toxic to stem cells and causes a drastic decline in
the marrow’s functional ability to produce mature blood
cells [35, 36]. In our experimental setup, we used busulfan
and cyclophosphamide in combination to induce bone
marrow damage rather failure which is reﬂected in the
peripheral blood hemogram. The peripheral blood pancy-
topenia includes neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, declined
hemoglobin level, along with lesser number of reticulo-
cytes signiﬁes the busulfan and cyclophosphamide induced
chronic hypoplastic marrow failure. At around 9 weeks
after the injection of chemotherapeutic drugs, the peripheral
blood started showing the hypoplastic marrow failure reﬂec-
tions, which was signiﬁcantly evident at about 12 weeks (time
of our experiment).
The scanty peripheral blood proﬁle is the evidence of
bone marrow failure characterized by damaged stem cell
population that has been termed as “residual injury” [37,
38]. The characteristics of “residual injury” are that it is
permanent, there is impairment of stem cell proliferation
leading to moderate marrow failure and complete failure of

stem cell proliferation may ensue leading to severe marrow
failure and death [39, 40].
To denote the “residual injury” of BM-HSCs, we investi-
gated the Sca-1 receptor expression pattern. The bright and
dim Sca-1+ primitive BM-HSCs depicted a typical pattern
of receptor expression in Aplastic anemic condition. The
Sca-1bright population is more aﬀected (0.01%) in Aplastic
animals in comparison with the normal group (12.23%)
rather than Sca-1dim population, which showed 2.30%
positivity in aplasia compared to 8.83% in normal.
The most straight-forward explanation for these diﬀer-
ential receptor expressions is based on the bone marrow
primitive cell population damage induced by busulfan and
cyclophosphamide. The Sca-1bright stem cell population is
the “more primitive” and the Sca-1dim denotes the “less
primitive” population. We hypothesize that, due to the
diﬀerence in their maturity level the Sca-1bright, that is, “more
primitive” population is getting more aﬀected regarding their
receptor expression than the Sca-1dim, that is, “less primitive”
cell population which can resist themselves a little more due
to their maturity level though both of these populations
are in quiescent state, from the chemotherapeutic damage.
So, the Sca-1dim and Sca-1bright receptor expression as well
as their maturity level has signiﬁcant correlation with the
combined chemotherapeutic drug induced bone marrow
cellular damage.
6 Stem Cells International
The reduction of Sca-1 population in Aplastic anemia
shows damage of primitive stem cells and their premature
senescence which is further demonstrated by ﬂowcytometric
analysis using an apoptotic marker Annexin-V. Regarding
the Sca-1+ Annexin-V+
population, that is, the dual positive
cells, the pattern of apoptosis in the Sca-1+ BM-HSC is
found to be signiﬁcantly higher in Aplastic group (3.05%)
in comparison with the normal (0.46%). So we can say that
the Aplastic BM-HSC bares a much higher shift to the dual
positive zone, signifying a higher apoptotic pattern of Sca-1+
cells.
From the functional viewpoint, we examined the
caspase-3 level in Aplastic anemic condition in comparison
with the normal. The results showed inspiring interrela-
tionship regarding the higher cellular (BM-HSCs) apoptosis
in Aplastic anemic condition at the backdrop of elevated
caspase-3 level which is much lower in case of normal. So
after induction of aplasia by combined chemotherapeutics
BM-HSCs delineated reduction of Sca-1bright/dim population
as well as highly elevated caspase-3 level.
Bone marrow smear study revealed a typical Aplastic
anemic bone marrow feature with frequent presence of large
fat cells (adipocytes) with empty spaces compared to the
normal healthy marrow.
The scanning electron microscopic picture showed lack
of cell in the bone marrow of Aplastic animals that bears
hollow cavity like appearance as well, which is not found in
the normal bone marrow. The hollow cavities reﬂected the
premature senescence pattern by combined chemotherapeu-
tic induction and associated higher level of caspase-3 activity.
So we can conclude that busulfan and cyclophosphamide
induce massive destruction of BM HSCs leading to marrow
hypoplasia, peripheral pancytopenia, and bone marrow
microenvironmental damage [41–43] by forming deranged
marrow structure with “pin-hole” views.
Finally, the gross “residual damage” evidenced by SEM
and increased caspase-3 level also severely aﬀected the
Sca-1bright, that is, “more primitive” BM-HSC population
more than the “less primitive” BM-HSC Sca-1dim depending
on their maturity status.
