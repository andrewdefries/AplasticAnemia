Abstract: Eltrombopag is one of a number of novel agents recently developed for use in the
treatment of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Rather than preventing destruction
of platelets, these agents increase the production of platelets, presumably overwhelming the
immune system resulting in normal platelet counts in individuals refractory to or dependent on
other therapies.These treatments are well tolerated and in randomized controlled trials show an
improvement in platelet counts and a reduction in bleeding in refractory patients. This article
summarizes the development of this new class of drug and evaluates the safety and efficacy of
eltrombopag in patients with ITP.
Keywords: eltrombopag, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, thrombopoietin
Introduction
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an acquired disease of low platelet counts (less
than 100 × 109
/L) with no clear initiating or underlying cause. ITP may manifest with
bleeding symptoms which correlate, to some extent, with the severity of thrombocy-
topenia. The majority of cases are considered primary, where a precipitating cause is
unknown, whereas others are attributed as secondary to coexisting medical conditions
such as systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and immune
deficiency disorders.Although the definition of chronic ITP has been debated, a recent
consensus statement suggests this should be considered if platelets remain below
normal for more than 12 months.1
The pathogenesis of ITP is complex but involves premature destruction of platelets
mediated by anti-platelet antibodies2
and/or by directT cell mediated platelet lysis.3
In
addition to increased platelet destruction, there is also evidence of decreased platelet
production. In 1989, Gernsheimer et al4
described inappropriately normal or decreased
platelet production in some patients with ITP. Further studies have shown increased
apoptosis in megakaryocytes in patients with ITP5
and CD34+ cells grown with plasma
from patients with ITP have impaired development of megakaryocytes and production
of platelets suggesting that the anti-platelet antibody not only results in premature
destruction of platelets but also impairs platelet production.2
Treatment aims in ITP have previously concentrated on preventing platelet destruc-
tion using steroids, immunoglobulins, immunosuppressive agents and splenectomy.6,7
However, many of these treatments are unsatisfactory with the morbidity and mortality
of this disorder relating as much from the side effects of treatment such as infections as

from bleeding.6
Novel treatment strategies that do not include
immunosuppression are needed. Following the understand-
ing of the role of megakaryocytes in the pathogenesis of ITP,
and the appreciation of the low level of platelet production
in patients with ITP, the potential use of agents with throm-
bopoietic ability in ITP has been explored.
This review will focus on the development and therapeutic
use of one of these agents eltrombopag, in chronic ITP.
Thrombopoiesis
Over the last 25 years a number of hemopoietic growth
factors with thrombopoietic activity have been identi-
fied including granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulat-
ing factor (GM-CSF); stem cell factor (c-kit ligand);
interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-3, IL-6 and IL-11; and thrombo-
poietin (TPO).8–11,12
Gene-targeting studies have demon-
strated that TPO, the c-MPL ligand, is the most important
physiologic regulator of steady-state megakaryocyte and
platelet production.13,14
TPO and its biology
TPO is a large molecule (95 KDa) synthesized primarily in
the liver as a single 333-amino acid precursor protein. The
receptor binding domain ofTPO contains 153 amino-terminal
residues: Each TPO molecule binds two TPO receptors, one
via a high-affinity binding site (13 amino acids) and the other
via a low affinity binding site (11 amino acids).15
Binding of
TPO to its receptor triggers the activation of the cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinases janus kinase (JAK)2 and subsequent signal
transducers and activators (STAT)5, phosphoinositide-3
kinase and Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).
Activation of these pathways leads to changes in gene expres-
sion that promote progression along the megakaryocytic
pathway, ultimately leading to the release of platelets into
the peripheral circulation (Figure 1).16
The TPO receptor is found on megakaryocyte precursor
cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets, as well as on stem cells
and early bone marrow progenitor cells of all lineages.
Physiologic control ofTPO
production
There are no known physiologic sensors of the platelet count
or mass and studies have suggested that hepatic transcription
and translation of the TPO gene to be constant.17,18
TPO is
cleared by avid TPO receptors present on platelets and pos-
sibly megakaryocytes. Significantly elevated endogenous
TPO levels have been observed in disorders in which there
is diminished platelet production and therefore reducedTPO
clearance, although thrombopoietin levels are typically nor-
mal in patients with ITP. During times of normal or increased
platelet mass there is increased clearance of TPO leading to
normalization of TPO levels.19,20
First-generation recombinant
thrombopoietin
Since TPO was cloned in 1994 several TPO molecules
have been developed for clinical evaluation. The first
generation recombinant TPOs, recombinant human
thrombopoietin (rh TPO) and pegylated human recom-
binant megakaryocyte growth and development factor

(PEG-rHuMGDF), developed in 1995 have undergone
considerable preclinical and clinical studies. Platelet
count response to single dose administration of both
recombinant TPOs was demonstrated. A 5-day time lag
occurred, presumably due to TPO stimulation of early and
not late megakaryocyte precursors, with a peak platelet
count at 12 to 14 days, a log-linear dose response curve
and a return to baseline platelet count by day 28 with no
rebound thrombocytopenia.21,22
Promising clinical trial results were seen in the areas
of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, stem cell
transplantation, myelodysplastic syndromes21,23–28
and prior
to platelet apheresis.29
Recombinant TPO also showed effi-
cacy in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP);30
platelet counts rose dramatically in 3 of 4 patients who had
received 7 daily treatments with PEG-rHuMGDF. Follow-
ing on from these promising clinical trial results a large
safety study of PEG-rHuMGDF was undertaken in healthy
volunteers.31
Each volunteer was given a monthly dose
of either PEG-rHuMGDF or placebo for up to 3 months.
However, 13 of 535 subjects who received PEG-rHuMGDF
developed an anti-TPO antibody compared with none of
the 532 placebo-treated subjects. This antibody was later
found to be an IgG4
subclass and was cross reactive with
endogenous TPO neutralizing its activity and resulting in
severe thrombocytopenia (platelet counts 10 to 20 × 109
/L).
In 2 patients pancytopenia developed and some volunteers
required treatment with ciclosporin and rituximab to
eliminate the autoantibody and restore normal blood counts.
All volunteers subsequently recovered.22,31
Subsequent
analysis of 650 cancer chemotherapy patients treated with
PEG-rHuMGDF identified at least four who also developed
thrombocytopenia, believed to be due to auto-antibody
formation. No subject treated with rhTPO developed neu-
tralizing antibodies. However, clinical development of both
recombinant TPOs was ultimately discontinued and many
of the clinical studies undertaken between 1994 and 1999
remain unpublished.15
AlternativeTPO agonists
Due to the promising platelet responses of the first-genera-
tion agents, there has been focus on the development of safe
nonimmunogenic growth factors.These can be considered in 3
classes:TPO nonpeptide mimetics,TPO peptide mimetics and
TPO antibody mimetics. Each class has a unique structure and
therefore a unique mode of activation of theTPO receptor.This
review article focuses on eltrombopag, the most extensively
trialled drug of the TPO nonpeptide mimetic class.
Eltrombopag (SB497115)
Eltrombopag was first developed by Duffy et al following
the screening of libraries of small molecules using an assay
to identify structures that stimulate the TPO receptor-linked
transduction pathways.32,33
The libraries of small compounds
underwent further biological modification prior to entering
clinical trials with the sulfonate group being replaced by a
biphenyl carboxylate compound in order to yield higher oral
bioavailability.34
This class of molecule has several important characteris-
tics: Firstly it is extremely small (564.6 Da) and binds very
precisely to the TPO receptor. Secondly it is only able to do
this in humans and non-human primates,34
preventing efficacy
studies in other animal models. The species specificity is due
to the amino acid present at position 499 in the TPO receptor
transmembrane region (histidine in primates and leucine in
all other species). Thirdly eltrombopag appears to activate
the TPO receptor by binding to the transmembrane domain
unlike TPO (and TPO peptide mimetics) which bind to the
distal homology receptor domain.
Eltrombopag has high potency in in vitro assays for
activation of the STAT and MAPK signaling pathways.
It activates TPO receptor with kinetics similar to rhTPO
resulting in proliferation of TPO-dependent cell lines
and induces the differentiation of bone marrow precursor
cells. These activities of eltrombopag have been shown to
be dependent on the expression of TPO receptor. Because
eltrombopag does not bind to the same site onTPO receptor
asTPO this prevents competitive binding and allows eltrom-
bopag and TPO to have additive cell-signaling effects.34
Clinical studies with eltrombopag
Phase 1 clinical trials of an oral once daily capsule given to
73 healthy volunteers were first reported in 2007.35
A dose-
dependent increase in platelet count at doses of 30 mg or more
given daily for 10 days was reported, with no adverse events.
Furthermore, there was no evidence of rebound thrombo-
cytopenia following discontinuation of treatment. Platelet
function, as measured by platelet aggregation and activation,
was not affected by the administration of eltrombopag.35
Following the success of these phase I studies,
Eltrombopag is being studied at phase I/II and phase III in
ITP, chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, myelodys-
plastic syndrome (MDS) and hepatitis C infection.
Chronic ITP
A phase I/II study of 118 patients (in 44 centers) with refrac-
tory or relapsed chronic ITP was reported in 2007.This study

enrolled patients in a randomized, double blind, placebo-
controlled study to receive either placebo or eltrombopag at
30-mg, 50-mg, or 75-mg doses (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) for 6 weeks.
The primary endpoint was a platelet count above 50 × 109
/L
on day 43. Randomization was stratified for concomitant
steroid use, previous splenectomy and baseline platelet count.
Eltrombopag was well tolerated and achieved dose related
responses; the percentage of patients with a platelet count
above 50 × 109
/L on day 43 were 11%, 28%, 70% and 81%
for the placebo, 30 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg doses respectively.
The median platelet counts on day 43 for the groups receiving
30, 50, and 75 mg of eltrombopag were 26 × 109
/L, 128 ×
109
/L, and 183 × 109
/L, respectively; for the placebo group
the median platelet count was 16 × 109
/L.
Significantly, this trial demonstrated a decreased bleed-
ing tendency in those patients treated with higher doses of
eltrombopag; by day 15 over 80% of patients on higher
doses (50 mg and 75 mg) had an increased platelet count
with significantly less bleeding: During the 6-week trial, the
incidence of bleeding was 14%, 17%, 7% and 4% for the
placebo, 30-mg, 50-mg and 75-mg doses respectively.
The counts were maintained for the 6-week trial period but
returned to baseline on stopping treatment in the majority of
patients. In this study there was one reported death in a patient
with multiple co-morbidities, not felt to be related to the use
of eltrombopag. Eltrombopag was associated with minor
adverse events (eg, headaches in 20%) and was well toler-
ated. There were no other definite treatment-related adverse
events reported during the study. The incidence and severity
of adverse events were similar for all four study groups.
In a following phase II study, patients enrolled in the initial
6-week study were eligible to enter a long-term, open-label
extension study – EXTEND study (Eltrombopag Extended
Dosing Study). In this study, the drug was administered orally
daily aiming for a target platelet count of 50 to 200 × 109
/L,
and with the intention that concurrent ITP medications
(eg, corticosteroids) could be tapered. Interim analysis of
89 evaluable subjects with a treatment duration of 151 days
showed that of the 61 subjects (73%) with a baseline plate-
let count below 30 × 109
/L, 43 achieved a platelet count of
50 × 109
/L. Most were able to maintain this platelet count
elevation and showed a trend toward fewer bleeding events.36
Similar promising responses were reported in a multi-
national phase III randomized, placebo-controlled study of
110 patients with chronic ITP.37
The purpose of this study was
to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once daily
eltrombopag (50 mg) and to explore the efficacy of a dose
escalation to 75 mg. Patients with platelet counts less than
30 × 109
/L were randomized to either placebo (37 patients)
or oral eltrombopag 50 mg once daily (73 patients) in a
1:2 ratio. Dose escalation to 75 mg once daily was allowed
if the platelet count was less than 50 × 109
/l at 3 weeks
(33 of 74 patients). The primary endpoint was the number
of patients with a platelet count 50 × 109
/L at day 43.
At 6 weeks, the primary endpoint had been reached in
6 (16%) placebo and 43 (59%) eltrombopag treated patients.
Response was not affected by predefined study stratification
variables (baseline platelet count, previous splenectomy, con-
comitant ITP drugs) or by the number of previous treatments.
In addition the bleeding incidence was significantly lower
in the eltrombopag group with WHO grade 2–4 bleeding
observed in 16% of patients compared with 36% of placebo
patients (odds ratio 0.49 [95% confidence interval 0.26 to
0.89] P = 0.021).Again adverse events were infrequent with
no significant differences between the two groups. Slight
increases of liver enzymes were noted in 6 patients in the
eltrombopag group. Cataracts were closely monitored during
the study due to concerns raised in preclinical rodent studies
but no excess risk has been identified in any trial.37
Antiplatelet antibodies and thrombopoietin levels were
not assessed in these patients and it is unclear what effect
these variables will have on response to treatment. It has,
however, been suggested that thrombopoietic agents such
as eltrombopag may result in improved immune regulation
by regulatory T cells and these agents may restore immune
tolerance.38
Quality of life
The impact of eltrombopag on quality of life in chronic ITP
was evaluated in both the phase II and III study with no sig-
nificant difference found between placebo and treatment arms
and between responders and non-responders over the 6-week
time period.37
This is possibly due to the short follow-up and
small sample size for this secondary endpoint.
Health related questionnaires are now incorporated into a
number of the more recent clinical trials. In a survey completed
by 1542 respondents with chronic ITP, patients were willing
to accept significant risks of thromboembolic events, liver
abnormalities, and rebound thrombocytopenia for greater effi-
cacy benefit, as well as to avoid the use of corticosteroids.39
Hepatitis C related thrombocytopenia
McHutchison and colleagues reported in 2007 the results of a
multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled phase II
trial of eltrombopag versus placebo in 74 patients with chronic
hepatitis C infection who had compensated liver disease with a

toeltrombopag(30mg,50mg,or75mgdaily)orplacebodaily
for 4 weeks. All patients who completed 4 weeks of treatment
and reached a platelet count of 70 × 109
/L received antiviral
therapy (pegylated interferon with ribavarin) concomitant with
eltrombopag for 8 to 12 weeks.
The results showed that none of the patients in the placebo
arm reached the primary end point; however 20 of 23 patients
receiving 75 mg eltrombopag attained a platelet count 100 ×
109
/L. Compared with only 6% of the placebo group, 15 of 23
patients (or 65%) in the high-dose eltrombopag group were
able to complete 12 weeks of antiviral treatment without dose
interruptions because they had platelets 50 × 109
/L.
Themostfrequentadverseeventinthe4weekeltrombopag
phase was headache, reported by 3 patients on placebo, and
5, 3, and 4 patients on eltrombopag 30 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg,
respectively. There are no safety concerns to date, although
the combined numbers of patients treated are, to date, only in
the hundreds. Phase III clinical trials evaluating eltrombopag
in hepatitis C infection are in progress. Together they have a
target enrolment of over one thousand patients.40
Potential serious adverse effects
Eltrombopag appears to have very good short-term toler-
ability with no serious adverse events reported. However,
this drug has only been used in hundreds of patients and the
maximum duration of treatment with eltrombopag reported
is 151 days.15
Potential adverse effects include:
Antibody formation
There have been no reports of antibody formation (there is
no sequence homology with TPO).
Thrombosis or thrombocytosis
It has been suggested that ITP (and/or its treatment)
creates a prothrombotic state, possibly due to the large
number of new (and active) platelets being formed. In the
placebo-controlled ITP studies there has been no difference
reported in thrombotic events between treatment or placebo
arms.15
A comparative analyses of eltrombopag and TPO
on in vitro platelet function demonstrated that eltrombopag
stimulates platelet signal transduction with little or no
effect on overall platelet function, in contrast to TPO, which
significantly primes platelet activation.41
Rebound thrombocytopenia
In the phase III trial of chronic ITP in over 100 patients, plate-
let counts remained above 50 × 10 9
/L in approximately half
the patients for a week following discontinuation.They gener-
ally returned to baseline levels within 2 weeks of discontinu-
ing therapy. In 2 patients recurrence of bleeding symptoms
occurred with a decrease in platelet counts to 10 × 109
/L
and at least 10 × 109
/L lower than baseline value.37
Reticulin fibrosis
Bone marrow (BM) reticulin (without collagen fibrosis) may
be increased in patients with ITP. The presence of grade 1/2
reticulin was reported in the BM of up to 67% of patients
with ITP.42
Reticulin is a normal component of the bone
marrow and is commonly seen in patients with autoimmune
disorders. This is reversible, quite unlike collagen fibrosis.
Bone marrow examination was not a requirement of the ran-
domized clinical trials. However of 117 ITP patients exposed
to eltrombopag, 19 had bone marrow examinations (after a
median of 13 months of various treatments) and seven showed
fibrosis (5 reticulin and 2 collagen).15
A recent analysis of bone marrow biopsy reports in patients
within EXTEND, REPEAT and RAISE clinical trials has been
reported in abstract form.The reports of bone marrow biopsies
performed at any time prior to eltrombopag exposure were
reviewed. In the EXTEND study participants underwent bone
marrow biopsy after one year on treatment and these reports
were compared. There was no evidence of clinically relevant
BM abnormalities or clinical findings typically associated
with myelofibrosis in patients treated for up to 18 months
with eltrombopag. Systematic longitudinal evaluation of bone
marrows in EXTEND will provide meaningful data on the
incidence of fibrosis during long-term treatment.43
Increase in myeloblasts
Myelodysplastic syndrome is a clonal disorder with a pro-
pensity to malignant transformation, usually to acute myeloid
leukemia. Malignant hemopoietic cells are known to express
TPO receptors and there is a theoretical risk that TPO growth
factors may stimulate growth of malignant cells. However the
first generation TPOs used in patients with AML did not show
any increase in blast percentage or relapse rates.44
At present
there has been no reported case of increased blasts following
the use of eltrombopag. Equally there have been no reports
of stimulation of solid tumors in any trials. In vitro effects
of eltrombopag on proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation,
colony formation, and malignant self-renewal of bone mar-
row mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) of patients with AML
and MDS have however been assessed. Malignant BM-MNC
did not show increased proliferation, or increased clonogenic
capacity at concentrations of eltrombopag ranging from 0.1 to
30 µg/mL in vitro. Furthermore, eltrombopag was capable of

increasing megakaryocytic differentiation and formation of
normalmegakaryocyticcoloniesfromculturedcellsofpatients
with AML and MDS.45
Conclusion
The successful use of eltrombopag in patients with chronic
and often refractory ITP shows promise for this agent. At
present eltrombopag has been licensed for use in ITP by
the FDA and MHRA. It is available as 25-mg, 50-mg, or
75-mg tablets administered orally once daily. Since food
and divalent cations affect absorption, recipients should not
eat food 2 hours before or after ingesting eltrombopag, and
medications with divalent cations (eg, antacids or calcium)
should not be taken.An important limitation of eltrombopag
treatment is the time delay to platelet response (presumed
secondary to the kinetics of stimulating platelet production)
precluding its use in the management of acute bleeding when
an urgent platelet increase is required.
Because the long term adverse events remain unknown,
its current use may initially be restricted to the treatment
of chronic ITP. We await the reporting of the long-term
extension study in progress and postmarketing surveil-
lance in ITP should provide further information. Given the
unknown long-term safety of eltrombopag this re-opens
the debate as to whom we should be treating with chronic
ITP. Should we treat the absolute platelet count or just the
patient who bleeds? It is unclear whether bleeding pro-
pensity correlates with platelet size, maturity or specific
activity. Disease modifiers (eg, platelet granule content)
have not been identified.
At present the authors would support the use of eltrombopag
for “third line” treatment of patients with persistent or chronic
ITP. Typically such patients would have been refractory to pal-
liative treatments such as oral steroids and intravenous immuno-
globulin/anti D and would have usually been treated with either
splenectomyand/orrituximaborotherimmunosuppressiveagents
suchasmycophenolatemofetil,ciclosporin,anddanazol.Whether
