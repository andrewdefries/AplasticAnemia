Abstract
Background Young patients with degenerative cartilage
disease of the hip remain a challenge for the orthopaedic
surgeon. Different treatment options are available of which
uncemented hips are the most popular owing to long-term
concerns about cemented implants. As an alternative, we
have used a cemented hip design in combination with bone
impaction grafting in patients with acetabular defects.
Questions/purposes We therefore determined the survival
rates and radiological failures of cemented THA in patients
younger than 30 years and reported clinical scores, com-
plications and current state of the revised THAs.
Methods We retrospectively reviewed all 48 patients (69
hips) younger than 30 years at the time of surgery who had
a primary cemented THA performed between 1988 and
2004. Acetabular defects were reconstructed using bone
impaction grafting in 29 hips. Mean age at surgery was
24.6 years (range, 16–29 years). Revisions were docu-
mented, radiographs were analyzed, and the Kaplan-Meier
method was used to determine survival for different end
points. No patient was lost to followup, three patients (four
hips) had died. Minimum followup was 2 years (mean,
8.4 years; range, 2–18 years).
Results Eight hips were revised (three for infection and
ﬁve for aseptic loosening) and one hip dislocated for which
open reduction was necessary. One additional cup was
considered a radiographic failure. The 10-year survival was
83% (95% conﬁdence interval, 69%–92%) with revision
for any reason as the end point and 90% (95% conﬁdence
interval, 77%–96%) with revision for aseptic loosening.
Conclusions We found a high survival rate of these
cemented THA in young patients. In young patients with
acetabular bone defects we recommend reconstruction
using cemented implants with bone impaction grafting.

Introduction
THA restores hip function, relieves pain, is cost-effective,
and associated with high survival rates [10, 24]. Given this
experience indications for THA have now been extended to
younger ages including patients younger than 30 years [2–
4, 9, 12, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 28–30, 32]. However, most
patients under the age of 30 years with osteoarthritis have
some underlying disorder, such as developmental dysplasia
of the hip, Legg-Calve´-Perthes disease, or juvenile rheu-
matoid arthritis. Bone stock deﬁciencies and bone
deformations often are present and can be an additional
problem in achieving a stable and durable reconstruction.
Several options are available to deal with acetabular
defects in young patients. The most commonly used is
likely an uncemented cup and if necessary a reinforcement

ring, placed with or without bone grafts. Reported survival
rates (with revision as an endpoint) on uncemented hips in
patients younger than 30 years with a minimal followup of
10 years vary from 49% [31] to 90% [23]. We have pre-
ferred a cemented THA in our young patients and to
reconstruct any acetabular defects with bone impaction
grafting [25] in combination with a cemented cup.
The purpose of our study was to (1) determine survival
of cemented prostheses in patients younger than 30 years
and whether differences exist between hips placed with and
without acetabular bone impaction grafting; (2) determine
the clinical outcome of the surviving hips; (3) deﬁne
radiographic failures; and (4) determine complications and
current state of revisions.
Patients and Methods
We retrospectively reviewed all 48 patients (69 hips)
younger than 30 years of age who had primary cemented
THAs for primary or secondary osteoarthrosis between
April 1988 and May 2004. Indications for THA were
mainly osteonecrosis of the femoral head and juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis (Table 1). Nineteen hips had previous
surgeries at the hip. We excluded patients who had
reconstruction for tumors. There were 32 female (46 hips)
and 16 male patients (23 hips) with a mean age at operation
of 24.6 years (range, 16.0–29.0 years). Twenty-one bilat-
eral THAs were performed, and in two of these patients,
the procedure was completed in a single surgery. Three
patients (four hips) died 1.4, 8.6 and 9.1 years after oper-
ation but they were evaluated at the outpatient clinic on a
regular basis until their deaths and the data were included
in the analyses. One patient with Crohn’s disease died of
sepsis after colorectal surgery and another patient died
because of aplastic anemia. The cause of death of a patient
with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was not known. The
minimum followup was 2 years (mean, 8.4 years; range
2–18 years). No patient was lost to followup.
A posterolateral approach was used in all hips without a
trochanteric osteotomy. Acetabular defects were classiﬁed
according to system of the American Academy of Ortho-
paedic Surgeons (AAOS) Committee on the Hip [6]. A
Type I defect was seen in ﬁve hips, a Type II defect in 16
hips, and a Type III defect in eight hips. A metal mesh was
used in 14 hips to reconstruct a segmental defect. The
remaining cavitary defect was reconstructed with bone
impaction grafting. This technique has been reported in
detail [25]. Twenty-nine of the 69 hips had acetabular
impaction grafting using femoral head autografts in 23
hips. Fresh-frozen, nonirradiated femoral head allografts
were used in three hips with a Type III defect, using one or
two femoral heads. In three hips, both autografts and an
allograft femoral head were used. Second-generation
cementing technique was applied in all hips. All patients
received systemic prophylactic antibiotics (2 g cefazolin)
immediately before surgery.
Several types of femoral and acetabular components
were used (Table 2). Sizes of femoral heads used were
22 mm (9 hips), 28 mm (49 hips) and 32 mm (11 hips).
Before 1989, Palacos1
bone cement (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) was used and Surgical Simplex1
(Stryker) from
1989 on.
Postoperatively all patients had prophylactic anticoag-
ulation therapy for 6 weeks or 3 months after surgery.
Indomethacin was administered for 7 days to prevent het-
erotopic ossiﬁcation. After 24 hours, passive movements
were allowed, followed by ambulation with partial
weightbearing with two crutches. After 6 weeks, full

weightbearing was allowed. Patients with an acetabular
bone graft had a slightly altered protocol, allowing touch
weightbearing during the ﬁrst 6 weeks and from 6 to
12 weeks partial weightbearing allowing 50% of body
weight. Patients with extensive acetabular reconstructions
initially had a 6-week period of bed rest.
Patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at
6 and 12 weeks, at 6 months, at 1 year, and annually or
biannually thereafter. The Harris hip score (HHS) [13] and
the Oxford Hip Questionnaire Score (OHQS) [7] were used
for clinical evaluation. Based on preoperative radiographs
and the surgical reports, acetabular defects were classiﬁed
according to the system of the AAOS Committee on the
Hip [6].
Three of us (VB, RK, BWS) independently reviewed
serial radiographs to determine the structural quality of the
bone graft, radiolucencies and osteolysis, prosthesis
migration, socket tilting, and heterotopic ossiﬁcation. Graft
incorporation was deﬁned as the manifestation of a regular
radiodensity and trabecular bone structure throughout the
graft and host bone with a continuous trabecular pattern
according to Conn et al. [5]. Radiolucent lines more than
2 mm wide were described and were deﬁned as stable or as
progressive in time. Acetabular zones were identiﬁed using
the criteria of DeLee and Charnley [8] and a radiographic
failure was deﬁned as radiolucent lines in all three zones
and/or migration of 5 mm or more in any direction on the
AP-pelvic view relative to the interteardrop line. Radiolu-
cent zones on the femoral side were evaluated using the
method of Gruen et al. [11]. Loosening of the femoral
component was deﬁned using the criteria of Harris et al.
[14]. Deﬁnite loosening of the stem was deﬁned as the
appearance of a radiolucent line in all Gruen zones that did
not exist on the immediate postoperative radiographs, a
crack in the cement or fracture of the stem. Femoral
prosthetic subsidence was considered abnormal if it was
more than 2 mm [18]. Heterotopic ossiﬁcation was classi-
ﬁed according to Brooker et al. [1].
Followup radiographs were complete for 68 of the 69
hips; for one patient (one hip), a recent radiograph was not
available due to her pregnancy at the time of review.
Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis [15] was performed
for the whole group, as well as for hips with and without
acetabular bone impaction grafting. End points used were
revision of one or both components for any reason and
revision for aseptic loosening and radiographic loosening.
The log-rank test was used to compare survival of the bone
impaction group and the non-bone impaction group.
Results
Survivorship of the total group was 90% (95% CI, 77%–
96%) at 10 years with revision for aseptic loosening as the
end point (Fig. 1) (Table 3). With revision for aseptic
loosening as the end point, the primary cemented cups had
a survivorship of 87% (95% CI, 68%–95%) and the bone
impaction group 95% (95% CI, 72%–99%) at 10 years
(Fig. 2). No differences in survival between the primary
cemented and the bone impaction group were found. Eight
hips had been revised. Three hips were revised because of

septic loosening at 5.7, 7.3, and 7.8 years after the index
operation. In ﬁve hips, only a revision of the cup was
performed because of aseptic loosening after 2.3, 3.1, 4.1,
5.0 and 8.6 years. Two revised cases had impaction graft-
ing of which one patient had primary diagnosis juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis. No additional stem revisions were
performed.
The mean HHS of the 57 surviving hips in 37 living
patients was 89 (range, 55–100) and the mean OHQS was
19 (range, 12–42) after a minimum followup of 2 years
(mean, 8.4 years; range, 2–18 years). One patient with
juvenile arthritis had a HHS of 55 and an OHQS of 42 and
was limited in walking distance, unable to climb stairs, and
experienced moderate pain.
Progressive acetabular radiolucent lines were seen in six
of the 61 surviving hips: in one zone in four hips and in two
zones in two hips. Osteolysis was evident in three hips and
limited to one zone in two cases; the third case involved
two zones. Socket migration of more than 10 mm had
occurred in one hip. Tilting of the acetabular component
was seen in two patients, of which one was progressive the
latest years of followup. Heterotopic ossiﬁcation was seen
in 14 of the 61 surviving hips and was classiﬁed as Grade II
(11 hips) and Grade III (three hips). In THAs with bone
impaction grafting, incorporation of the graft was seen in
all hips (Fig. 3). None of the femoral components migrated
more than 2 mm. A radiolucent line with an osteolytic
lesion was seen in one hip in Gruen Zone 7; none of the
surviving femoral components had evidence of radio-
graphic loosening. One cup was considered loose, but
revision has not been performed yet because of absence of
complaints.
One patient (one hip) underwent an early reoperation
due to suspicion of infection but recovery was complete

after de´bridement and antibiotics. Two patients had a
traumatic dislocation of the prosthesis, and closed reduc-
tion was successful in one, but for the other operative
repositioning was needed. In one patient exploration of the
femoral nerve was performed because of neurological
deﬁcit. The proximal part of the nerve could not be
detected and recovery was incomplete. All eight revisions
were performed in our own institute and all patients were
followed after their revision. In seven hips, acetabular
reconstruction with bone impaction grafting at revision
surgery was performed and a cemented cup was placed. In
two of the three revisions of the stem, reconstruction of a
femoral defect was necessary using femoral bone impac-
tion grafting and a cemented ExeterTM
stem was inserted.
For the eight revised hips the mean postoperative HHS was
88 (range, 41–100) and the mean postoperative OHQS of
20 (range, 12–54) at a minimum followup of 1 year
(average, 4.5 years; range, 1–10 years).
Discussion
Degenerative cartilage disease of the hip in very young
patients is often secondary to an underlying disease.
Several options are available to deal with acetabular
defects in young patients. The most used is an uncemented
cup and if necessary a reinforcement ring, placed with or
without bone grafts. Since 1979 we have preferred to
reconstruct very young patients with a cemented THA, and
in case of bone deﬁciencies, bone impaction grafting in
combination with a cemented prosthesis. The purpose of
our study was to (1) determine survival of the prosthesis in
patients younger than 30 years and whether differences
exist between hips placed with and without acetabular
bone impaction grafting; (2) determine the clinical out-
come of the surviving hips; (3) deﬁne radiological failures;
and (4) determine complications and current state of
revisions.
We draw the reader’s attention to several limitations.
First is the use of multiple implant designs; however, all
types were cemented. As a referral center, we have not
referred cases to other hospitals and therefore we have
included all diagnoses and acetabular bone defects during
the time of the study except those who had an implant
based for tumors. Apart from the different implants there
was no selection bias since we used the same treatment
protocol in all patients, and in case of bone stock deﬁ-
ciencies, we reconstructed the defect with bone impaction
grafting. Further, no patients lost to followup, and we
therefore believe our data are reliable [22]. Second, our
study had a relatively large group (26%) of patients with
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. These patients are probably
less active compared to the other patients with a localized
osteoarthritis of the hip in our series [3, 28]. In the litera-
ture, not all studies have the same conclusion relative to the
outcome of THAs in rheumatoid arthritis, and in some
studies, the outcome of this subgroup has reportedly worse
outcomes relative to other plain osteoarthritic cases [4, 27].
Third, criteria for graft incorporation are difﬁcult to deﬁne
but Conn et al. [5] stated that graft incorporation was
deﬁned as the manifestation of a regular radiodensity and
trabecular bone structure throughout the graft and host
bone with a continuous trabecular pattern. In the present
series, acetabular bone grafting had been performed in 29
out of 69 cases and incorporation of the grafts was seen in
all cases on a consensus base by three of the authors. The
criteria used are still in debate in our department and future
research has to bring more detailed criteria.
Our standardized treatment protocol was associated with
a 10-year survival rate of 90% (95% CI, 77%–96%).
Especially in young patients, we need techniques and
implants with a proven long-term survival [20], and apart
from a series of patients with exclusively juvenile chronic
arthritis [4, 16, 17, 19, 23], there is limited literature
regarding the survivorship and complications of THA
surgery in patients younger than 30 years [2, 3, 9, 12, 20,
28–30] (Table 4). For the acetabular side, Torchia et al.
[30] reported a revision rate for the cemented acetabular
component of 43% at an average followup of 12.6 years.
Sochart and Porter [29] reported an acetabular rate of
revision for cemented cups of 30% at a mean followup of
20 years. Maric and Haynes [19] described a group of 17
hips, including four uncemented hips, and reported that 6%
of the acetabular components were revised after an average
followup of 9.3 years. We found a rate of revision of
11.6% for the acetabular component at a mean followup of
8.4 years.
We believe our protocol with bone impaction grafting
is a biologically attractive approach, resulting in resto-
ration of bone stock in these young patients. This can be
a great advantage for future revisions, as can be expected
in these young patients. We included in our data that
from all patients who underwent revision and found
reasonable functional scores except in one case. This
study reﬂects our large experience with this technique
[26] over a period of 16 years. Of the 130 total hip
arthroplasties we perform every year, we have annually
treated fewer than ﬁve patients younger than 30 years
and only after intensive discussion and patient consent.
Keeping in mind the high failure rates associated with
increased demands within this cohort [2–4, 9, 12, 19, 29,
30] we think a cautious approach of these young patients
is important.
Our results of cemented THA in patients younger than
30 years show a 10-year survival rate of 90% with end
point revision for aseptic loosening. Loosening was mainly
