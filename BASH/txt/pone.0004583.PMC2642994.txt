Abstract
Deletions spanning chromosome 5q31.2 are among the most common recurring cytogenetic abnormalities detectable in
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Prior genomic studies have suggested that haploinsufficiency of multiple 5q31.2 genes
may contribute to MDS pathogenesis. However, this hypothesis has never been formally tested. Therefore, we designed this
study to systematically and comprehensively evaluate all 28 chromosome 5q31.2 genes and directly test whether
haploinsufficiency of a single 5q31.2 gene may result from a heterozygous nucleotide mutation or microdeletion. We
selected paired tumor (bone marrow) and germline (skin) DNA samples from 46 de novo MDS patients (37 without a
cytogenetic 5q31.2 deletion) and performed total exonic gene resequencing (479 amplicons) and array comparative
genomic hybridization (CGH). We found no somatic nucleotide changes in the 46 MDS samples, and no cytogenetically
silent 5q31.2 deletions in 20/20 samples analyzed by array CGH. Twelve novel single nucleotide polymorphisms were
discovered. The mRNA levels of 7 genes in the commonly deleted interval were reduced by 50% in CD34+ cells from del(5q)
MDS samples, and no gene showed complete loss of expression. Taken together, these data show that small deletions and/
or point mutations in individual 5q31.2 genes are not common events in MDS, and implicate haploinsufficiency of multiple
genes as the relevant genetic consequence of this common deletion.

Introduction
Heterozygous deletions spanning two distinct regions on the long
arm of chromosome 5 are among the most common abnormalities
detectable by conventional cytogenetic analysis in de novo (6–20% of
patients) and therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)
(40% of patients) [1]. One region spans chromosome 5q33.1 (148.6–
151.1 Mb) and is associated with the 5q minus syndrome, while the
other spans chromosome 5q31.2 (136.3–138.6 Mb) and is associated
with both de novo MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that
progresses from MDS (Figure 1A) [2,3,4,5,6]. The chromosome
5q31.2 region contains 23 annotated genes, 1 pseudogene, 3 small
RNAs, and 1 predicted genes (SPOCK1, KLHL3, HNRPA0, NPY6R,
MYOT, PKD2L2, C5orf5, WNT8A, NME5, BRD8, KIF20A, CDC23,
GFRA3, CDC25C, FAM53C, JMJD1B, REEP2, EGR1, ETF1,
HSPA9, SNORD63, LOC391836, LOC729429, CTNNA1, LRRTM2,
SIL1, MATR3, SNORA74A) [5,6].
Prior studies have suggested that haploinsufficiency of multiple
genes is the disease mechanism associated with deletions spanning
5q31.2. However, these studies were primarily designed to identify
biallelic gene mutations by analyzing the residual non-deleted
5q31.2 allele using MDS samples, AML samples, or cell lines
containing a cytogenetically visible 5q31.2 deletion, and they only
examined 20 of the 28 5q31.2 genes [6,7,8,9,10]. Therefore, these
studies did not adequately address the possibility that haploinsuf-
ficiency of a single 5q31.2 gene could arise from a heterozygous
point mutation, or small microdeletion, in a 5q31.2 gene in MDS
samples lacking a cytogenetic del(5q). Finding a heterozygous
nucleotide mutation or microdeletion in a single 5q31.2 gene in
MDS patients without evidence of del(5q) would expedite our
understanding of the pathogenesis conferred by large deletions.
To address the possibility that haploinsufficiency of a single 5q31.2
gene may occur in MDS, we performed a comprehensive and
systematic screen using total exonic resequencing and array
comparative genomic hybridization to evaluate all 28 genes in the
5q31.2 interval from 46 MDS patients (37 lacking a 5q31.2 deletion).
Our data indicate that loss of one copy of chromosome 5q31.2 genes
in de novo MDS occurs predominantly through large cytogenetic

deletions involving many genes, not a single gene, and suggest that
haploinsufficiency of multiple chromosome 5q31.2 genes is likely to
be the relevant genetic consequence of this common deletion.
Materials and Methods
Human subjects
Forty-six adult patients (age .18 years) with de novo MDS (no
prior malignancy, antecedent chemo- or radiotherapy) were
enrolled in a study at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington
University to identify genetic factors contributing to MDS
initiation and progression. Approval was obtained from the
Washington University institutional review board for these studies.
After obtaining written informed consent, a bone marrow sample
was obtained for analysis of tumor cells, and a 6-mm punch biopsy
of skin was obtained for analysis of unaffected somatic cells. Bone
marrow DNA was prepared using the QIAamp DNA mini kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and skin DNA was prepared using a
standard phenol/chloroform extraction followed by an ethanol
precipitation protocol.
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization
Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was per-
formed using paired tumor (bone marrow) and germline (skin)

of the data, each data point on the plot represents the average log2 ratio for consecutive probes in a 20,000 base pair region (median number of
probes per bin = 46). The dashed lines indicate the 5q31.2 and 5q33.1 CDS locations depicted in panel A. C. (Upper panel) Whole chromosome 5 log2
ratio (test/reference) plot for sample #176267. An interstitial deletion on chromosome 5 produces a negative log2 ratio for probes located within the
deletion. The deletion boundaries are indicated by the arrowheads. The deletion spans from base 86,152,517–155,672,191 (determined using
segMNT). The log2 ratio deviation for the segment is consistent with the deletion of one allele. Sample #176267 contains del(5q) in 20/20 bone
marrow cell metaphases (100%), and has a blast count of 7%. (Lower panel) Chromosome 5 log2 ratio (test/reference) plot for sample #176267 from

Gene Resequencing in MDS
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 2 | e4583
genomic DNA samples (non-whole genome amplified DNA) from
20 of the 46 MDS samples that we resequenced (5/20 samples
contain deletions spanning 5q31.2). These 20 samples were chosen
because of sample abundance. We used a custom array CGH
platform (Roche NimbleGen Systems, Inc.) containing 385,297
long oligomer (average length 51 nucleotides) probes spanning
human chromosome 5 (median probe spacing ,500 base pairs).
Labeling, hybridization, washing, and scanning were performed as
previously described [11]. The log2(test/reference) signals were
analyzed using a circular binary segmentation algorithm
(segMNT) [12] and a hidden Markov model (wuHMM) [13] to
identify somatically acquired segmental DNA copy number
changes. To call a copy number change, both algorithms required
a segment to span a minimum of 5 consecutive probes. Full access
to the primary array data and MIAME description are available at
http://bioinformatics.wustl.edu.
Sequencing and Pyrosequencing
Sequencing and Pyrosequencing methods have been previously
described [14,15].
Expression profiling
CD34+ cells were purified using the autoMACS system
(Miltenyi). Total RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA), processed, and hybridized to the human
Affymetrix U133plus2 array by the Siteman Cancer Center
Microarray Core Facility at Washington University according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (see http://pathbox.wustl.edu/
,mgacore/genechip.htm for a complete list of protocols). In order
to perform interarray comparisons, the data for each array was
scaled to a target intensity of 1,500 using Affymetrix Microarray
Suite software.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using total RNA
extracted from CD34+ cells and the one-step Assays-on-Demand
kit (Applied Biosystems). All samples were run in duplicate.
Individual cDNA samples were normalized according to their
levels of beta actin transcript. The comparative Ct method was
used for analysis.
Statistical analysis
Differences in allele frequency were evaluated using Fisher’s
Exact test. Genotype associations were further evaluated for
significance according to codominant, dominant, and overdomi-
nant genetic models by Chi-square testing. Results were corrected
for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method. Gene
expression profiling results were compared using a two-tailed t-
test.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 46 patients with de novo MDS samples were chosen for
study based on availability of high quality, abundant, paired bone
marrow (tumor) and skin (germline) DNA samples (Table 1).
Paired samples allowed us to distinguish somatic mutations from
germline polymorphisms. Thirty-seven of the 46 patients did not
have a chromosome 5q31.2 deletion by cytogenetics. Seven of the
9 patients with monosomy 5 or del(5q) had complex cytogenetics,
and none of the 37 non-del(5q) patients had clinical evidence of 5q
minus syndrome (Table S1). Cases were classified in accordance
with the French-American-British (FAB) system upon diagnosis
and banking of their bone marrow specimens. The patients
include refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts
(RARS), RA with excess blasts (RAEB), RAEB in transformation
(RAEB-T), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), with
a median International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score of
1 (range 0–3), and a median blast count of 4.5% (range 0–26%).
The 46 bone marrow samples were independently reviewed by a
hematopathologist (JLF) and 6 cases were reclassified as acute
myeloid leukemia in the World Health Organization system
(Table S1). The 20 MDS samples analyzed using array CGH
were chosen from the 46 MDS samples used for the resequencing
studies, and had a median IPSS score of 2 (range 0–3), and a
median blast count of 10% (range 1–26%) (Table 1 and Table
S1).
Array comparative genomic hybridization
To complement the sequence-based studies, we used array
comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to measure DNA copy
number across chromosome 5 that might be missed by
cytogenetics or resequencing. We detected chromosome 5
deletions using the array CGH platform in 4/5 samples that were
known to have del(5q) using cytogenetics (Figure 1, and data not
shown). Array CGH did not detect del(5q) in one MDS sample
that had 1/20 metaphases with a del(5)(q22q34) (Figure 1). This
is consistent with our analysis of AML samples in which array
CGH rarely detects copy number changes if the neoplastic clone
comprises ,25% of bone marrow cells (judged by the percent
abnormal metaphases) (Walter, et al., submitted). None of the
del(5q) samples had detectable deletions on the remaining wild-
type chromosome (Figure 1, and data not shown), and no
cytogenetically silent microdeletions were detected in the non-
del(5q) samples (data not shown).
Nucleotide changes in 28 chromosome 5q31.2 genes
To define the limit of detection for this DNA resequencing
platform, we screened 90 MDS samples for FLT3 internal tandem
duplications (ITD) using standard agarose gel electrophoresis and
the Agilent LabChip. We detected 3 ITD+ samples and chose one
for further analysis. We performed 6 serial dilutions of the ITD+
MDS DNA with FLT3 wild-type genomic DNA and performed
PCR amplification followed by DNA sequencing of the PCR
products. We could detect the FLT3 ITD when 12% of the alleles
harbored the mutation, or when ,20–25% of cells contain a
heterozygous mutation (data not shown).
We designed and validated primers on control DNA templates
for 479 amplicons covering the coding region and proximal
introns of all 28 genes in the 5q31.2 interval (see Table S2 for
primer sequences). We then produced 7.5 megabases of double-
stranded sequence for these 28 genes in the 46 samples. To ensure
comprehensive coverage of all 28 genes, we performed bidirec-
tional sequencing of amplicons and systematically tracked whether
each coding nucleotide in all 28 genes was covered once or twice
in the 46 samples. On average, 94% of all coding bases were
covered, and 88% of bases were sequenced on both strands
(Table 2). Only 10 amplicons failed to produce adequate
sequence coverage using our resequencing pipeline, and 7 of
these yielded high quality sequence after primers were redesigned.
One exon in NME5, CTNNA1, and LOC729429 failed for all 46
samples, accounting for their low percent coverage (Table 2).
A semiautomated analysis pipeline was used to identify
sequence variants [14]. We restricted our analysis to nonsynon-
ymous and splice site nucleotide changes. Variants not found in
dbSNP (build 129) were resequenced in bone marrow and paired
germline (skin) samples. No somatic nonsynonymous or splice site
mutations were detected in the 28 genes (Table 2). However, 12

novel SNPs were identified (Table 3). Nine of these were
nonsynonymous, including a stop codon in PKD2L2, and 3
occurred in non-coding genes. The minor allele frequency for
these 12 SNPs was 1.1–4.7% in this MDS population.
SNP frequencies of the 28 chromosome 5q31.2 genes in
MDS vs. race-matched controls
To assess whether germline alleles of chromosome 5q31.2 genes
are associated with MDS, we compared both the allele and
genotype frequencies of all known SNPs in these genes (23
nonsynonymous, 19 synonymous, and 5 from non-coding genes) in
the 45 MDS patients of European ancestry from our cohort to
race-matched HapMap controls. The minor allele frequency for
16/47 SNPs was less than 5% in all MDS or race-matched control
samples, leaving 31 SNPs that could be analyzed with this sample
size (Table S3). The minor allele frequencies of two coding SNPs
were significantly over-represented in MDS cases vs. race-matched
controls: rs3734166 (CDC25C R70C) (OR 1.836, 95% conf 1.030–
3.272, p = 0.048), and rs2905608 (KLHL3 A157A) (OR 99.47,
95% conf 5.914–1673, p = 2.187E-10). We used pyrosequencing
to genotype 190 additional samples from normal individuals of
European descent (cancer free controls from Washington Univer-
sity, and HD100 controls) for SNPs rs3734166 and rs2905608.
There was no significant difference in allele or genotype
frequencies for rs3734166 (p = 0.246, p = 0.450, respectively) and
rs2905608 (p = 0.214, p = 0.182, respectively) after pooling all
available control data (Table 4). This study was powered to detect
changes in minor allele frequencies that occurred in at least 10%
of MDS cases, therefore, race-matched control samples were not
genotyped for the 12 novel SNPs identified in our 46 MDS
samples because they occurred at such low frequencies (1.4–4.7%).
SNP loss of heterozygosity in del(5q) samples
To assess whether preferential retention of a SNP allele
occurred in the 9 monosomy 5 or del(5q) samples, we examined
their sequence traces for 64 SNPs (12 SNPs in Table 3, 47 SNPs
in Table S3, and 5 SNPs without race-matched control data).
DNA extracted from a homogeneous population of tumor cells
harboring a deletion of one copy of chromosome 5q31.2 will
contain complete loss of heterozygosity for all SNPs in 5q31.2
genes that are heterozygous in the germline. Sequence traces from
these bone marrow samples display only one peak at each SNP,
which represents the retained SNP allele in the tumor cells
(Figure 2). In contrast, DNA extracted from a heterogeneous
population of cells containing both tumor cells with a del(5q), and
normal cells without del(5q), produce sequence traces displaying
two alleles of unequal peak heights indicating allele skewing. There
were 5 SNPs that had allele skewing in 3 or more del(5q) samples,
but 0/5 SNPs displayed uniform retention of the same allele (data
not shown).
To address the possibility that the cellular heterogeneity present
in MDS bone marrow samples could limit the use of unfraction-
ated cells for DNA based genomic studies, we used the SNP
resequencing data to determine whether we could detect clonality

in MDS bone marrow samples that had less than 5 percent
myeloblasts. We calculated the allele trace peak height ratio (peak
height of allele A/(peak heights of alleles A+B)) for biallelic SNPs
in tumor DNA samples (bone marrow). The allele peak height
ratio was considered abnormal, indicating allelic imbalance, if the
ratio was $0.7 or #0.3 (Figure 2). The del(5q) samples had bone
marrow myeloblast counts ranging from 0–17%, and an abnormal
chromosome 5q31.2 in 5–100% of their bone marrow cell
metaphases. The SNP allelic frequencies were highly correlated
with the percent of abnormal metaphases in 8 del(5q) samples
(r = 0.9385, p = 0.0006), indicating that the sequencing data
accurately reflects clonality (Figure 2). In contrast, the bone
marrow myeloblast count is a poor surrogate for clonality. Even at
blast counts less than 5 percent, clonal cells are detected using the
SNP peak height skewing data, implying that the majority of bone
marrow cells may be clonal even when samples have low bone
marrow myeloblast counts (Figure 2).
Gene expression levels
To assess whether del(5q) gene expression may be affected by
mechanisms other than coding or splice site DNA mutations (i.e.,
mutations in non-coding DNA or epigenetic alterations), we
compared the mRNA levels of 28 del(5q) genes in CD34+ purified
cells from 6 MDS patients with del(5q), 20 MDS patients without
del(5q), and 6 normal donors using the Affymetrix U133plus2
array. Four of the 28 genes did not have a probeset on the array
(HNRPA0, LOC391836, LOC729429, SNORD63). The remaining
24 genes were rank ordered based on their median mRNA
expression level (Affymetrix units) in the 6 control samples, and the
average expression level of a gene for MDS patients with del(5q)

(n = 6) and MDS patients without del(5q) (n = 20) was plotted
relative to the level in control samples (Table S4, Figure 3). Nine
of the 24 genes were called absent in 70–100% of all 32 samples
(colored red in Figure 3). Consistent with haploinsufficiency, 7
genes had a significant reduction in average signal intensity in
MDS samples with del(5q) compared to control samples (0.47
average fold change for MATR3, HSPA9, FAM53C, ETF1,
CTNNA1, JMJD1B, and KLHL3 relative to control samples,
p,0.04) and compared to MDS samples without del(5q) (0.52
average fold change relative to non-del(5q) samples, p,0.02
excluding FAM53C). No gene had mRNA levels in del(5q)
samples consistently below the expected haploinsufficient level of
50%, indicating that biallelic loss of expression is not common in
CD34+ samples containing del(5q). However, FAM53C and
ETF1 were expressed at significantly lower levels in MDS samples
without del(5q) compared to control samples (0.47 and 0.79 fold
change relative to control, respectively, p#0.03), suggesting that
these genes might be altered in the absence of a cytogenetic

probesets on the Affymetrix U133plus2 array using total RNA extracted from CD34+ purified cells from 6 MDS patients with del(5q), 20 MDS patients
without del(5q), and 6 normal control individuals. Genes were rank ordered based on the median signal intensity in control samples. The average

were averaged (probesets were included in the average signal if they were present in at least 4 of 6 control samples and had a median expression in
controls greater than 1,500, the scaled target intensity of arrays). If all probesets were called absent for a gene, the highest median expressing

deletion. To verify this possibility, we performed quantitative RT-
PCR for FAM53C using available total RNA from CD34+ cells.
Quantitative RT-PCR did not confirm the Affymetrix array results
for haploinsufficiency of FAM53C (data not shown). Quantitative
RT-PCR was not performed for ETF1 because only 1 of 2
probesets on the array showed reduced expression in non-del(5q)
samples. In summary, of the 15 chromosome 5q31.2 genes with
detectable expression by microarray, none was consistently
expressed out of proportion to gene dosage.
Discussion
In this study, we determined by high-throughput resequencing
and array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) that point
mutations and small deletions in chromosome 5q31.2 genes are
not common events in de novo MDS. A critical aspect of this study
design is that the nucleotide sequence and copy number for all of
the genes in the commonly deleted segment were examined
comprehensively in a large number of MDS patients without
del(5q). These results therefore demonstrate that a cytogenetic
deletion spanning the commonly deleted segment on chromosome
5q31.2 is the predominant genetic event leading to haploinsuffi-
ciency of multiple del(5q) genes. These results also imply that the
simultaneous loss of multiple genes may be necessary for disease
initiation and progression of del(5)(q31.2) associated MDS and
AML.
Haploinsufficiency of three 5q31.2 candidate genes (HSPA9,
CTNNA1, EGR1) may contribute to disease pathogenesis, but
current data suggests that these genes individually do not
recapitulate all features of MDS [8,16,17]. Zebrafish carrying an
ENU-induced heterozygous mutation in the ortholog of the
human HSPA9 gene display increased apoptosis in blood cells
characteristic of ineffective hematopoiesis [16]. Look and
colleagues found that decreased CTNNA1 expression in
CD34+CD38-CD123+Lin- cells from high risk del(5q) associated
MDS or AML patients was associated with methylation of the
CTNNA1 promoter, but not with point mutations of the residual
allele in primary tumor cells [8]. However, others found no
reduction in CTNNA1 mRNA levels below 50% in CD34+CD38-
Thy1+ cells from low risk del(5q) MDS patients [18]. Most
recently, Le Beau and colleagues observed that Egr1 heterozygous
mutant mice have normal resting hematopoiesis, but develop
myeloid diseases after treatment with ENU [17]. Collectively, the
data implicate that more than one gene is likely to be involved in
the pathogenesis of MDS, and support the hypothesis that
haploinsufficiency of multiple 5q31.2 genes contributes to MDS
initiation or progression.
It is unlikely that a recurrent, clonally dominant, genetic event
(mutation, gene silencing, or polymorphism) in these 28 genes was
not detected in this de novo MDS cohort due to cellular
heterogeneity or sample size. Although cellular heterogeneity in
MDS bone marrow samples exists, our resequencing (Figure 2)
and array CGH (Figure 1) results confirm findings from previous
studies using interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for
del(5q), which concluded that the myeloblast count often
underestimates the proportion of cells that are clonally derived
in MDS [19,20,21]. In addition, by sequencing 37 MDS samples
without del(5q), there is a 0.9543 probability of detecting a 5q31.2
gene mutation if it occurs in at least 8% of MDS samples without a
cytogenetic del(5q). Furthermore, we found no evidence of biallelic
loss of mRNA expression of del(5q) genes in CD34+ cells harvested
from our MDS patients with del(5q), and we found no SNP
significantly associated with MDS or evidence of preferential
retention of a residual SNP allele in MDS samples with del(5q).
Collectively, our data provides direct evidence supporting the
hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of multiple genes in the
commonly deleted segment is the most likely relevant genetic
consequence of deletions spanning chromosome 5q31.2. Moving
forward and testing the hypothesis of haploinsufficiency as a
disease mechanism is difficult, and using mouse models is
problematic. The syntenic chromosome 5q31.2 region in mouse
resides on two chromosomes, making it difficult to accurately
engineer a complete knockout of all the genes at once. In addition,
creating individual targeted knockout mice for each candidate
gene is time-consuming, cost-prohibitive, and impractical. How-
ever, it is now possible to perform comprehensive high-throughput
gene knockdown screens using RNAi technology to model
haploinsufficiency because lentiviral short hairpin libraries exist
[22,23]. This approach has yielded important information for the
RPS14 gene located in the chromosome 5q33.1 commonly deleted
segment in patients with the 5q minus syndrome [24], and this
technology will expand our understanding of single gene and gene
combinations that may contribute to disease initiation in MDS
and AML. Ultimately, identifying the genetics events leading to
MDS initiation may provide insight into targeted therapy for
MDS and AML.
