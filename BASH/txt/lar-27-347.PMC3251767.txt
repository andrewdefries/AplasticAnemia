Feline endometrial adenocarcinomas are uncommon malignant neoplasms that have been poorly
characterized to date. In this study, we describe a uterine adenocarcinoma in a Persian cat with feline
leukemia virus infection. At the time of presentation, the cat, a female Persian chinchilla, was 2 years old.
The cat underwent surgical ovariohystectomy. A cross-section of the uterine wall revealed a thickened
uterine horn. The cat tested positive for feline leukemia virus as detected by polymerase chain reaction.
Histopathological examination revealed uterine adenocarcinoma that had metastasized to the omentum,
resulting in thickening and the formation of inflammatory lesions. Based on the histopathological findings,
this case was diagnosed as a uterine adenocarcinoma with abdominal metastasis. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report of a uterine adenocarcinoma with feline leukemia virus infection.

Uterine adenocarcinomas have been reported in most
domestic species but are considered rare except in rabbits
and cows [1]. The prevalence of uterine adenocarcinoma
in rabbits after 5 years of age has been reported to be 79%
[2].Becauserabbitsareinducedovulatorsthatareoftenhoused
individually, laboratory rabbit and possibly many pet rabbits
are under almost constant estrogen stimulation. Virgin rats
haveasimilarhighincidenceofendometrialadenocarcinomas
[3]. Cats, another species that exhibit induced ovulation, may
also be subjected to long periods of unopposed estrogen
stimulation, but the frequent practice of neutering queens,
and the tendency to periodically breed or induce ovulation
in sexually intact queens, may explain the low prevalence
of endometrial adenocarcinoma in cats [4]. In women,
postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, estrogen in
particular, is considered a risk factor for endometrial
adenocarcinoma; both estrogen-dependent and higher-grade
estrogen-independent adenocarcinomas are recognized [5].
Viruses cause cancer in amphibians, fish, fowl, rodents,
cats, cattle, and subhuman primates, and if humans were
to be exempt from such a general biological phenomenon,
it would be a circumstance unparalleled in the history of
parasitism. In fact, evidence is accumulating that some human
cancers are virally induced. For example, Burkitt's lymphoma,
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cervical cancer, and Kaposi's
sarcoma are thought to be caused by herpesviruses, which
are able to remain latent in the host for many years [6].
Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is an exogenous retrovirus,
belonging to the genus Gammaretrovirus, which infects
domestic cats and, sporadically, wild cats as well [7,8]. FeLV
causes a wide range of proliferative diseases in cats, including
lymphoid and myeloid leukemia [9].
Feline endometrial adenocarcinomas are uncommon
malignant neoplasms that have to date been poorly
characterized. In this study, a case of uterine adenocarcinoma
case is described in a Persian cat with FeLV infection. At
the time of presentation, the cat was a 2-year-old female
Persian chinchilla (Figure 1A). She presented with vaginal
discharge and interrupted vomiting, and was given a health
examination. Abdominal sonography and radiography

demonstrated abnormal enlargement of the uterus in the
abdominal cavity. The blood analysis revealed neutrophilia
and lymphopenia. The concentrations of progesterone and
estrogen in blood were evaluated and the results revealed
normal ranges. The cat underwent surgical ovariohystectomy.
During the laparotomy, thickening and inflammatory lesions
of the omentum and spleen were observed (Figure 1B). The
results of bacterial culture with omentum and spleen samples
were negative for pathogenic bacteria. The ovariouterus and
the omentum were removed surgically, submitted to gross
examination, and trimmed. Cross-sections of the uterine wall
revealed a thickening of uterine horn (Figure 2). Additionally,
yellowish contents were observed in the lumen of the uterus.
The trimmed tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin and embedded in paraffin. Four-micrometer sections
were made and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
for histopathological examination. The histopathological
analysis revealed adenocarcinomain the uterus and omentum
(Figure 3), but no pathological changes were observed in
the ovary. The adenocarcinoma had metastasized to the
omentum, resulting in thickening and the formation of
inflammatory lesions (Figure 4). Based on these histo-
pathological findings, the case was diagnosed as uterine
adenocarcinoma with abdominal metastasis. The cat made
a complete recovery following an ovariohysterectomy and

Genomic DNA extraction kit (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA was
eluted in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH8.0), and an aliquot was used
for PCR amplification. All DNA samples were stored at
−20o
C until the PCR assays were performed. The template
DNA (50 ng) and 20 pmol of each primer were added to
a PCR mixture tube (AccuPower PCR PreMix; Bioneer)
containing 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 250 µM each
deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.3), 40
mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and the gel loading dye. The final
volumewasadjustedto20 µLwithdistilledwater.Thereaction
mixture was subjected to denaturation at 95o
C for 2 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 95o
C for 30 sec (denaturation), 54o
C
for 30 sec (annealing), and 72o
C for 30 sec (extension), and
a final extension step of 72o
C for 5 min, and samples were
kept at 4o
C until analysis. Reactions were conducted using
My Genie 32 Thermal Block PCR (Bioneer). Eight microliters
of each sample were mixed with 2 µL of loading buffer, and
electrophoretically separated on 1.2% agarose gels stained
with0.5 µg/mLethidiumbromide.DNAbandswereobserved

FCV, Heart worm, Feline Chlamydia, Toxoplasma, Babesia
spp., Ehrlichia spp., Haemobartonella felis, Rickettsia spp. and
Brucella spp. We were able to visualize bands that were
529 base pairs in length, corresponding to the FeLV amplicon
(Figure 5); other feline pathogens tested negative in the PCR
assay (Figure 5).
Significant changes in the structure of the endometrium
are associated with degeneration of luminal epithelium, cystic
endometrial hyperplasia, pyometra, and adenocarcinoma
[22]. Endometrial tumors of the uterus are rare in domestic
animals [23]. Adenocarcinoma of the uterus is very rare in
animals, in marked contrast to the prevalence of this tumor
in human females [23]. The basic mechanisms associated
withthesechangesarepoorlyunderstood.Prolongedexposure
to megestrol acetate has been associated with endometrial
hyperplasia and pyometra in domestic cats, and progestin
contraceptives may have similar effects on zoo felids [24,25].
Megestrol acetate is a derivative of progesterone and used
commonly both in contraception and hormone replacement
therapy [26]. Based on available clinical and epidemiological
data, it has been long suspected that tumors of the canine
female genital tract develop under the influence of ovarian
hormones [22]. In this case, however, the animal had not
beengivenaprogesteronederivativesuchasmegestrolacetate.
FeLV is an exogenous retrovirus causing several diseases
in domestic cats, including tumors of most hematopoietic
cells, aplastic anemia, myeloproliferative disorders, and
immunosuppression [27]. The FeLVs that primarily cause T-
cell tumors in cats are transmitted in a horizontal manner
[28], particularly through saliva [29]. The T-cell tropism of
these agents is observed even when the virus infects human
cells [30]. Although many free-roaming cats become
persistently infected with FeLV, only a small fraction develops
leukemia or lymphoma. A large number develop lethal
opportunistic infections, particularly coronavirus-induced
peritonitis [31]. FeLV causes lymphopenia, depressed cell-
mediated immune responses, thymic atrophy, and depressed
humoral responses to T-cell dependent antigens despite the
presence of hypergammaglobulinemia [31].
In this study, the cat had uterine adenocarcinoma without
pathognomic ovarian lesions or significant hormonal
imbalances. The cat also suffered from FeLV infection and
lymphopenia. We believe that the uterine adenocarcinoma
in this case was probably related to immunogenic depression
by FeLV infection, although we cannot rule out the
contributions of other factors, such as old age, to the induction
of this tumor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report of feline uterine adenocarcinoma with feline leukemia
virus infection.
