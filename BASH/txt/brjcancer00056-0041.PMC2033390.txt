Summanr A number of different alkvlating chemotherapeutic agents - busulphan. dimethylbusulphan
(DMB). isopropylmethane sulphonate (IMS). melphalan. cyclophosphamide (CY) and bischloroethylnitro-
sourea (BCNU) - were investigated for their cytotoxic effects on different haemopoietic cell populations in
host mice and for their abilitv to induce short-and long-term engraftment of transplanted bone marrow. At
24 h after drug treatment the femoral content of transient and permanent repopulating stem cell subsets was
assessed. respectively. from the frequency of early- (day 5-15) and late- (day 25-35) developing cobblestone
area-forming cells (CAFCs). growing in vitro in long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs). At this time a
fixed complement of 10 congenicallv marked donor bone marrow cells (B6-Gpi-10-* B6-Gpi-PI) was infused in
the drug-treated mice and erythroid engraftment was followed over 36 weeks. Diverse effects on early- and
late-developing CAFC frequencies were found for the different drugs: these were generally related to the
pattern of donor bone marrow engraftment in treated recipients. Melphalan was more toxic to early-
developing than to late-developing CAFC subsets. and the transplant only offered an earlv wave of blood
chimerism followed bv return of host cells. CY and BCNU had minimal to moderate effects on CAFC content
and engraftment with no apparent preference for any particular haemopoietic cell subset. IMS also had a
relatively low toxic effect on host marrow CAFC frequencies but appeared exceptional in its ability to allow
for more donor-type engraftment. The dimethane sulphonate compounds busulphan and DMB were especially
potent at depleting late CAFC subsets and ensured high and lasting levels of donor bone marrow engraftment.
These studies support the value of CAFC measurements for predicting the fate and growth of transplanted
bone marrow cells in recipients pretreated with a variety of cytotoxic agents.
Many chemotherapeutic compounds currently in use for
treatment of malignant disease are well known for their acute
toxicity to the haemopoietic system. Proliferating progenitor
cells in the bone marrow are especially vulnerable and their
depletion leads to rapid loss of blood cell elements with the
serious consequences of infection. haemorrhage and anaemia.
These problems can now be largely ameliorated by an inter-
vening transplant of bone marrow or peripheral haemo-
poietic cells. which allows the opportunity to deliver higher
but tolerable doses of chemo- and or radiotherapy. Such a
strategy is being increasingly used against a number of re-
fractory malignancies, including leukaemias. lymphomas,
multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma and breast cancer (Armi-
tage, 1989: Kessinger & Armitage. 1991: Phillips et al.. 1991:
Bortin et al.. 1992a; Marks et al.. 1992; Hohaus et al.. 1993).
Transplant of normal haemopoietic stem cells also offers a
means to correct the various genetic diseases of the lym-
phohaemopoietic system such as sickle cell anaemia. thalas-
saemia and severe combined immunodeficiency (Rappeport et
al.. 1983: Barrett & McCarthy. 1990: Brochstein. 1992). Cen-
tral to the outcome of bone marrow transplantation (BMT)
in all these diseases are the relationships between the sen-
sitivity of different host haemopoietic cell subsets towards
certain cytotoxic treatments and the potential for repopula-
tion of composite cell subsets derived from the transplanted
donor marrow.
Experimnental studies in mice have often focused on the
importance of transplanting spleen colony-forming units
(CFU-S) for rapid repopulation and rescue of recipients from
the otherwise lethal acute effects of cytotoxic treatment.
However, recent investigations using donor marrow stem cell
separation techniques and radiation chimera models have
shown that most, if not all, CFU-S cells are limited to the
provision of transient short-term haemopoietic support.
whereas a more primitive and distinct stem cell subset
appears to be responsible for long-term repopulation (Ploe-

quantification of cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFCs)
growing in long-term bone marrow cultures has been used to
resolve different haemopoietic subsets in sorted marrow cell
fractions that correlate with the temporal development of
erythroid and leucocyte chimerism in irradiated transplant
recipients (Down & Ploemacher. 1993: Ploemacher et al..
1993). The heterogeneous nature of bone marrow stem cells
as demonstrated with in vitro CAFC and in vivo blood
chimerism assays has also been investigated under the
differential effects of host preparation with the drugs 5-
fluorouracil (5-FU) and busulphan (Down & Ploemacher.
1993). In this case both 5-FU and busulphan were toxic to
CAFCs developing early in culture (days 5-15) and neces-
sitated early engraftment on behalf of transiently
repopulating haemopoietic cells from the transplant. Never-
theless, only busulphan chemotherapy was capable of
depleting late- (day 25-35) developing CAFC subsets. and
this seemed to be essential for achieving lasting and high
levels of donor haemopoietic engraftment. The object of the
present study was to extend this experimental approach to
investigate other types of alkylating agents. most of which
are commonly included in high-dose chemotherapy regimens
prior to autologous or allogeneic BMT. These agents were
found to have diverse toxicities for the different cell subsets
of the haemopoietic hierarchy and offered a useful basis for
further comparison of donor blood chimerism in vivo with
pretransplant marrow CAFC survival as determined in
vitro.

congenic mice were used as a source of donor bone marrow.
Animals were housed in approved facilities free of known
pathogenic organisms (Sendai, MHV, PVM, GD VII, REO
III, EMC, LMC, MVM, K and Myecobacteria). Experiments
were performed in accordance with the Netherlands Experi-
ments on Animals Act (1977) and the European Convention
for the protection of vertebrate animals used for experiment-
al purposes (Strassbourg, 18 March 1986).
Treatment
All drugs were administered intraperitoneally immediately
after dissolution in volumes of 0.1 ml per 1Og body weight.
Cyclophosphamide (CY) (200 mg kg-'; Aldrich-Chemie, Stein-
heim, Germany), bischloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) (40 mg
kg-'; Bristol Laboratories, Syracuse, NY, USA) and iso-
propylmethane sulphonate (IMS) (100 mg kg-'; Paterson In-
stitute of Cancer Research, Manchester, UK) were dissolved
in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Melphalan (10 and
20 mg kg-'; The Weilcome Foundation, London, UK) was
dissolved in 16.7% acid alcohol in diluent. Busulphan
(50 mg kg-'; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) and two isomers of
dimethylbusulphan (meso-DMB and ±-DMB, 12mg kg-';
Paterson Institute of Cancer Research) were dissolved in
50% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) in PBS. The untreated
control mice were given either PBS or 50% DMSO/PBS
alone. Each treatment group consisted of 8-9 mice, with 3-4
allocated for the CAFC assay and five for bone marrow
transplant.
In a separate experiment on melphalan and IMS, the
recipient mice were maintained on the non-absorbable anti-
biotic neomycin sulphate (3.5 g 1-; E-Z-EM Rooster, Dor-
drecht, The Netherlands), administered in drinking water 7
days before and 14 days after treatment. It is estimated that
this dose and course of antibiotic treatment completely sup-
pressed the intestinal microflora at the time of treatment
(Van der Waaij & Berghuis-de Vries, 1974; Goris et al.,
1986a) and is capable of protecting mice from radiation-
induced gut lethality (Pearson & Phelps, 1981).
Determination of haemopoietic subset frequencies in vitro
(CAFC assay)
At 24 h after drug treatment femoral bone marrow cells were
harvested, pooled from groups of 3-4 mice and plated at
limiting dilutions on pre-established and irradiated (20 Gy)
bone marrow stromal cultures as previously described
(Ploemacher et al., 1989). These cultures allowed growth of
haemopoietic precursors under the stromal layer, giving the
appearance of cobblestones on phase-contrast microscopy.
The frequency of cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFCs)
was then determined at various times between 5 and 40 days
after overlay. This in vitro system provided an estimate of the
surviving fraction of CAFCs on different days, which corres-
pond to granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units
(CFU-GM) (CAFC day 5), CFU-S day 12 (CAFC day 10)
and the primitive stem cells with long-term repopulating
ability (CAFC day 30-40) (Ploemacher et al., 1989, 1991,
1993).
Bone marrow transplant and determination ofengraftment in
vivo (Gpi-I chimerism assay).
At 24 h after the drug treatments, allocated mice were trans-
planted i.v. with 10' nucleated bone marrow cells freshly
harvested from the tibia and femur of B6-Gpi-la donor mice.
The level of erythroid chimerism in blood samples obtained
at different intervals and of chimerism in bone marrow,
spleen and thymus at 36 weeks after transplant was deter-
mined from glucose phosphate isomerase (Gpi-J) elect-
rophoresis as previously described (Van Os et al., 1992).

Results
Toxicity,
Drug doses were first administered on the basis of the max-
imal tolerance levels in bone marrow reconstituted mice as
given in the literature (Floersheim & Ruszkiewicz, 1969;
Marsh, 1976). No adverse toxicities were seen in transplanted
mice pretreated with 200 mgkg-' CY, 100mg kg-' IMS and
12 mg kg-' meso- or ± -DMB. BCNU (40 mg kg')-treated
animals also appeared to be in good health throughout the
20 week assay period, but severe renal toxicity had developed
by 9 months as evidenced from excessive urine output,
elevated blood urea nitrogen (240% of control) and reduced
kidney weights (50% of control). Histological examination of
kidney tissue showed necrosis and loss of cortical tubular
epithelium. Within hours following 50 mg kg-' busulphan,
the mice became inactive, hypothermic and prone to convul-
sions, but by 1 day after treatment they appeared fully
recovered. A dose of 20 mg kg-' melphalan allowed survival
of mice to 1 day for bone marrow CAFC estimates, but this
dose proved to be lethal owing to gut damage at 4 days. The
melphalan dose was subsequently lowered to 1Omgkg',
which enabled eight of nine tranplant recipients (89%) to
survive for estimation of donor bone marrow engraftment.
Melphalan-treated animals also experienced loss of incisors
over the period of 2-3 months after treatment, and so
powdered food was supplied to avoid problems of malnutri-
tion. A similar problem has been noted previously in mice
following treatment with CY and radiation (Pearson &
Phelps, 1981; Down & Mauch, 1991).
Treatment with melphalan, CY, BCNU, IMS or 5-FU
The femoral content of CAFCs 5-40 days after overlay in
mice treated 24h earlier with melphalan, CY, BCNU and
IMS is shown in Figure la as a percentage of normal control

values. Also shown are previously published CAFC data on
5-FU (Down & Ploemacher, 1993). Melphalan and 5-FU
appeared to have similar effects and were the most toxic to
early-developing CAFC subsets (at 5-10 days), with less
than 10% survival. Nevertheless, these agents did not affect
later developing CAFCs, indicating relative sparing of
haemopoietic cells capable of maintained growth in vitro.
Lower toxicity (> 10% survival) was found for early-
developing CAFCs following treatment with CY, BCNU or
IMS.
Owing to early CAFC depletion in the drug recipients,
melphalan and 5-FU had similar effects in promoting an
early wave of donor chimerism during the first 10 weeks after
transplant (Figure lb). Recovery of host haemopoiesis after
10 weeks was lower in patients treated with melphalan, as
also reflected in the higher toxicity for primitive, late CAFCs
(Figure la). CY, BCNU and IMS induced low, moderate
and relatively high engraftment levels respectively up to 20
weeks post BMT (Figure lb). In this case BCNU and
especially IMS induced engraftment levels that are at
variance with the CAFC frequencies shown in Figure la.
Treatment with oral neom cin and melphalan or IMS
Figure 2 compares two separate experiments on the effects of
melphalan and IMS on mice maintained on oral neomycin in
order to alleviate the gastrointestinal toxic effects of mel-
phalan. As shown in Figure 2a, CAFC survival after mel-
phalan was much higher in antibiotic-treated recipients, and
this is consistent with the corresponding low levels of blood
cell chimersim after BMT, as shown in Figure 2b. The effects
of IMS on CAFC frequency (Figure 2a) or on donor marrow
engraftment (Figure 2b) did not appear to be influenced by
neomycin treatment.
The protective effect of intestinal decontamination by
neomycin was additionally demonstrated in an experiment in
which bone marrow CFU-S appearing on the spleen were
measured after 7 days in irradiated (9.5 Gy) secondary
recipients. In this case, melphalan without neomycin was able
to deplete more than two decades of CFU-S, whereas only
50% of CFU-S were killed in animals maintained on the
antibiotic (data not shown).
Treatment with busulphan or the isomers ofDMB
Figure 3a displays the percentage CAFC survival following
treatment with the dimethane sulphonate compounds busul-
phan and the DMB isomers. These agents proved to be
especially toxic to the primitive CAFC subsets that appeared
after 28 days, causing cell kill of more than two decades.
Both DMB derivatives appeared to be more toxic to CAFCs
developing before 28 days than the parent compound. In
contrast to the other alkylating agents studied, we also found
that the cobblestone cells remaining after busulphan, ±-
DMB or meso-DMB were qualitatively abnormal (diminish-
ed in number and size), as noted in a previous study on
busulphan (Down & Ploemacher, 1993).
The dimethane sulphonate compounds were found to be
effective BMT preparative agents for both early and late
donor engraftment (Figure 3b). In this case busulphan and
+DMB were similar, while the meso-DMB isomer was less
effective.

spleen and thymus
The different levels of late blood chimerism seen at 36 weeks
in the groups pretreated with melphalan, CY, BCNU, IMS,
busulphan and DMB were also reflected in engraftment
among other haemopoietic and lymphopoietic cells of the
bone marrow, spleen and thymus (Table I). No significant
changes in marrow, spleen and thymus cellularity or spleen
and thymus weight were observed in these animals at 36
weeks post BMT as compared with untreated controls (data
not shown). Peripheral erythrocyte and leucocyte counts were
also normal in treated mice.

The association between bone marrow stem cell heterogeneity
and chemosensitivity is a subject of continuing interest in
experimental and clinical haematology. It is often held that
the susceptibility of the bone marrow to most chemothera-
peutic drugs is related to the high proliferative activity of
certain haemopoietic cell populations. This is well recognised
for the cell cycle-specific effects of the antimetabolite 5-FU
against the committed and rapidly proliferating progenitor
cell populations that give rise to CFU-GM and early-
developing CFU-S (Hodgson & Bradley, 1979; Hodgson et
al., 1982). In a previous study (Down & Ploemacher, 1993)
we found that this effect corresponds to the marked depletion
of the early-developing and cycling CAFC subsets and the
early wave of donor erythroid chimerism. The resistance of
quiescent primitive stem cells relates in turn to complete
survival of late-developing CAFCs and subsequent return of
host-type haemopoiesis after BMT. In the present study on
alkylating agents, melphalan exhibited similar effects to 5-FU
on both early CAFC content and early engraftment to
denote a differential cell killing effect on proliferating cells.
The acute toxicity that we observed in other tissues of rapid
cell renewal, namely the intestinal epithelium and rodent
incisors, supports a general susceptibility of cycling cells
towards melphalan.
The data obtained from the protective effects of gut decon-
tamination by neomycin on CAFC and CFU-S kill by mel-
phalan provide interesting supplementary information that
may also be related to the cycling status of haemopoietic
cells. In this case, removal of intestinal aerobic Gram-
negative bacteria may indirectly inhibit haemopoietic cell
proliferation through reduction of endotoxin levels and thus
confer increased resistance to melphalan. This finding is con-
sistent with previous studies showing decreased kill by the
S-phase-specific drug hydroxyurea of bone marrow CFU-S
and CFU-GM in mice by administration of the antibiotic
polymyxin (Goris et al., 1985, 1986b). Since the microbial
composition of the intestinal microflora in mice is likely to
vary between different laboratories, associated variations in
bone marrow stem cell kinetics may hamper direct com-
parisons of cytostatic drug effects between groups of inves-
tigators.
The relatively small effects of CY and BCNU on CAFCs
at all times after overlay is at variance with published levels
of CFU-S depletion, more than one decade cell kill having
been commonly observed with these drug doses (Marsh,
1976). Our finding of greater than 10% CAFC survival fol-
lowing CY treatment was, however, a consistent finding in
three other experiments regardless of whether the bone mar-
row was assayed 6 or 24 h after CY treatment (data not
shown). In the present study, the relatively high CAFC sur-
vival levels are reflected by the low incidence of early and late
donor-type chimerism in CY-pretreated recipients.
In apparent contrast to the findings of our study, Massa et
al. (1987) found no donor-type cells in mice pretreated with
IMS. However, their study used a lower drug dose of 50 mg
kg-' and the 5 day delay to BMT may have rendered IMS
less effective in inducing stem cell engraftment. IMS and, to a
lesser extent, BCNU induced higher chimerism levels than
could be predicted from the magnitude of host CAFC deple-
tion. Such anomalies leave open the interesting possibility
that, apart from the eradication of stem cells in the bone
marrow at 24 h after treatment, other as yet unknown factors
can influence the engraftment of transplanted cells. An IMS-
induced stromal defect seems unlikely since this would
similarly affect outgrowth of both host and grafted stem
cells. Other factors could include a delayed stem cell deple-
tion effect after 24 h or a change in seeding efficiency of the
donor cells.
Busulphan is the drug most frequently chosen for treat-
ment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia and has also been
increasingly used in recent years as an alternative to total
body irradiation in preparative regimens for BMT (Bortin et
al., 1992b; Copelan & Deeg, 1992). Of particular interest to
the present study is the characteristic toxicity of DMB and
the parent busulphan compound against the primitive and
quiescent stem cell population, as clearly shown by severe
depletion of the late CAFC subset. This concords with pro-
vision for long-term donor bone marrow engraftment as
previously documented in mice (Massa et al., 1987; Mauch et
al., 1988; Lapidot et al., 1989; Leong et al., 1992), rats
(Santos & Tutschka, 1974) and humans (Fishleder et al.,
1992). Indeed, the low survival of late CAFCs and high levels
of long-term engraftment following treatment with busulphan
and ±DMB in the present study are similar to total body
irradiation given at a dose of between 6 and 7 Gy (Down &
Ploemacher, 1993). The diminished quality as well as the
quantity of bone marrow CAFCs that we observed after
treatment with busulphan and the DMB isomers may cer-
tainly confer an additional growth advantage on donor cells
as compared with host stem cells in vivo. Such an effect can
presumably dissociate CAFC frequency from chimerism and
may explain the subtle differences in engraftment levels
between the two DMB isomers. Further experiments are
under way to explore more directly the issue of stem cell
quality (as determined by clonal expansion in long-term
stroma-supported bone marrow cultures) versus quantity
(absolute frequencies as measured in the CAFC assay) in
relation to engraftment of donor bone marrow.
While busulphan has been in routine clinical use since the
1950s, relatively little is known of the actual target molecules
with which it reacts to inactivate a given cell. The chemical
structure of dimethane sulphonates allows for more restricted
spacing of the two reactive groups as compared with the
other bifunctional alkylating chemotherapeutic agents used in
this study, i.e. melphalan, CY and BCNU. Investigations on
different analogues of busulphan have shown a remarkable
range of biological activities among various cell renewal tis-
sue systems (Berenbaum et al., 1%7; Fox & Fox, 1967; Dunn
& Elson, 1970; Fox, 1975). These diverse cytotoxic effects
have been shown to be related to the distance and orientation
of the two alkylating groups, which in turn provides inform-
ation on the structure and function of critical target (recep-
tor) molecules (Bedford & Fox, 1983; Hartley & Fox, 1986;
Fox et al., 1991; Hadfield et al., 1992). Such considerations
may be appLied in the search for new compounds that have
the ability to selectively deplete late-developing CAFCs
ALKYLATING DRUGS IN BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION 615
(representing resting primitive stem cells) for use in improved
BMT conditioning therapy. The recent development of an
equivalent CAFC assay system for human marrow (Breems
et al., 1994) may prove valuable in bringing this type of
treatment closer to a clinical realisation.
We wish to thank Dr John Hadfield for the chemical analvsis of the

Kreiger is greatly appreciated. This study was partly supported by a
