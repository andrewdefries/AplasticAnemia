Abstract
We report an unusual sequence of clinico-pathological manifestations of myelodysplastic syndrome
and thymic squamous cell carcinoma. A 77-year-old man with a two-month history of
myelodysplastic syndrome was admitted with acute chest pain and shortness of breath. Radiological
investigations revealed an anterior mediastinal mass, associated with mediastinal haemorrhage. The
mass was excised via a standard median sternotomy and was found to be an infiltrating squamous cell
carcinoma, which arose from a multilocular thymic cyst.
Introduction
Spontaneous mediastinal haemorrhage is rare, usually
presenting with chest pain and dyspnoea. In this paper, we
describe a patient who developed haemorrhage into a
multilocular thymic cyst, which showed focal develop-
ment of squamous cell carcinoma. This thymic lesion was
associated with a form of myelodysplasia (Refractory
anaemia with excess blasts-1: RAEB-1), progressing to
myeloid sarcoma. It ultimately proved fatal.
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of clonal
haematopoietic stem cell disorders characterised by
marrow dysplasia and ineffective haematopoiesis in one
or more of the myeloid lines, resulting in low blood cell
counts [1]. The median age at diagnosis of MDS is
70 years, and the condition is more prevalent in males.
RAEB-1 is a form of MDS in which there are 5-9%
myeloblasts in the bone marrow or 2-4% blasts in the
peripheral blood. It is characterised by progressive
anaemia and a tendency to develop acute myeloid
leukaemia in 25-33% of cases; the rest of the patients die
of the consequences of marrow failure [1]. Overall survival
is about 9-16 months. Although most patients with MDS
have no obvious cause for their disease, there are well-
established risk factors, including: smoking; ionising
radiation; and chemotherapy for other malignancies.
Myeloid sarcoma is a tumour mass of myeloblasts or
immature myeloid cells occurring in an extramedullary
site or in bone [1]. It is associated with acute myeloid
leukaemia or, in the case of MDS, it may be the first
manifestation of blastic transformation.

Case presentation
A 77-year-old white Caucasian man was admitted with a
three-day history of chest pain, dyspnoea, sweating and
haemoptysis. He was already under haematological
review, having been diagnosed with MDS (RAEB-1). A
bone marrow aspirate was hypercellular. It showed
erythroid hyperplasia with prominent non-megaloblastic
dyserythropoiesis, active left-shifted granulopoiesis with
marked dysgranulopoiesis, and some diminutive mega-
karyocytes. No ring sideroblasts were seen. Myeloid blast
cells were 9%, and no Auer rods were seen. The myeloid:
erythroid cell ratio was 0.8:1. Lymphocytes were reduced
in number, and there were fewer than 10% plasma cells.
Cytogenetics studies showed trisomy 8, in keeping with
MDS. No other clonal chromosome abnormalities were
detected. He had started blood and platelet transfusions
6 weeks prior to this acute admission.
Examination on admission showed mild sinus tachycardia
(pulse rate = 91/min) and hypotension (100/70 mmHg),
the jugular venous pressure was not raised and ausculta-
tion of the heart was normal. The trachea was in the
midline and the respiratory rate was 22/min. Auscultation
of the lungs revealed basal crepitations and reduced air
entry at the right base.
Haematological investigations showed a haemoglobin of
9.1 g/dL and thrombocytopenia (22 × 109
/L; N = 150-
400 × 109
/L), with a normal leukocyte count (5.3 × 109
/L;
N = 4.0-11.0 × 109
/L). The prothrombin and activated
partial thromboplastin times were within normal limits.
Basic biochemical tests, including urea and electrolytes,
liver function tests and cardiac enzymes, showed no
significant abnormality.
Chest X-ray showed a widened mediastinum. Computed
tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) revealed a
mass of soft tissue density in the anterior mediastinum,
associated with mediastinal haemorrhage and bilateral
small pleural effusions. The CTPA also confirmed a
previously noted infra-renal aortic aneurysm. A magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the chest located the
mediastinal mass in relation to, but outside, the pericar-
dium (Figure). There were foci of high signal suggestive of
haemorrhage but also some low signal components on T1
and T2, suggesting the possibility of fibrous tissue.
The patient underwent total thymectomy via standard
median sternotomy, once he was haemodynamically
stable following platelet transfusion. At operation, the
anterior mediastinal mass (measuring 10 × 7 × 3 cm) was
stuck to pericardium anterolaterally on right and to the
upper and middle lobes of the right lung. There were
700 ml of haemorrhagic fluid in the right pleural cavity.
The thymus was resected with the anterior part of
pericardium, wedge excisions of right upper and middle
lobes and excision of right phrenic nerve and lymph
nodes. His post-operative course was uneventful apart
from developing a superficial sternal wound infection,
which was treated with antibiotics.
Histopathological examination of the mediastinal mass
revealed an infiltrating squamous carcinoma, which
appeared to have arisen from a multilocular thymic cyst.
The cysts, which were generally lined by an attenuated
epithelium, but focally by well-differentiated squamous
epithelium, were filled with blood clot showing focal
organisation at the periphery. Adjacent thymic tissue
showed haemorrhagic infarction, which appeared to be
secondary to thrombosis of small vessels, at least one of
which was an artery with a necrotic wall surrounded by a
rim of squamous cell carcinoma. In the background was
widespread focal proliferation of immature haematopoie-
tic cells, predominantly myeloblasts and myelocytes. Three
small lymph nodes were found within the tissue. All of
them showed permeation of sinusoids by large malignant
cells in keeping with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma
and extramedullary haematopoietic activity similar to that
seen in the thymic tissue. Cytological examination of the
pleural fluid was negative for neoplasia.
He was followed up in thoracic surgical, haematological
and oncological outpatient clinics, receiving supportive
blood and platelet transfusion at regular intervals.
Adjuvant radiotherapy was not offered in view of his
MDS and other co-morbidities, including the large infra-
renal aortic aneurysm. He was also seen by a vascular
surgeon during this period, but the risks of aneurysmal
repair were considered to outweigh the benefits.

Fourteen months after the initial surgery, he presented
with a 12 × 7 × 3 mm dark red/brown soft tumour at the
site of the sternal wound. It was excised under general
anaesthesia and the histology was reported as myeloid
sarcoma, which, given the preponderance of blasts, was
regarded as a blastic variant of granulocytic sarcoma.
Single fraction radiotherapy was given to the tumour site
4 weeks following excision.
Two months later, his general physical condition deterio-
rated and he was admitted for terminal palliative care,
dying one day later.
Discussion
Various paraneoplastic syndromes, myasthenia gravis
being the commonest, have been described in association
with thymic tumours [2]. There are a variety of other
associations including: haematological abnormalities (e.g.
pure red cell aplasia), malignancy (e.g. acute leukaemia)
and other non-malignant manifestations, such as hypo-
gammaglobulinaemia (Good’s syndrome) [3]. According
to Montresor and colleagues, 21% of patients that
presented with thymoma were discovered to have other
tumours [4].
Our case is unusual in two respects. One is its presentation
with acute mediastinal and pleural haemorrhage. Pre-
sentation of thymic masses by mediastinal haemorrhage is
most unusual, with few reports in the literature [5-7]. The
bleeding into the tumour may have been triggered by
arterial wall necrosis and thrombosis, compounded by the
underlying haematological abnormality. The other, we
believe, unique, aspect of our case is the association of
thymic squamous cell carcinoma (arising from a multi-
locular thymic cyst) and MDS, which later progressed to
myeloid sarcoma. Although thymic carcinoma and MDS
are different clinical entities, it is legitimate to consider
whether MDS might represent another form of thymic
tumour-associated paraneoplastic state. Given the list of
haematological associations noted above, it is a possibi-
lity, admittedly rare. If so, the underlying mechanisms
remain to be elucidated.
