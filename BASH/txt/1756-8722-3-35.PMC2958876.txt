Autoimmune conditions and hairy cell leukemia:
an exploratory case-control study

, Eric A Engels2
Abstract
Background: Case reports suggest that hairy cell leukemia (HCL) may be associated with autoimmune conditions,
however no systematic investigations in this area have been undertaken.
Methods: Using the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare linked database, we
conducted an exploratory study comparing autoimmune conditions in 418 HCL cases (aged ≥65 years) and
160,086 controls.
Results: Overall, the proportion with autoimmune conditions was similar between HCL cases and controls (n = 79
(18.9%) and n = 29,284 (18.3%), respectively). Before diagnosis/selection, there was no overall difference in the
prevalence of autoimmune conditions in HCL cases (n = 37, 8.9%) compared with controls (n = 14,085, 8.8%), p =
0.969. However, compared with controls, HCL cases more frequently had sarcoidosis (OR 9.6, 95%CI 2.4-39.5),
Sjögren syndrome (OR 6.1, 95%CI 2.0-19.3) and erythema nodosum (OR 37, 95%CI 4.9-284) before diagnosis.
Autoimmune conditions were also more common in HCL cases than controls around the time of diagnosis/
selection (p < 0.001) but not subsequently.
Conclusions: The findings do not support an overall relationship between autoimmune conditions and HCL,
although the association with some autoimmune conditions prior to HCL diagnosis may warrant further
investigation. Our findings also suggest that autoimmune conditions in HCL patients may be detected around the
time of diagnosis.
Introduction
Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare, indolent, B-cell neo-
plasm, accounting for approximately 2% of all non-
Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in the U.S. [1]. Organic
solvents and some medical conditions including anemia
could be related to development of HCL [2]. Factors
affecting the immune system, including autoimmune
conditions, are associated with an elevated risk of sev-
eral other NHL subtypes [3]. Case reports have
described the occurrence of autoimmune conditions
antecedent to and following diagnosis or treatment of
HCL [4-8], suggesting that autoimmune conditions may
be associated with this malignancy.
Nonetheless, no prior study has systematically assessed
associations between a range of autoimmune conditions
and HCL. We therefore conducted an exploratory study
using linked U.S. data from the Surveillance, Epidemiol-
ogy, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry program
and Medicare to investigate the relation between a
range of autoimmune conditions and HCL, separately
examining the periods before, at, and after HCL
diagnosis.
Methods
The SEER-Medicare Assessment of Hematopoietic
Malignancy Risk Traits (SMAHRT) Study is a popula-
tion-based study of hematopoietic malignancies in elderly
adults, using SEER-Medicare linked data [9]. The SEER
program (1973-2002) includes data on cancer cases cov-
ering approximately 25% of the U.S. population for the
most recent years. Medicare provides federally funded
health insurance for approximately 97% of persons aged
≥65 years in the U.S. All Medicare beneficiaries have Part
A coverage for hospital inpatient care, and approximately
96% subscribe to Part B coverage for physician and

includes Medicare enrollment and claims data (1986-
2002) for SEER cancer cases diagnosed through Decem-
ber 2002, and for a 5% random sample of Medicare bene-
ficiaries residing in SEER registry areas [10].
The SMAHRT Study includes as cases individuals from
the SEER-Medicare database with a hematopoietic malig-
nancy. Cases were aged 67-99 years at diagnosis, with at
least 12 months of prior Part A and Part B coverage and
without enrollment in a health maintenance organization
to ensure adequate accrual of information on medical
conditions prior to malignancy diagnosis. For the present
analyses, we included cases with HCL (International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology Version 3, code
9940) diagnosed between 1987 and 2002.
The SMAHRT Study includes two controls per hema-
topoietic malignancy case (n = 83,113), selected from
the 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Con-
trols were frequency matched to all hematopoietic
malignancy cases by calendar year of diagnosis, age in
five categories (67-69, 70-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85-99 years)
and gender. Cases and controls with a prior diagnosis of
human immunodeficiency virus infection were excluded.
All SMAHRT Study controls were utilized in the pre-
sent analysis (n = 160,086).
Using Medicare data, we searched for claims for speci-
fic autoimmune conditions. Subjects were classified as
having an autoimmune condition if they had ≥1 hospital
claim, or ≥2 physician or outpatient claims for the con-
dition at least 30 days apart. Autoimmune conditions
with a prevalence of ≥0.1% in control subjects were
included in the study. Autoimmune conditions were
categorized as being before, at, or after “diagnosis/selec-
tion” according to whether the above definition was first
met in the period >12 months before, from 12 months
before until 12 months after, or >12 months after HCL
diagnosis (in cases) or selection (in controls).
Chi-square tests were used to compare the overall
proportion of cases and controls with autoimmune con-
ditions. Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs
comparing the prevalence of autoimmune conditions
before diagnosis/selection in cases and controls. Ana-
lyses were adjusted for the matching factors and race
(white, non-white). Additional analyses were restricted
to whites only or to females only. Proportional hazards
regression, adjusting for matching factors, was used to
compare the time to diagnosis of autoimmune condi-
tions after HCL diagnosis/control selection with patients
censored at the date of death or end of study date
(December 31, 2002), whichever occurred earlier.
Results
The study included 418 HCL cases (Table 1). Compared
with controls (n = 160,086), HCL cases were more likely
to be male, younger, and white. Duration of Medicare
coverage and the number of prior physician and outpati-
ent claims were similar for cases and controls. Controls
tended to have more hospital claims than HCL cases.
Overall, 79 (18.9%) HCL cases and 29,284 (18.3%)
controls had at least one of the autoimmune conditions
presented in Table 2, p = 0.749. During the period
before diagnosis/selection, there was no overall differ-
ence in the prevalence of autoimmune conditions in
HCL cases (n = 37, 8.9%) compared with controls (n =
14,085, 8.8%), p = 0.969. Nonetheless, among specific
autoimmune conditions, sarcoidosis (OR 9.6, p = 0.002),
Sjögren syndrome (OR 6.1, p = 0.002), and erythema
nodosum (OR 37, p < 0.001) were more common in
cases than controls, despite small numbers (Table 2).
Most cases were diagnosed with the respective autoim-
mune condition in the 1-5 year period before diagnosis.
When we restricted our analyses to whites only or
females only the point estimates were similar (data not
shown).
In the period after diagnosis/selection, no autoimmune
conditions occurred more frequently in HCL cases com-
pared to controls, Table 2. Overall, 23 (5.5%) HCL cases
and 11,993 (7.5%) controls had at least one autoimmune
condition in this period, p = 0.122.
Autoimmune conditions were more common in HCL
patients (n = 26, 6.2%) at the time of diagnosis than
controls (n = 5,146, 3.2%), p < 0.001. Of the autoim-
mune conditions, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn disease,
Hashimoto thyroditis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
pernicious anemia, and Sjögren syndrome were more
commonly reported in cases than controls during this
time period, Table 2.
Discussion
This exploratory case-control study of 418 HCL cases is
the first to examine associations with a diverse range of
autoimmune conditions. The rarity of this NHL subtype
presents a challenge for systematic epidemiologic study,
and prior reports have mostly consisted of small case
series or case reports. Although our study included
more HCL cases than previous studies, most autoim-
mune conditions are also uncommon. Thus, the associa-
tions reported were based on few cases, which led to
imprecise estimates.
Although we found no overall difference in the pro-
portion of cases and controls with an autoimmune con-
dition, there was some evidence for an excess of
sarcoidosis, erythema nodosum and Sjögren syndrome
occurring antecedent to HCL diagnosis. Overlap
between these three conditions has previously been
reported [11] and erythema nodosum [8,12] and sarcoi-
dosis [8] have been reported in HCL patients. Sjögren
syndrome and several other autoimmune conditions are

associated with an increased risk of developing other
NHL subtypes [3], which might be explained by anti-
gen-driven chronic inflammation [13]. In addition, non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been associated
with a three-fold increased risk of HCL [2]. While use
of immunosuppressive medications to treat some auto-
immune conditions has been linked to lymphoma, a
recent study has suggested that the severity of the con-
dition, not its treatment, is responsible for the added
risk [14]. If certain autoimmune conditions do increase
the risk of HCL, it may therefore be due to the autoim-
mune disease itself rather than its treatment. Most cases
with these autoimmune conditions were diagnosed in
the 1-5 year period prior to diagnosis suggesting the
possibility that some of these conditions may be part of
the early disease process of HCL. However, there were
too few cases for us to reliably evaluate the time from
first claim for the autoimmune condition until HCL
diagnosis, which would have shed additional light.
In contrast to these restricted associations, we found a
much broader range of associations between HCL and
various autoimmune conditions at the time of diagnosis.
This observation could have several explanations: caus-
ality in either direction (i.e., the autoimmune condition
or its treatment leading to HCL, or HCL or its treat-
ment leading to the autoimmune condition), the pre-
sence of a common underlying risk factor for both the
autoimmune condition and HCL, or over diagnosis in
HCL patients undergoing medical evaluation for HCL-
related symptoms which would result in detection bias.
Arguing against this last possibility, however, we note
that the prevalence of non-immune-related medical con-
ditions (including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, peptic
ulcer disease, migraine, depression, and gastroesophageal
reflux) were not significantly higher in HCL patients
compared to controls at the time of diagnosis/selection
(data not shown).
Limitations and strengths of our study should be con-
sidered. We relied upon Medicare claims to determine
the presence of autoimmune conditions. To reduce the

as having an autoimmune condition if they had a hospi-
tal diagnosis, or at least two physician or outpatient
claims at least 30 days apart. In addition, our study was
limited to HCL cases aged >65 years, which comprise
only 37.8% of U.S. cases [15]. Our results may not be
generalizable to younger HCL cases. Furthermore, as
noted above, the associations with sarcoidosis, Sjögren
syndrome, and erythema nodosum although strong
(ORs 9.6, 6.1 and 37, respectively) were based on few
affected HCL cases and may have occurred by chance.
Given the rarity of HCL, our study is the largest to date.
Our study has several additional strengths, including
population-based sampling of HCL cases, a large num-
ber of controls representative of the Medicare popula-
tion, and availability of Medicare claims files, enabling

conditions.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our study found little difference in the
occurrence of autoimmune conditions between HCL
cases and controls except at the time around HCL diag-
nosis. Despite small numbers of affected individuals, sar-
coidosis, Sjögren syndrome and erythema nodosum were
associated with an increased risk of subsequent HCL.
Chance, chronic immune stimulation or medication
used in the treatment of these autoimmune conditions
may explain the findings. Further investigation of these
exploratory findings may be warranted.
