An expanded cohort study of 74,828 benzene-exposed and 35,805 unexposed workers were
followed during 1972 to 1987, based on a previous study in 12 cities in China. A small increase
was observed in total cancer mortality among benzene-exposed compared with unexposed
workers (relative risk [RR]= 1.2). Statistically significant excesses were noted for leukemia
(RR=2.3), malignant lymphoma (RR=4.5), and lung cancer (RR= 1.4). When risks were
evaluated by leukemia subtype, only acute myelogenous leukemia was significantly elevated
(RR = 3.1), although nonsignificant excesses were also noted for chronic myelogenous leukemia
(RR=2.6) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (RR=2.3). A significant excess was also found for
aplastic anemia. Environ Health Perspect 104(Suppl 6):1339-1341 (1996)

Introduction
Benzene has been widely used in chemical
manufacturing and other industries for
about a century. A nationwide survey
carried out in 1979 to 1981 revealed that
529,000 workers were occupationally
exposed to benzene or benzene-containing
mixtures in China (1). Similarly, it has
been estimated that 233,000 people are
occupationally exposed to benzene in
petrochemical plants, petroleum refineries,
and other operations in the United States
(2). In addition to occupational exposures,
benzene concentrations varying from
1 to 150 mg/m3 have been described in
urban and densely trafficked areas (3).
Therefore, benzene is a potentially important

carcinogen not only to workers, but also
to the general population (4).
The present study was initiated as a
collaboration between the Institute of
Occupational Medicine, China, and the
U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI),
based on an earlier retrospective cohort
study carried out by Chinese investigators
among 28,480 benzene-exposed and 28,257
unexposed workers followed up from 1972
to 1981 in China (5). The major reasons
for expanding upon the original cohort
study were to include substantially more
subjects, additional person-years of follow-
up, and more leukemia cases, for analyzing
in detail the relationship of benzene with
subtype ofleukemia and other hematolym-
phoproliferative malignancies. In this paper
we summarize the mortality risks for all
cancers and the incidence risks for all
leukemia and other selected hematolym-
phoproliferative malignant and nonmalig-
nant disorders (HLD). Further detail is
provided in Yin et al. (6).
Methods
Study Population and Data Sources
The methods for this expanded study are
described in detail elsewhere (7). Briefly,
the study subjects were selected from
workers employed in 672 factories in
which benzene was used (exposed factories)
compared to unexposed workers at 69 of
these factories and at 40 additional facto-
ries (unexposed factories) in 12 cities in
China (including Shanghai, Tianjin,
Chengdu, Chongqing, Harbin, Shenyang,
Jinzhou, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Guangzho,
Nanchang, Kaifeng) in China. Using
monthly salary records, field center staff in
each city identified all workers employed
for any length of time in the eligible work
units or factories during 1972 to 1987. If
salary records were not available or incom-
plete for the eligible work units or factories
during the study period, other data sources
used in a standardized hierarchial approach
included job registers (completed upon ini-
tiation of employment at a factory), health
examination forms, and hazardous work
compensation registries.
Data Coliection and Foliow-up
Procedures
For each eligible study subject, data
abstracted included the worker's name,
birthdate, sex, job history in study factories,
vital status on December 31, 1987, date
last known alive iflost to follow up, cause(s)
of death and date of death for deceased
workers, history and date of diagnosis of
leukemia or other HLD, and history and
date ofdiagnosis ofbenzene poisoning.
Workers who left study factories before
December 31, 1987, were followed up and
traced to determine vital status, cause of
death, and occurrence of leukemia and
other HLD. For deceased subjects, cause of
death was obtained from medical records,
other written factory records, or death
certificates at local police stations. The sub-
ject's physician or the next of kin was con-
tacted only if written records listing cause
of death could not be obtained. For all
subjects whose cause of death was sus-
pected to be cancer or HLD, hospital and
other medical records were sought to verify
the diagnosis. The specific histopathology,
date of diagnosis, date of death, hospital/
place of death, source of medical informa-
tion, and other important diagnosis-related
information were abstracted on a standard
diagnostic validation form and reviewed by
the field center director and the investiga-
tors. For cases of HLD, medical records
and all available pathology and peripheral
blood smear slides were reviewed by
hematopathologists from the Beijing Union
Medical College Hospital, the NCI, and
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

The exposure assessment methods used
to determine time period-specific quantita-
tive estimates of benzene exposure by job
title within work units are described else-
where (8). For the statistical analysis, rela-
tive risks (RR) were derived as the ratio of
age- and sex-adjusted rates in the exposed
and unexposed groups.
Results
The expanded cohort consisted of 74,828
exposed and 35,805 unexposed persons in
781 factories and 12 cities (Table 1). They
were followed up for an average of 10.5
and 11.7 years, respectively. Approximately
1.8% of exposed and 1.7% of unexposed
workers were deceased, and 0.2% of
exposed and 0.3% of unexposed workers
were lost to follow-up (Table 2).
There were 1369 deceased in the
exposed cohort and 598 deceased in the
unexposed cohort.
Age-adjusted RR for cancer mortality
for the exposed compared with the unex-
posed groups are shown in Table 3. The
RR ranged from 0.4 to 2.8 for women and
from 0.9 to 3.3 for men. RR for leukemia
was 2.8 for women and 2.1 for men. RR
for lung cancer was 1.5 for men and 1.0
for women.
Incidence risks for HLD were analyzed
using the internal comparison to assess the
difference between exposed and unexposed
workers. Table 4 presents RR for the
specific HLD. HLD, including leukemia,
myelodysplastic syndromes, and lym-
phoma, were significantly elevated, with
RR ranging from 2.5 to 3.1. The observed
number of aplastic anemia and agranulocy-
tosis cases were nine and two, respectively,
in exposed workers, but there were no cases
in unexposed workers.
Discussion
There have been several reports describing
risks of leukemia, lymphoma, and other
cancers in relation to occupational benzene
exposure in several countries (9-17). Most
of the studies have reported mortality
excesses for all hematopoietic and lym-
phatic cancers. However, most of the
investigations yielded small numbers in the

cohorts studied and few leukemia cases.
While a few cohort studies evaluated more
than 10,000 workers in rubber factories or
oil companies, the findings were not
significantly elevated for leukemia. Most of
the studies usually compared the study
population with the general population;
few used an internal comparison cohort.
This study was designed specifically to
avoid the disadvantage of earlier investiga-
tions (18). To date, this study is the largest
cohort mortality investigation, comprising
81 cases and 13 cases of HLD observed
in exposed and unexposed groups, respec-
tively. The distribution by sex, age, and
calendar-year at first entry were similar for
exposed and unexposed groups. Such an
internal comparison group makes it possi-
ble to minimize the healthy worker effect.

examination of information. It will be
important to continue to follow these
workers, since substantial numbers, particu-
larly those first employed after 1980, will
only have experienced low exposure levels
ofbenzene since start ofemployment.
The risk was significantly increased for
the combined grouping of acute myelo-
genous leukemia and myelodysplastic
syndromes, since the latter may precede
overt leukemia. Risk was also increased for
chromic myelogenous leukemia and acute
lymphocytic leukemia, but not statistically
significant. Risk was significantly increased
for malignant lymphoma and for non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma, but not for multiple
myeloma. Mortality from lung cancer was
significantly increased due to a significant
excess among males, consistent with the
results from a previous study in China.
Based on analysis of the incidence in
the largest cohort, it was confirmed that
benzene is a leukemogen, especially for
myelogenous leukemia in humans, and
benzene is possibly also associated with
excess risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
and lung cancer among humans.
