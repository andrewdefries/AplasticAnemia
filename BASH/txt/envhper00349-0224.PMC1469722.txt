Previous occupational cohort studies of benzene-exposed workers have for the most part used
only death certificates to validate diagnoses of workers developing leukemia and other
hematopoietic and lymphoproliferative malignancies and related disorders (HLD). In a follow-up
study of 74,828 benzene-exposed workers and a comparison group of 35,805 nonexposed
workers from 12 cities in China, we sought to characterize clinicopathologically and to confirm
diagnoses of all cases of HLD. Using medical records, laboratory hematology results, and
histopathology, U.S. and Chinese expert hematopathologists, blinded to exposure status, carried
out a detailed review using standardized evaluation forms. Key among the findings were a
notable diversity of malignant and nonneoplastic hematopoietic and lymphoproliferative
disorders, documentation of excess myelodysplastic syndromes among benzene workers, and
widespread dyspoiesis involving all hematopoietic cell lines. As sophisticated clinicopathologic
characterization and corresponding classification schemes for HLD become increasingly
widespread, it is recommended that future epidemiologic investigations of benzene workers
incorporate similarly detailed morphologic evaluation. In extending follow-up of this cohort of
young workers, we will continue to use all available clinical, laboratory hematology, and pathology
data as well as cytogenetic and biochemical markers to characterize various HLD outcomes.
These careful surveillance mechanisms should also provide additional insight into carcinogenic
mechanisms of benzene and allow comparison of the molecular pathogenesis of HLD induced by
benzene versus chemotherapy, radiation, or other exposure. - Environ Health Perspect

Introduction
Benzene, a ubiquitous constituent of
cigarette smoke, industrial solvents, auto-
mobile emissions, and a broad variety of
other products, (1) is widely recognized to
be etiologically linked with acute myeloid
leukemia (2). Other hematopoietic and
lymphoproliferative malignant and related
disorders (HLD) associated with benzene
exposure include aplastic anemia (3,4) and
possibly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (5),
chronic myeloid leukemia (6), multiple
myeloma (7-9), chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (10), and various myelodysplastic
syndromes (11,12). To evaluate further the
quantitative relationship of acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) with benzene exposure
and to determine whether other types of
HLD were linked with this chemical, the
U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) and
the Chinese Academy of Preventive
Medicine (CAPM) collaborated in a large
cohort study of benzene-exposed workers
in China (13,14).
Clinicopathologic features of benzene-
exposed workers developing acute myeloid
leukemia (15-17), pancytopenia, and
aplastic anemia (3) have been previously
described in case series. Ascertainment of
HLD among benzene workers in defined
occupational cohorts, however, has been
largely based on death certificates (18,19)
in which information typically is limited
only to overall diagnosis(es), often without
specification of subtype (20). Therefore, a
major objective of the collaborative NCI-
CAPM cohort investigation was to obtain
detailed clinical diagnostic information
from all available medical record and labo-
ratory sources to describe incident HLD
cases (21).
In an earlier report (22), we included
descriptions of salient clinicopathologic
features of HLD cases for which bone mar-
row, lymph node or related tumor tissue,
peripheral blood smears, and pathology
and laboratory hematology reports were
available. The goal of the present paper is
to provide a comprehensive overview ofthe
sources and types of information available
for all patients and to describe clinical
features. In addition to individual case
descriptions (22), we also present summary
statistics for selected HLD subtypes.
Methods
A detailed description of the methods for
identifying and following up subjects using
written factory records can be found in

earlier reports (13,21). The study popula-
tion includes 74,828 benzene-exposed
workers and a comparison group of 35,805
nonexposed workers, with 60% of the total
person-years (P-Y) contributed by workers
less than 30 years of age at study entry, and
47% of the exposed and 40% of the nonex-
posed P-Y contributed by women (13,21).
For deceased subjects and all incident cases
suspected as having HLD, cause of death or
diagnostic information, respectively, was
first sought from medical records, then
other factory records or death certificates,
followed only if necessary by contacts with
treating physicians and next ofkin.
For all exposed and nonexposed HLD
cases, medical records from diagnostic and
subsequent visits, hematology and histo-
pathology reports, and peripheral blood
smears, bone marrow, lymph node, and all
other tumor tissue pathology slides were
sought. Information from all sources was
abstracted onto standardized forms by
physician investigators blinded to benzene
exposure status of the patients. Abstracted
data included the date and medical record
diagnosis of the hematopoietic disorder;
peripheral blood counts prior to therapy
(including hemoglobin, hematocrit, total
white blood count, a white blood cell
differential count, platelet count, reticulo-
cyte count, and date the specimen was
obtained); peripheral blood morphology;
diagnostic report of bone marrow aspirate
and/or biopsy, lymph node or other lym-
phoproliferative tumor tissue and results of
immunohistochemical stains; selected
physical examination findings (including
lymph node palpation, liver and spleen
evaluation, and other pertinent abnormali-
ties); diagnostic X-ray interpretation (chest
and abdominal radiographs and other per-
tinent evaluations); surgical reports at the
time of diagnostic evaluation; and stage
and classification scheme used to evaluate
extent of lymphoproliferative disorder.
Although we searched for other laboratory
data (including leukocyte alkaline phos-
phatase score, cytogenetic studies, serum
and urine lysozyme, lactose dehydrogenase,
and bilirubin), these data were rarely avail-
able in the medical records during the
study period.
All abstracted forms, medical records,
and available hematopathologic laboratory
slides were reviewed systematically by
expert U.S. and Chinese hematopathol-
ogists, from Mayo Clinic, NCI, and the
Division of Hematology of the Peking
Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing
University School of Medicine, who were

Most reviewers were fluent in reading
Chinese, the language in which the original
records were written. Details ofthe hemato-
logic evaluation have been described (22).
Diagnoses were assigned after evaluation of
all available clinical, laboratory, and patho-
logic data. Published criteria were used to
classify acute myeloid (also called nonlym-
phocytic) leukemia (23-25), acute lym-
phoblastic leukemia (23), chronic myeloid
leukemia (26), myelodysplastic syndromes
(27), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (28).
To summarize presenting symptoms
and signs of disease and peripheral blood
counts within HLD groups, we performed
univariate analyses (calculating medians,
means, standard deviations, etc.). We evalu-
ated the distribution of survival times after
diagnosis with product limit estimates (29).
Survival was also examined according to age
and exposure status, and tests of signifi-
cance were performed using log-rank (30).
Results
A total of 81 HLD were diagnosed among
benzene-exposed workers and 13 among
nonexposed workers during 1972 to 1987.
Twenty-nine (36%) of the 81 exposed
cases and 3 (23%) of the 13 nonexposed
cases were women. Median age at diagnosis
for all cases was 40 years for exposed and
48 for nonexposed. As shown in Table 1,
categories of specific disease types with the
largest numbers among the Chinese
benzene workers were AML and non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma, followed by aplastic
anemia, chronic myeloid leukemia and
myelodysplastic syndromes, and then acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. It is noteworthy
that tumors derived from B-lymphocytes
were quite rare. Confirmation of approxi-
mately 80% of all HLD cases among both
exposed and nonexposed workers was based
on review of either tissue specimens or cor-
responding hematopathology reports.
Eighty-eight percent of diagnoses were con-
firmed by evaluation ofmedical record data
or hematopathology specimens/reports
(Table 1).
Presenting symptoms abstracted from
medical records of benzene-exposed patients
with selected HLD are listed in Table 2, but
small numbers limit comparisons with non-
exposed cases, except for AML. For both the
exposed and nonexposed patients with AML
(data for latter not shown), the most com-
mon initial complaints were abnormal
bleeding (including petechiae, purpura, or
hemorrhage) and persistent fevers. These
symptoms are similar to those associated
with c/e novo AML (31).
Peripheral blood cell counts at diagno-
sis are shown for exposed patients with six
types of HLD and for nonexposed cases
with acute myeloid leukemia and non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma in Figures 1 through
4. For most HLD diagrammed in Figures
1 and 2, median hemoglobin concentra-
tions and platelet counts were low at diag-
nosis, as expected. Consistent patterns were
more difficult to identify for total white
blood cell and absolute lymphocyte counts
(Figures 3 and 4). For AML, median total

white blood cell counts (10,000 versus
25,000 x 103/pl) and absolute lymphocyte
count (1300 versus 4000 x 103/pl) were
notably lower for benzene-exposed patients
than for nonexposed cases (Figure 3).
However, the median total white blood
counts ofbenzene-exposed workers develop-
ing most other HLD conditions did not
appear to differ from those described for
most idiopathic cases reported in the litera-
ture (31). Benzene exposure appeared to
exert a variable effect on absolute lympho-
cyte counts, which were low for acute and
chronic myeloid leukemia cases but within
the normal range for aplastic anemia,
myelodysplastic syndromes and non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (Figure 4).
Among subjects with available pathology
material or records, morphologic features in
the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow of
benzene-exposed workers with AML com-
monly included anemia, thrombocytopenia,
increased bone marrow cellularity, and dys-
poiesis (data not shown). Basophilia was evi-
dent in some patients with AML. The most
common subtypes for cases with adequate
information to determine French-American
-British classification were AML-M2 and
AML-M3, but one patient was believed to
have either a myelomonocytic or monocytic
leukemia and another possibly megakaryo-
blastic leukemia (the latter classified as acute
leukemia not otherwise specified (NOS)
because pertinent immunohistochemical
stains ofbone marrow were not performed).
Several other patients were also classified as
acute leukemia NOS because of unavail-
ability of additional immunohistochemical
stains. Nevertheless, some AMLs and acute
leukemias NOS demonstrated dysplastic
changes in peripheral blood and bone mar-
row. Myelodysplastic syndromes, evident
among seven patients based on review of
histopathologic tissue or reports, included
refractory anemia, refractory anemia with
excess blasts, and chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia, with subclassification not possible
in three cases. Overall, findings for benzene-
exposed workers with myelodysplastic
syndromes included bone marrow hypocel-
lularity and marked dyserythropoietic
features such as multinuclearity, mega-
loblastoid changes, impaired hemoglo-
binization, abnormal nuclear shape, and
dimorphic morphology of red cells. Of
benzene-exposed patients with chronic
myeloid leukemia, most also demonstrated
dyserythropoiesis and dysgranulopoiesis, as
described earlier (22).
Based on available tissue and/or pathol-
ogy reports, we were often unable to update
diagnoses of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
(assigned during 1972-87) to reflect recent
advances in disease classification, since
immunohistochemical stains and other
appropriate tests had not been performed.
Frequently we could only maintain the
original diagnoses. In benzene-exposed
subjects, diagnoses included diffuse, deaved,
mixed-cell lymphoma or lymphosarcoma
(four cases of each); gastric lymphoma,
T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, malig-
nant lymphoma NOS (two each); and
poorly differentiated non-Hodgkin's lym-
phoma (one case). Among nonexposed
workers, diagnoses ofgastric lymphoma, dif-
fuse, cleaved, mixed lymphoma, and lym-
phosarcoma were each apparent in one
patient. Assigned diagnoses reflected the
evolution ofclassification schemes over sev-
eral decades as well as differences in levels
ofexpertise among pathologists in hospitals
throughout China.
Sixty-five (80%) of benzene-exposed
patients with HLD died during the study
period, including 39 of 42 with leukemia,
17 of 21 with lymphocytic/histiocytic dis-
orders, and 9 of 18 with nonmalignant
hematopoietic conditions. Similarly, all but
one of the 13 nonexposed HLD cases died.
Overall, benzene-exposed HLD patients had
somewhat, though not significantly, shorter
age-adjusted relative survival (median 0.8
year) than nonexposed patients with these
disorders (median 1.0 year); survival did
not vary by age (older versus younger than
the median) among exposed HLD patients
(median 0.7 year for both age groups), but
among nonexposed cases, younger persons
survived substantially longer (median 2.4
years) than older subjects (median 0.4 year).
Older benzene-exposed workers with AML
demonstrated no difference in survival by
exposure status (median 0.1 year for
benzene-exposed and for nonexposed), but
younger exposed patients had notably
shorter survival (median 0.2 years) than
nonexposed cases (median 1.0 year),
although none of these differences are sta-
tistically significant. There were too few
nonexposed workers with non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma and related tumors to evaluate
survival, but exposed older and younger
workers with these neoplasms had similar
survival (median approximately 1.0 year for
both age groups). For subjects with all non-
malignant hematopoietic disorders (all
were exposed), younger workers survived
substantially longer (median 9.6 years)
than older subjects (median 3.3 years).
Discussion
In one of the largest cohort studies of
benzene-exposed workers ever carried out,
we sought to validate and characterize clini-
copathologically all cases of HLD among
the exposed study population and the non-
exposed comparison group. Key among the
findings was a notable diversity of malig-
nant and nonneoplastic hematopoietic and
lymphoproliferative disorders, documenta-
tion of excess myelodysplastic syndromes
among benzene workers, and widespread
dyspoiesis involving all hematopoietic cell
lines among numerous patients. Overall,
survival of patients diagnosed with HLD
was poor but slightly (nonsignificantly)
shorter among benzene-exposed compared
with nonexposed patients, though some-
what (nonsignificantly) longer among
younger than older patients. Survival

differences must be interpreted cautiously,
however, because of small numbers and
multiple comparisons.
Compared with other cohort studies of
benzene-exposed workers or workers in
major occupational categories included in
the current series (4,5,7,18,19,32-71), the
present investigation is one of very few
using all available sources in addition to
death certificates to review HLD diagnoses
(Table 3). If one considers only the key
studies of benzene workers (3,5,7,8,16-19)
there is an impression that only two
hematopoietic disorders (AML and aplastic
anemia) are indisputably associated with
benzene exposure. Despite the limited and
generally qualitative nature of data demon-
strating a link between benzene exposure
and HLD outcomes, Table 3 reveals that
the specific industries included in the pres-
ent investigation are characterized by mor-
tality outcomes that include a wide range of
HLD (32-71). Relatively few studies have
attempted to evaluate quantitatively the
relationship between benzene or other spe-
cific solvents and HLD (5,8,14,18,51,
54,56) and none of these evaluated HLD
other than the leukemias. Thus, the absence
of clinical, hematologic, and/or pathologic
data in conjunction with few detailed
investigations of specific benzene measures
in relation to various HLD types has lim-
ited the opportunity to draw inferences
with regard to hematopoietic cell lines
targeted by benzene.
Fatal aplastic anemia was first reported
among benzene-exposed workers nearly
100 years ago (72), while leukemia was
initially linked with benzene exposure in
1928 (73). During the subsequent half
century, important series of leukemia cases
were described among benzene-exposed
printers in rotogravure plants and shoe-
makers in cottage shoe factories in Milan
and Pavia, Italy (15,74,75), exposed
workers in small shoe and handbag
factories in Istanbul, Turkey (3,16,17,76),
and hospitalized patients reporting prior
occupational exposure to benzene (77).
Case-control studies have also linked ben-
zene exposure (primarily occupational) with
leukemia (10,78,79). These clinical series,
case-control studies, and two important
cohort investigations (18,19,80) were con-
sidered to provide sufficient evidence to link
benzene with leukemia, particularly AML,
in humans (2). Subsequent cohort investi-
gations of benzene-exposed workers within
chemical manufacturing, petroleum refin-
ery, or other industries in the United States,
the United Kingdom, Italy, and China have
confirmed the benzene-leukemia association
(Table 3) (81,82). Although acute myeloid
leukemia, not otherwise characterized, has
been the type of malignancy most consis-
tently associated with benzene exposure,
other unusual variants of acute myeloid
leukemia, particularly erythroleukemia and
to a lesser extent acute myelomonocytic
leukemia, appear to occur disproportion-
ately in some studies of benzene-related
leukemia (15,83-85). While chronic
myeloid leukemia has been mentioned in
clinical reports (86,87), the only previous
cohort investigation in which this leukemia
type was noted was the first cohort study
by Yin et al. in China (6).
Lymphopoietic malignancies (including
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lym-
phoblastic leukemia, malignant lymphoma,
and multiple myeloma) have only infre-
quently been directly associated with ben-
zene exposure. More commonly, reports
indirectly suggest a possible link. For exam-
ple, two case-control investigations imply
that benzene may be related to increased
risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(10,78), a neoplasm observed in excess in
cohort and nested case-control studies of
rubber industry workers (43,51,54,56) and
long-term petroleum industry workers
(88-90). Hodgkin's disease has been
observed in a few cohorts of rubber indus-
try workers (43,47,58). Reports of ben-
zene-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia
have been limited to occasional case descrip-
tions (73), while speculation (9,85), but
few analytic investigations, has linked ben-
zene with multiple myeloma (7,8,85) or
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (5,91-93).
Explanations for the diversity of HLD
within the present study include additional
workplace and possibly residential exposure
to other solvents and chemicals as well as
differences in genetic or other susceptibility
factors between populations. Population-
based cancer registration data have shown
that Asians are characterized by low inci-
dence of chronic B-cell malignancies,
including chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
multiple myeloma, and subtypes of non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-cell origin
(94). While the types ofHLD among ben-
zene-exposed workers in our survey were
compared with those among a nonexposed
comparison group, there were no specific
features that distinguished HLD associated
with benzene exposure from those among
nonexposed subjects, with the possible
exception ofdyspoietic findings.
Aksoy (84) has noted that some case
series of benzene-related HLD include a
substantial proportion of individuals with
preleukemia (3,76). Yet, reports of preleu-
kemia among benzene-exposed workers only
rarely include descriptions of dyspoietic fea-
tures such as megaloblastoid dyserythro-
poiesis (17). There have also been reports of
benzene-exposed workers with varying
degrees of pancytopenia, among whom a
few have been observed to develop aplastic
anemia, then a preleukemic phase, fol-
lowed by a transformation to overt acute
myeloid leukemia (3,85). Honda and col-
leagues (95) and Cowles et al. (96) recently
reported excess myelodysplastic syndromes
and myelofibrosis during 1985 to 89 in con-
junction with a deficit in leukemia during
the same period among workers at a petro-
leum manufacturing and refining plant,
where excesses of leukemia (as well as
myelofibrosis though based on only two
cases) had been observed during 1940 to 84
(97-99). Changes in diagnostic or report-
ing practices were postulated to explain the
apparent shifts from leukemia to myelodys-
plastic syndromes and myelofibrosis (95).
Additional deceased workers employed in
this factory had myelofibrosis or preleu-
kemia reported as contributing causes
rather than underlying causes of death (the
latter coded as the official cause of death)
(95). Two workers from the same facility
whose cause of death was specified as "neo-
plasm of uncertain behavior" were also
found to have myeloproliferative disease
listed elsewhere on death certificates (95).
One other study of petroleum refinery
workers has also reported excess deaths
from myelofibrosis (100). Recent modifica-
tions to rules for coding death certificates,
revisions in the International Classification
of Diseases classification schemes, failure to
recognize these rare disorders, and other
problems may have affected ascertainment
of these and possibly other specific HLD
types. Aksoy (84) and others (101) have
pointed out that defined criteria often were
not used for myelodysplastic syndromes
until an internationally recognized classi-
fication scheme was published in the early
1980s (27). With one recent exception
(102), population-based incidence data
for the myelodysplastic syndromes have
not been published, nor have these disor-
ders been evaluated systematically in
cohorts of benzene-exposed workers. In
small case-control studies (12,103) and a
case series (11), however, myelodysplastic
syndromes have been linked with prior
exposure to gasoline or diesel exhaust
within the United Kingdom (12), to pesti-
cides or chemicals within the United States

(103), and to organic solvents within Italy
(11). These hematopoietic disorders also
develop after treatment with alkylating
agents or may precede transformation to
overt AML in chemotherapy-treated patients
developing secondary leukemia (104).
Characteristic hematotoxic effects of
benzene have been described for several
decades, although specific mechanisms of
action are still being elucidated. The most
common reported abnormalities are periph-
eral pancytopenias, although anemia,
leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia individ-
ually have been noted (105). As early as
1941, Goldwater (106) observed that an
absolute lymphocytopenia was a relatively
frequent and early manifestation of benzene
hematotoxicity. Recently, we observed a
decreased absolute lymphocyte count
among healthy workers with moderate-to-
high exposures to benzene compared with
nonexposed controls in Shanghai (107).
Though the finding of benzene-associated
lymphocytopenia has been confirmed by
some (108), others have failed to find this
result (109,110). However, administration
of benzene to rats, mice, and rabbits has
been shown to produce a dose-dependent
decrease in the number of lymphocytes,
which may precede the drop in levels of
other blood cells (111). Similarly, lympho-
cytes are extremely sensitive to ionizing radi-
ation, another known leukemogen (112).
Unfortunately, few workers within the pre-
sent study underwent systematic evaluation
prior to onset of symptoms associated with
HLD. Also, no patient with AML had been
previously diagnosed with aplastic anemia,
nor did any of those diagnosed with
myelodysplastic syndromes subsequently
develop acute myeloid leukemia. It should
be noted, however, that several patients
died of complications related to myelodys-
plastic syndromes.
As we pointed out earlier (22), we
observed considerable overlap in hematologic
features present within several AMLs within
our survey and those described for leukemias
secondary to alkylating agents or radiother-
apy (104). These findings included dys-
myelopoietic changes (113,114) and the
common occurrence ofanemia, thrombocy-
topenia, and increased bone marrow cellu-
larity. While some of these features have
been observed in previous descriptions of
benzene-related AML, we were the first to
report dyspoiesis among benzene workers
with a variety of HLD (22). We also
observed basophilia among several patients
with acute myeloid leukemia, although this
finding has not been considered to be
characteristic of chronic benzene toxicity
(84,108). Treatment-related leukemias are
distinct clinicopathologic entities based on
morphologic and cytogenetic abnormali-
ties (104,115). Although cytogenetic
studies were not performed as part of the
routine diagnostic evaluation ofHLD cases
arising among Chinese benzene-exposed
workers, morphologic and hematologic
similarities between our cases and treat-
ment-related AMLs suggest possible simi-
larities in pathogenesis, perhaps involving
damage to marrow stem cells and/or extra-
medullary mediators of carcinogenesis.
Similarly, a recent clinicopathologic descrip-
tion ofAML following exposure to organic
solvents revealed comparable types of
abnormalities (116).
The major limitation ofour study is the
historical nature inherent within retrospec-
tive cohort investigations. Particularly for
workers within early years of the study
period, incomplete characterization of HLD
diagnoses at initial presentation was com-
mon. Ideally, work-up of patients with
newly diagnosed HLD should include
immunohistochemical stains on histopatho-
logic specimens in addition to cytogenetic,
immunophenotypic, and other studies.
Currently, we are initiating extended fol-
low-up of this cohort, and efforts are being
made to implement up-to-date evaluation
ofall HLD.
Nevertheless, our study of benzene-
exposed workers is one of the first occupa-
tional investigations in which HLD
outcomes for a large proportion (close to
90%) ofcases have been validated through
standardized review of medical records or
diagnostic pathology-related data. As
routine clinicopathologic characterization
of individual patients and classification
schemes for all categories of HLD have
become increasingly sophisticated, it is
hoped that future epidemiologic investiga-
tions of benzene workers will incorporate
the approach for outcome assessment that
we have described. In the extended follow-
up ofthis cohort, we will continue to utilize
all available clinical, laboratory hematologic,
and pathologic data as well as cytogenetic
and biochemical markers to characterize
HLD outcomes. Workers diagnosed with
aplastic and myelodysplastic syndromes
will also continue to be followed after diag-
nosis for evolution of these conditions to
acute myeloid leukemia. We are also con-
sidering a prospective evaluation ofworkers
diagnosed with benzene poisoning by
means of various biochemical and molecu-
lar markers that might be associated with
the subsequent development of HLD. It is
hoped that these studies might eventually
lead to identification of patients who are
particularly susceptible to benzene toxicity
and carcinogenesis, and, conversely, descrip-
tion of molecular/biochemical profiles that
correlate with resistance to these end points.
These facets of our investigations are
designed to provide further clarification of
underlying molecular mechanisms of leuke-
mogenesis and development of HLD, with
possible implications for other hematopoi-
etic carcinogens such as ionizing radiation
and chemotherapeutic agents.
