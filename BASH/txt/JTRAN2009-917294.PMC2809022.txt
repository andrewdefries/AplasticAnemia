The prognosis of patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) who require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU)
has been regarded as extremely poor. We sought to re-evaluate recent outcomes and predictive factors in a retrospective cohort
study. Among the 605 adult patients that received an HSCT between 2001 and 2006, 154 required admission to the ICU. Of these,
47% were discharged from the ICU, 36% were discharged from the hospital, and 19% survived 6 months. Allogeneic transplant,
mechanical ventilation, vasopressor-use, and neutropenia were each associated with increased mortality, and the mortality of
patients with all four characteristics was 100%. Hemodialysis was also associated with increased mortality in a Kaplan-Meier
analysis but did not appear important in a multivariate tree analysis. A ﬁnal Cox model conﬁrmed that allogeneic transplant,
mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor-use were each independent risk factors for mortality in the 6 months following ICU
admission.

1. Introduction
The use of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) has
become the standard of care for many types of hematologic
malignancies, including acute and chronic leukemias and
lymphomas. Unfortunately, HSCT is often associated with
severe complications, including infection, respiratory failure
from multiple etiologies, graft versus host disease, bleeding,
sepsis, and multiorgan failure [1–4]. These complications
can occur acutely, especially during the period of neutrope-
nia when patients are profoundly immunocompromised or
at a later time after hospital discharge [5]. Such complica-
tions often require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU)
for higher level of care. The reported range of admission to
the ICU is between 11% and 40% of all HSCT recipients
[5, 6]. This range is likely due to the diﬀerences in acuity level
required for ICU admission and the diﬀerences in percent of
allogeneic transplants at diﬀerent institutions.
Previous studies have shown that HSCT patients who
require ICU admission often face a very poor prognosis, with
mortality ranging from 54% to 92% and always above 80%
when mechanical ventilation is required [6–9]. While the
decision to limit aggressive care in HSCT patients is often
diﬃcult, identiﬁcation of prognostic factors can aid in the
counseling of patients and families so that the use of futile
measures can be minimized.
Over the past few decades, advances in the procedure
and care of patients after transplantation may have improved
survival. Given the signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and emotional costs
associated with ICU care, it is important to be able to
provide clinicians, patients, and families with the most
current estimates of mortality and prognostic factors for
HSCT patients who require ICU admission. In this study,
we evaluated the clinical characteristics of HSCT patients
who required ICU admission, their survival rates, and the
characteristics that predict adverse outcome. Furthermore,
2 Journal of Transplantation
we compared the survival of patients who were admitted to
the ICU during their initial hospitalization for HSCT to the
survival of patients who required ICU care when readmitted
after they have been discharged status posttransplant.
2. Patients and Methods
2.1. Patients and Data. With IRB approval, we retrospec-
tively reviewed all adult patients who had received HSCTs
who were admitted to the University of California at Los
Angeles Medical Center intensive care unit during the ﬁve-
year period between July 2001 and June 2006. Clinical charts
were reviewed to document each patient’s age, gender, type
of malignancy, type of HSCT (allogeneic versus autologous),
underlying disease, reason for ICU admission, and length
of ICU stay. We documented whether the patient was neu-
tropenic, which is deﬁned by an absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) of <500 during any point during their ICU admis-
sion and whether the patient had signs of GVHD. Organ
failure was assessed by establishing whether the patient
required invasive mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or
hemodialysis during their ICU stay. In our institution, the
use of organ failure support, such as mechanical ventilation
after intubation, vasopressor support, or continuous renal
replacement therapy, is restricted to the ICU.
Survival to discharge from the ICU, from the hospital,
and up to 6 months after ICU admission was assessed. For
patients who had more than one admission to the ICU,
only the ﬁrst admission was used for analysis. Patients who
were discharged from the ICU and transferred back to the
ward, regardless of ultimate outcome, were considered to
have survived the ICU.
2.2. Statistical Analysis. Data were reported as proportions,
means (±SD), or medians (intraquartile range) where
they are appropriate and as indicated within the text and
tables. ICU, Hospital, and 6-month survival proportions in
autologous and allogeneic HSCT patients were compared
with chi-square tests. The predetermined primary objective
of this study was the identiﬁcation of independent prognostic
variables for survival in the 6 months following ICU
admission in HSCT patients. Potential prognostic variables
were ﬁrst screened by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Promising
variables (P-value <.10 by Mantel-Cox log-rank test) were
then included in a tree model to inform about associations
and a variable’s level of importance. The tree was constructed
using the partition modeling feature included in the JMP
7 software package. The software was allowed to determine
the best next cut, and additional cuts were not made to a
branch with a sample size less than 30. Finally, guided by
the rule of 10, the “best” 3 variables were determined from
the ﬁrst 3 cuts in the tree model and included in a ﬁnal
multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards model of survival for
the 6 months following ICU admission.
In additional exploratory studies, the study cohort was
further divided and analyzed in three subgroups: the HSCT
Admission group consisted of patients who were admitted to
the ICU during the course of their initial hospitalization for
hematopoietic transplant (n = 70), the Early Readmission
group was patients who were discharged from the hospital
status post-HSCT but who require ICU admission within
100 days of their transplant (n = 33), and the Late
Readmission group was HSCT patients who required ICU
admission more than 100 days after their transplant (n = 51).
Six-month survival rates were compared among the three
groups.
3. Results
3.1. HSCT and ICU Admission. UCLA performed 605 adult
HSCT transplants (400 autologous, 205 allogeneic) during
this study period. Three patients admitted to the ICU for
monitoring after elective surgeries were excluded from our
study. After the exclusion of these patients, 154 patients,
or 25% of the total adult HSCT cohort, required 179
ICU admissions. Admission to the ICU was more common
after allogeneic transplant (46%) than autologous transplant
(15%). During the initial hospitalization for HSCT, 70
patients (11.6% of the total cohort) required admission
to the ICU. Similarly, during the initial hospitalization for
HSCT, ICU admission was more common after allogeneic
transplant (22.4%) than autologous transplant (6%).
3.2. HSCT Patient Characteristics. The characteristics of
these 154 HSCT patients admitted to the ICU are sum-
marized in Table 1. There were 91 males and 63 females.
Overall, the top three underlying diseases that necessitated
HSCT were acute myeloid leukemia (29%), non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (21%), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (16%).
The average age was 44 (range was 18–77), and the median
length of ICU stay was 5 days (IQR 2, 11). Sixty-ﬁve
patients (68%) had signs of GVHD, and 66 patients (43%)
were neutropenic at one point during their ICU admission.
Mechanical ventilation was required in 110 patients (71%),
vasopressor-use was required in 104 patients (66%), and
dialysis was required in 63 patients (41%). The majority of
patients who needed mechanical ventilation or vasopressors
during their ICU admission required initiation of these
interventions on their ﬁrst ICU day, while initiation of
HD generally occurred during the ﬁrst week or not at all
(Figure 1). During this study, the initial vasopressor choice
was norepinephrine. Neosynephrine or vasopressin may have
been added as second agents when needed. The reasons
for ICU admissions are summarized in Table 2. The most
frequent reasons for ICU admission were respiratory failure
and hemodynamic instability. Neurologic conditions that
necessitated ICU admission included seizures, profound
altered mental status, or subdural monitoring.
3.3. Outcome of HSCT Patients Admitted to the ICU. Among
the 154 HSCT patients who required ICU admission, 47%
(72 patients) were discharged from the ICU, 36% (55
patients) were discharged from the hospital, and 19% (30
patients) were alive at 6-month followup. Five patients
discharged from the ICU were discharged for hospice
arrangement and terminal care. In the 6 months following

ICU admission, survival was generally better in autologous
HSCT patients than in allogeneic HSCT patients (Figure 2).
A greater proportion of autologous than allogeneic HSCT
patients survived to ICU discharge (61% versus 38%, P =
.005), hospital discharge (56% versus 22%, P < .001) and for
at least 6 months after the ICU admission (31% versus 13%,
P = .007).
3.4. Prognostic Characteristics. We examined the impact
of potential prognostic factors by comparison of Kaplan-
Meier survival curves for the 6 months following ICU
admission (Figure 2). A requirement of mechnical venti-
lation, vasopressor-use, hemodialysis, or the presence of
neutropenia was each associated with increased mortality
when examined alone. Because these variables often occurred
together in the same patient, we explored for interactions and
the level of importance in a tree model (Figure 4). In this
model, each negative prognostic factor increased mortality,
and patients with the 4 most important prognostic factors
(allogeneic transplant, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor-
use, and neutropenia) had 100% mortality. Hemodialysis did
not factor in this model.
Based on the tree model, allogeneic transplant, mechan-
ical ventilation, and vasopressor-use were determined to be
the “best” prognostic variables for predicting the risk of
mortality in the 6 months after ICU admission, and these
variables were included in a multivariate Cox proportional
hazards model. In this model, allogeneic HSCT, mechanical
ventilation, and vasopressor requirement were each indepen-
dent risk factors for mortality (Table 3).
3.5. Timing of ICU Admission and Outcome. When the study
population was separated by the timing of ICU admission,
we found that 70 patients were admitted to the ICU during
the course of their initial hospitalization for HSCT (HSCT
Admission Group), 33 patients were admitted to the ICU
after being discharged but who were still within 100 days of
their transplant (Early Readmission Group), and 51 patients
required ICU admission after more than 100 days after
their transplant (Late Readmission Group). In the HSCT
Admission Group, 49% (34) were discharged from the ICU,
34% (24) were discharged from the hospital, and 20% (14)
were alive at 6 months after ICU admission. The Early
Readmission Group had the lowest ICU, hospital, and 6-
month survival (36%, 21%, and 12%, resp.). The Late
Readmission Group’s survival for the ICU, hospital, and at
6 months was 51%, 47%, and 24%, respectively. In general,
survival in the 6 months following ICU admission was
signiﬁcantly worse in the Early Readmission Group than in
the Late Readmission Group (Figure 5).
Among allogeneic HSCT patients in the HSCT Admis-
sion Group, the presence of GVHD was associated with

improved 6-month survival (Figure 6). Most patients in this
group (75%) were admitted to the ICU within two weeks of
their transplant, and thus were unlikely to have engrafted in
order to develop GVHD. The presence of GVHD during later
ICU admissions and for the total cohort had no signiﬁcant
eﬀect on survival (data not shown).
4. Discussion
Although HSCT is the treatment of choice for many types of
hematologic malignancies, it continues to be associated with
considerable morbidity and mortality. Early studies have
reported survival rates less than 20% and often approaching
0% once mechanical ventilation become necessary [6, 7].
An earlier report at our own institution demonstrated that
only 1 out of 40 bone marrow transplant patients who
were intubated for acute respiratory failure survived to ICU
discharge [10]. That one individual developed recurrent
leukemia and died within 10 months. With such poor
outcomes, the use of costly aggressive interventions for these
patients has been questioned [7, 10, 11]. However, more
recent studies have suggested that the prognosis of HSCT
patients requiring ICU admission has improved over the
last two decades [5, 12, 13], and our data support this
conclusion. In this study, the overall ICU, hospital, and 6
month survival was 47%, 36%, and 19%, respectively. For
mechanically ventilated patients, the survival was 30%, 22%,
and 13%, respectively. The reason for this improvement is
likely multifactorial. The wider use of peripheral cells as the
source of stem cells has been associated with shorter time to
engraftment [14], and faster platelet and neutrophil recovery
likely decrease the risks of opportunistic infections and life-
threatening bleeding. Price et al. were able to demonstrate
that recipients of peripheral blood stem cell transplants have

a more favorable outcome than bone marrow transplant
patients should they require mechanical ventilation [8]. In
addition, the use of less myeloablative conditioning has been
shown to reduce posttransplant morbidity [15]. It is also
possible that there has been improvement in critical care
management with the advent of early goal directed therapy
and improved mechanical ventilation strategies for acute
lung injury [16, 17].

Other recent studies have reported survival after ICU
admission in HSCT patients that is better than in our
study. Soubani et al. report a 61% ICU-survival, and Afessa
et al. report a 54% hospital survival [5, 6]. The diﬀerent
ﬁndings between these and our own study may be a result of
variable utilization of ICU-level care at diﬀerent institutions
and diﬀerences in baseline patient population. Ninety-three
percent of our study population had evidence of organ failure
requiring dialysis, mechanical ventilation, or hemodynamic
support, and it is possible that our results represent the
outcome of more critically ill patients as well as high-risk
patients receiving HSCTs. In addition, 62% of this study’s
population had an allogeneic transplant, which is known to
put patients at higher risk as it is frequently complicated

by GVHD and prolonged periods of immunosuppression
[18]. This is further supported by our data that show a 4-
fold greater incidence of ICU admission in allogeneic HSCT
patients as compared to autologous HSCT patients.
The principal aim of our study was to identify the char-
acteristics of HSCT patients admitted to the ICU that predict
poor outcome. Multiple other studies have sought to identify
the variables that might predict worse outcome [5, 7, 9, 11,
14, 18–20]. Unfortunately, there has not been consensus, and
Jackson et al. and Evison et al. found that pre-ICU admission
variables could not be used to predict mortality [21, 22]. In
our study, we found that allogeneic transplant, mechanical
ventilation, neutropenia, vasopressor-use, and hemodialysis
were each signiﬁcantly associated with decreased 6-month
survival when examined individually. When these variables

were included together in a tree model of 6-month survival,
allogeneic transplant, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor-
use, and neutropenia were each associated with increased
mortality. In this model, the source of transplant was
the ﬁrst cut made and therefore appears to be the most
important determinant of 6-month mortality, with 69%
mortality in autologous HSCT patients and 87% mortality
in allogeneic HSCT patients admitted to the ICU. This
result is not surprising in view of the fact that allogeneic
transplants are associated with longer engraftment periods,
longer periods of neutropenia, and are often complicated by
GVHD, which then require profound and prolonged periods
of immunosuppression. While hemodialysis was associated
with increased mortality in the univariate analysis, it was
surprisingly not a factor in the multivariate tree model.
Hemodialysis was never an indication for ICU admission
alone and therefore occurred in the presence of respiratory
failure or hemodynamic instability. This ﬁnding suggests
that the requirement for hemodialysis does not add to
the risk of other associated negative prognostic variables.
However, this conclusion is admittedly limited by the small
number of patients who required hemodialysis in this study.
Importantly, a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model
conﬁrmed that allogeneic transplant, ventilator requirement,
and vasopressor-use were each independent risk factors for
mortality in the 6 months following ICU admission.
We also explored the eﬀect of timing of ICU admission
in subgroup analyses. We ﬁnd that patients in the Early
Readmission group, which are patients who have been
discharged status post-HSCT but who are within 100 days of
their transplant, have a worse 6-month outcome than those
admitted later. Only 12% of the Early Readmission Group
survives 6 months after ICU admission. To our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst study to evaluate patients who have been
discharged from the hospital after HSCT, divide them into
groups in this manner, and ﬁnd that patients who require
ICU admission soon after discharge have a worse 6-month
Journal of Transplantation 7
prognosis. Soubani et al. found that the majority of HSCT
patients who require ICU level care do so within the ﬁrst
100 days of their transplant [5], and we ﬁnd that these
patients also have a worse outcome, particularly if they were
already discharged from the hospital after their transplant.
We suspect that the patients in the Early Readmission Group
may be especially vulnerable because they remain at high
risk of complications but do not have access to immediate
care when they start to deteriorate. Our result emphasizes the
need to be attuned to the special risks and complications of
patients who have had a recent HSCT and to be aggressive
in their treatment especially when these patients require
readmission, as they can deteriorate rapidly.
Previous studies have shown that GVHD, either through
direct complications or by requiring immunosuppression
that increase infection susceptibility, is an important risk
factor in predicting mortality in allogeneic transplants [23].
Afessa et al. found that GVHD was associated with increased
mortality in patients admitted to the ICU [13]. In our study,
GVHD was surprisingly associated with improved survival in
the HSCT Admission Group. We suspect that in this group,
the presence of GVHD was a marker for engraftment and for
a later time point posttransplantation, both of which may
be associated with a better prognosis for survival after an
ICU admission. This hypothesis is supported by the ﬁnding
that, in the HSCT Admission group, patients with GVHD
were admitted to the ICU at a signiﬁcantly later time-point
posttransplantation than those without GVHD (14 days,
intraquartile range 11–31 days versus 9 days, intraquartile
range 2–14 days, resp.; P = .003). In the other subgroups,
and for the entire cohort, GVHD had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on
survival.
Our study has shown that the outcome of HSCT patients
who require ICU-level care is not as poor as previously
described. Our own institution has seen an improvement
in the survival of HSCT patients who require mechani-
cal ventilation. However, although ICU-level care may be
appropriate, mortality does remain high in this patient
population, particularly among those who had an allogeneic
transplant, require vasopressors or mechanical ventilation,
or are neutropenic. As seen by our tree model (Figure 4),
each of these factors negatively aﬀects the prognosis for
6-month survival in HSCT patients admitted to the ICU.
Furthermore, the reported ICU survival rate of the unse-
lected, heterogeneous ICU population is about 70% [24] and
thus better than that of HSCT patients (47%). Therefore,
clinicians need to be encouraged to use studies like ours
to provide patients with accurate estimates of outcome and
initiate early discussions regarding advance directives. As
recommended by Crawford and Rubenfeld in the original
study regarding hematopoietic transplant and ICU care, “the
goal of HSCT is to cure the underlying condition and return
the patient to an acceptable quality of life. When these goals
are no longer attainable, intensive life support should cease”
[7]. Nonetheless, with advances in technology and medicine,
both the eﬀectiveness of ICU therapeutic modalities and
hematopoietic transplantation may improve. It is important
that we continue to monitor the eﬀects of these changes on
outcome over time.
