Abstract: Regular blood transfusions as supportive care for patients with chronic anemia
inevitably lead to iron overload as humans cannot actively remove excess iron. The cumulative
effects of iron overload cause significant morbidity and mortality if not effectively treated with
chelation therapy. Based on a comprehensive clinical development program, the once-daily,
oral iron chelator deferasirox (Exjade®
) is approved for the treatment of transfusional iron
overload in adult and pediatric patients with various transfusion-dependent anemias, including
β-thalassemia and the myelodysplastic syndromes. Deferasirox dose should be titrated for each
individual patient based on transfusional iron intake, current iron burden and whether the goal
is to decrease or maintain body iron levels. Doses of 30 mg/kg/day have been shown to be
effective with a safety profile consistent with that observed at doses 30 mg/kg/day. Recent
data have highlighted the ability of deferasirox to decrease cardiac iron levels and to prevent
the accumulation of iron in the heart. The long-term efficacy and safety of deferasirox for up to
5 years of treatment have now been established. The availability of this effective and generally
well tolerated oral therapy represents a significant advance in the management of transfusional
iron overload.

Iron overload and chelation therapy
The human body has many mechanisms to absorb, transfer and store essential dietary
iron, but none to excrete excess amounts. It is therefore inevitable that patients who
undergo regular transfusion therapy to treat chronic anemia, such as those with
β-thalassemia and the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), will develop iron overload,
since every unit of blood contains approximately 200 mg of iron.1
Iron overload from
transfusions may be exacerbated in some patients due to increased absorption of iron
from the diet in response to ineffective erythropoiesis.2
Excess iron is deposited in
parenchymal tissue, including the liver, heart and endocrine system, which leads to
ongoing damage and, ultimately, to organ failure.
Iron chelation therapy is the only viable option for the treatment of transfusional
iron overload and can prevent further cellular iron uptake and reduce levels of morbidity
and mortality in regularly transfused patients.3–5
Deferoxamine (DFO; Desferal®
) is the
current standard of care for iron chelation therapy; however, as DFO is a large molecule
with a short half-life (20 to 30 minutes), treatment requires a demanding regimen of
slow continuous infusion over 8 to 12 hours, 5 to 7 days/week, which often results in
poor compliance.6
The 3-times daily chelator deferiprone (Ferriprox®
) was the first oral
chelator to reach market and it is currently available in a number of countries outside

the USA and Canada for the second-line treatment of iron
overload in adult patients with thalassemia major for whom
DFO therapy is contraindicated or inadequate.7
The use of
deferiprone has partly been restricted due to the occurrence
of serious adverse events such as arthropathy (common),
neutropenia and agranulocytosis (rare).8,9
Deferasirox (Exjade®
), which became available in
2005, is an oral iron chelator that requires once-daily
administration. It is currently approved in more than
90 countries for the treatment of chronic iron overload
due to blood transfusions in pediatric and adult patients.10
Deferasirox has been evaluated in patients with a wide range
of underlying anemias and a wealth of clinical data is now
available. This review will provide an update on the use
of deferasirox, primarily focusing on the recent long-term
efficacy and safety data available from the extension studies,
new analyses in patients with MDS, aplastic anemia (AA)
and Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), as well as updates
on the effects of deferasirox on cardiac iron levels.
Pharmacodynamics
and pharmacokinetics of deferasirox
Chemistry and pharmacodynamic
properties
Deferasirox represents a new class of tridentate iron
chelators, the N-substituted bis-hydroxyphenyl-triazoles.11
As a tridentate iron chelator, two molecules are required
to form a stable complex with each iron (Fe3+
) atom; the
active molecule in deferasirox (ICL670) is highly lipophilic
and 99% protein bound. Deferasirox has a high affinity and
selectivity for Fe3+
, which is approximately 14 and 21 orders
of magnitude greater than its affinity for copper or zinc,
respectively, which minimizes the potential for depletion of
these trace elements.12
Animal models in several species, such
as rats, gerbils and marmosets, demonstrated that deferasirox
could efficiently and selectively mobilize iron from various
tissues such as hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes, and could
also promote iron excretion.11,13,14
Deferasirox is primarily
metabolized by glucuronidation, with subsequent biliary
excretion, and the deferasirox–iron complex is excreted in
the feces.15
Pharmacokinetic properties
Deferasirox is rapidly absorbed with a median tmax
of
1 to 2 hours and a mean elimination half-life of 7 to
16 hours.16
The plasma concentration of deferasirox is
proportional to the administered dose17,18
and plasma levels
are maintained within the therapeutic range over 24 hours
following once-daily administration.16
Cmax
, area-under-curve
and half-life are similar in children (aged  12 years) and
adolescents (aged  12 years). Exposure to deferasirox is
approximately 20% to 30% lower in children and adolescents
than in adults,17
and is significantly lower in pediatric patients
aged 6 years compared with older pediatric patients.These
factors may add an additional margin for tolerability and
mean that pediatric patients require higher deferasirox doses
than adults to achieve comparable efficacy. As the bioavail-
ability of deferasirox is affected by food when consumed
concomitantly, it is recommended that it is administered at
least 30 minutes before eating.19
Efficacy of deferasirox
Introduction to deferasirox clinical trials
The clinical efficacy of deferasirox has been thoroughly
evaluatedinpatientswithawiderangeoftransfusion-dependent
anemias, including β-thalassemia, MDS, sickle cell disease
(SCD),AA, DBA and other rare anemias. Five pivotal 1-year
core studies were conducted in more than 1000 patients,16,20–23
while more than 900 patients were enrolled into subsequent
extension studies and will receive treatment with deferasirox
for up to a further 4 years. A wealth of data are also now
available from a global program of additional studies, the
largest of which include ESCALATOR (237 patients with
β‑thalassemia)24,25
and EPIC (1744 patients with various
underlying anemias)26
(Table 1).
Factors impacting on deferasirox efficacy
The pivotal 1-year clinical studies demonstrated that the effi-
cacy of deferasirox is dependent on both dose and ongoing
transfusional iron intake.16,20–23,27
Although doses of 5 and
10 mg/kg/day are able to effectively remove iron they are
generally insufficient to balance the iron uptake from regular
blood transfusions. Doses of 20 to 30 mg/kg/day are able
to maintain or reduce body iron burden depending on iron
intake.
For most patients the recommended starting dose for
deferasirox is 20 mg/kg/day,18
however this dose can be
modified based on iron intake, current iron burden and
a patient’s individual therapeutic goal (ie, whether the
aim is to decrease or maintain body iron levels);10
local
prescribing information should be consulted. If necessary,
deferasirox dose adjustments should be made in steps of
5 to 10 mg/kg/day every 3 to 6 months based on serum ferritin
trends. Data from the ESCALATOR study suggested that
a starting dose of 20 mg/kg/day is insufficient to decrease

Dovepress
iron burden in heavily iron-overloaded patients, since dose
increases above 20 mg/kg/day were required in 185/237
patients (78%) in the initial 1-year treatment period.24
Further
dose increases were performed in 137/233 patients (59%)
in the extension study, with increases to 30 mg/kg/day
necessary in 112 patients; significant improvements in liver
iron concentration (LIC) and serum ferritin were observed
following these dose increases (Figure 1).25
The importance
of timely and appropriate deferasirox dose adjustments
to enable patients to achieve target serum ferritin levels
has also been highlighted in the extension phases of the
pivotal studies. Patients who initially received deferasirox
5/10 mg/kg/day had increases in serum ferritin during the
core 1-year treatment period, however a gradual decline in
iron burden to below baseline levels was observed once doses
were subsequently increased.28,29
Figure 2 shows that doses
of 20 mg/kg/day were necessary before patients were able
to achieve a significant reduction in serum ferritin.28
The dosing approach used in the EPIC study accounted
for iron intake as patients received initial deferasirox doses
of 10 to 30 mg/kg/day depending on transfusion history,
followed by dose titration in steps of 5 to 10 mg/kg/day
every 3 months according to serum ferritin trends and
safety markers.26,27
Changes in serum ferritin over the
1-year treatment period were reflective of dosage adjust-
ments and mean iron intake (Figure 3).26
Significant
decreases in serum ferritin were observed in each overall
disease cohort (Table 2).30–34
These data from the EPIC study
show that it is important to regularly monitor transfusional
iron intake and serum ferritin levels during deferasirox
therapy in order to optimize dosing.
Some patients will require escalation to 30 mg/kg/day
to achieve therapeutic goals. A retrospective analysis of
228patientswhoreceiveddeferasiroxdosesof 30mg/kg/day
in the extension studies and ESCALATOR demonstrated a
significant reduction in median serum ferritin of 370 ng/mL
(P0.001)frompre-dose-escalationtothetime-of-analysis.35
These findings have important implications for patients who
are heavily transfused and may require higher doses of
deferasirox to reduce body iron burden.
Efficacy across different
underlying anemias
β-thalassemia major
As complications of iron overload have been most widely
studied in β-thalassemia major, this population was the
primary focus of the deferasirox clinical trial program.
The efficacy of deferasirox in this population was clearly
demonstrated in the pivotal 1-year Phase III study
(n = 296), where doses of 20 or 30 mg/kg/day provided
dose-dependent changes in LIC and serum ferritin.20
These
data were confirmed in several trials including EPIC, where

937 patients with β-thalassemia major were enrolled and
where a significant decrease in serum ferritin was observed
after 1 year of deferasirox treatment (Table 2).30
In the
ESCALATOR study, the proportion of β-thalassemia major
patients with a LIC of 7 mg Fe/g dry weight (dw) increased
from 9.9% at baseline, to 26.2% at 1 year and 44.4% at the
end of study (median of 2.7 years).25
With appropriate dose
adjustments, deferasirox continues to be effective over the
long term in patients with β‑thalassemia major, a finding
that is supported by data from the extension studies over a
median treatment period of 4.5 years (Figure 2).28
Cardiac failure related to myocardial iron overload is the
leading cause of death in regularly transfused patients with
β-thalassemia major.4,36
Evidence for the ability of deferasirox
to remove cardiac iron in patients with β-thalassemia major
has been demonstrated in a number of studies.37–41
The
largest of these was a substudy of EPIC, where deferasirox
significantly improved myocardialT2* in patients with mild,
moderate and severe myocardial siderosis (11.2 ms at baseline
to 12.9 ms at 12 months; P  0.0001) (Figure 4a).41
Left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a useful surrogate
marker of cardiac function and is often used when evaluating
the cardiac efficacy of an iron chelator. It was evaluated in
the EPIC and ESCALATOR trials, which enrolled patients
with baseline LVEF within the reference range for healthy
adults (ie, 56%). LVEF, as measured by echocardiogram
or cardiovascular magnetic resonance, was maintained at
approximately 67% in the EPIC substudy,41
and improved
significantly from 65.1% to 66.8% (P = 0.0002) in the 1-year
core ESCALATOR study.24
As well as removing iron from
the heart, deferasirox may also prevent the accumulation of
cardiac iron in iron-overloaded patients with normal cardiac
iron levels (Figure 4b).42
This ability may potentially help in
preventing future cardiac failure associated with myocardial
siderosis in patients with β-thalassemia major.
β-thalassemia intermedia
Although patients with β-thalassemia intermedia are rarely
transfused they are still at risk for developing iron overload
due to increased intestinal iron absorption secondary to
chronic anemia. Few studies with chelation therapy have
been conducted in this population to date. However, data
are emerging from small numbers of patients demonstrating
that deferasirox can significantly decrease mean serum
ferritin levels over 1 year of treatment (1356 to 914 ng/mL,
P  0.05;43
2030 to 1165 ng/mL, P = 0.02,44
at doses of 10 to
20 mg/kg/day, respectively). A large prospective study is
underway to fully evaluate the use of deferasirox in patients
with thalassemia intermedia.
Myelodysplastic syndromes

in maintaining or reducing body iron burden in patients

with MDS.22,31,45–48
As in the β-thalassemia population,
deferasirox has dose-dependent efficacy in patients with
MDS.22
The largest cohort of MDS patients (n = 341) ever
assessed with iron chelation therapy were enrolled in the
EPIC study; with appropriate dose adjustments, significant
reductions in serum ferritin were noted after 1 year of
deferasirox treatment (Table 2).26,31
Another large study in
176 heavily iron-overloaded MDS patients also showed
decreases in serum ferritin.46
Preliminary data suggest that
in addition to decreases in serum ferritin, improvements
in hematological parameters can occur with deferasirox
treatment in patients with MDS.49
Serum ferritin decreases
during deferasirox treatment in patients with MDS have
been shown to be associated with significant improvements
in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which is an indicator of
hepatocellular injury.47,50
This is of importance given that
liver dysfunction is a common complication in MDS;51,52
prospective studies are warranted to further investigate this
observation. MDS patients who are most likely to benefit
from receiving chelation therapy are transfusion-dependent
patients with lower-risk MDS (ie, Low or Int-1 International
Prognostic Scoring System) and life expectancy 1 year, who
have serum ferritin levels of 1000 ng/mL.53,54
Sickle cell disease
Deferasirox has also demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy
in the SCD population.23
In one Phase II study in adult
and pediatric patients, LIC was significantly reduced from
baseline after 1 year of deferasirox treatment (P  0.05).23
Serum ferritin levels were also decreased, although there
was substantial intrapatient variability. Deferasirox doses of
10 to 30 mg/kg/day were shown to have similar efficacy to
DFO. Of 195 patients enrolled in this 1-year study, 132 entered
the ongoing extension phase. To date, these patients have
received deferasirox for a median treatment period of
3.1 years and have shown continued reduction in serum
ferritin levels (–651 ng/mL from baseline; P = 0.0533).55
Further evidence for the efficacy of deferasirox in SCD
is emerging from smaller studies that have demonstrated
substantial reductions in serum ferritin and liver iron levels
over 1 year.56,57
Aplastic anemia, Diamond-Blackfan anemia,
and other rare anemias
Patients with AA, DBA and other types of rare anemia often
require blood transfusions as supportive therapy; however,
the efficacy of chelation therapy has rarely been evaluated
in these populations.A 1-year prospective Phase II trial with
deferasirox included 30 patients with DBA and 22 patients
with other rare anemias (including AA, α-thalassemia and
sideroblastic anemia).22
Significant, dose-dependent effects
on LIC and serum ferritin were observed in both groups
over the 1-year treatment period.22,58,59
Patients with AA
(n = 116), DBA (n = 14) and rare anemias (n = 43) were also
enrolled in the EPIC study and significant overall reductions
in serum ferritin from baseline to 1 year were observed in
each of the disease groups (Table 2).32–34
As with the overall
EPIC population, changes in serum ferritin were reflective
of dose adjustments and iron intake during the study.A simi-
lar observation has been made based on interim data from
50 patients withAA in Korea, where significant reductions in
mean LIC (P = 0.01) and serum ferritin (4185 to 2913 ng/mL,
P  0.01) were noted over the 1-year treatment period.48
Pediatric patients
The deferasirox clinical trial program included patients with
a wide range of ages. Pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years)
were well represented, comprising approximately 40% of
all patients enrolled in the five pivotal studies. When used
at appropriate doses for the degree of iron burden and the
ongoing transfusional iron intake, deferasirox provides dose-
dependent efficacy in pediatric patients for up to 5 years of
treatment;29,60
these effects are similar to those observed in
adult patients.28
Efficacy data have been confirmed by the
large number of pediatric patients (n = 166) enrolled in
the ESCALATOR study.24

pediatric population, significant decreases in mean LIC

Effect of deferasirox on labile plasma Iron
Excess iron in the blood saturates the iron-binding protein
transferrin leading to non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI)
in the plasma. The cellular uptake of NTBI is uncontrolled,
which can potentially lead to excessive accumulation of labile
iron in tissues such as the heart, liver and endocrine system.
This labile iron may be a key mediator of iron toxicity due to
its ability to catalyze production of reactive oxygen species.62
Control of labile plasma iron (LPI) is therefore an impor-
tant aim of chelation therapy. In the ESCALATOR study in
patients with β-thalassemia, LPI levels were analyzed using
an assay that measured iron-specific redox cycling capacity
in the presence of low ascorbate concentrations.63
Redox
reactions were detected by the oxidation of a fluorogenic
probe to its fluorescent form, which allowed distinction
of chelator-bound from chelator-free LPI. Data from this
study demonstrated that daily trough levels of deferasirox
are sufficient to maintain suppression of LPI (Figure 5).64
After 4 weeks of treatment and throughout the remainder
of the 1-year treatment period, peak LPI levels observed
just before deferasirox dosing were significantly decreased
compared with baseline and remained within normal values.
Similar sustained reductions in LPI with deferasirox have
been observed in other disease cohorts, including MDS and
AA.46,65,66
These findings support the concept that once-daily
deferasirox therapy may decrease unregulated tissue iron
loading and prevent further end-organ damage across various
transfusion-dependent anemias.
Safety and tolerability of deferasirox
Deferasirox has a well characterized and manageable safety
profile in adult and pediatric patients as young as 2 years
with various transfusion-dependent anemias.20–23
Most
patients remain on deferasirox therapy and adverse events
are not a common reason for study discontinuation; eg, only
74 of 1000 patients enrolled in the core clinical studies
discontinued treatment with deferasirox due to the occur-
rence of adverse events.16,20–23
The most common drug-related
adverse events reported during deferasirox treatment include
transient, mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal disturbances
(such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea)
and skin rash; these events generally resolved spontaneously.
For severe skin rash deferasirox should be interrupted until
the rash has resolved; reintroduction at a lower dose with
subsequent gradual escalation may then be considered in
combination with a short period of oral steroid administration.
Mild, non-progressive increases in serum creatinine, gener-
ally within the upper limit of normal (ULN), were observed
in approximately one-third of patients in the pivotal 1-year
clinical trials.16,20–23
Serum creatinine levels spontaneously
returned to baseline in approximately two-thirds of patients
who experienced these increases.67
There were no cases of
moderate-to-severe renal insufficiency or renal failure and no
patients permanently discontinued treatment due to creatinine
increases. If there is an increase in serum creatinine beyond
the age-appropriate ULN, deferasirox should be interrupted
until levels have returned to the normal range.Treatment may
then be restarted at a lower dose with gradual escalation. In the
1-year studies elevations of liver transaminases were reported
in about 2% of patients; these were not dependent on dose
and most patients had elevated baseline levels. Elevations
greater than 10 × ULN, suggestive of hepatitis, were
uncommon (0.3%).10
Following any unexplained, persistent,
or progressive increases in serum transaminases, deferasirox
treatment should be interrupted. Once the cause of the
transaminase increases has been established or when levels
have returned to normal, deferasirox may be restarted at a
lower dose followed by gradual escalation.
The tolerability and safety profile of deferasirox in
pediatric patients is similar to that observed in adults.29
As growth retardation and hypogonadism remain significant

clinical problems in pediatric patients with β-thalassemia, it is
important to note that growth and sexual development proceed
normally during deferasirox therapy.24,29
In the ESCALATOR
study, growth in pediatric patients was assessed based on
height standard deviation score (h-SDS).68
At baseline, both
boys and girls were initially smaller than the reference group
across all ages (2 to 6, 6 to 12 and 12 to 16 years).24
Over the 1-year study period, the observed growth as
evaluated by change from baseline in h-SDS showed growth
improvements (0.5 SDS) in 18.1% of patients, worsen-
ing in growth in 9.4% of patients, and no change from
baseline in 72.5% of patients. In this population, girls aged
12 to 16 years showed a notable improvement in growth,
with 66.7% of this cohort exhibiting a net increase in h-SDS
(25% percentile or first quartile = –0.06).24
Long-term safety of deferasirox
Safety data with deferasirox has now been reported for up
to 5 years of treatment (Table 3).28,60,69
Based on 472 patients
with β-thalassemia who received deferasirox for a median
of 4.5 years, 50 (10.6%) discontinued due to adverse events.
The types of drug-related adverse events reported in the
extension studies were similar to those reported in the initial
1-year treatment period, and the annual frequency generally
decreased from year to year, ranging from 0% to 2.3% in
years 2 to 5.28
In addition, there were no progressive increases
in serum creatinine over longer-term deferasirox treatment.28
The long-term safety profile of deferasirox in diseases other
than β‑thalassemia is also available. Deferasirox has a well
characterized and manageable safety profile in SCD patients
for up to 3.5 years of treatment and no progressive increases
in serum creatinine were observed, demonstrating a favorable
renal safety profile in these patients who are at risk of pro-
gressive renal disease.69
In MDS patients the most common
adverse events are gastrointestinal disturbances and skin rash,
similar to that observed with β-thalassemia patients.31
Drug interactions and post-marketing
surveillance
Deferasirox inhibits CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 in vitro, therefore
caution should be used when administering deferasirox with
drugs metabolized by these enzymes. Deferasirox also inhibits
CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19, however the
clinical significance of this is unknown. The concomitant
use of deferasirox with potent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
inducers (eg, rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir)
may result in a decrease in deferasirox efficacy. The
concomitant administration of deferasirox with other iron
chelators, aluminum-containing antacid preparations,
vitamin C or hydroxyurea has not been formally studied.
There have been post-marketing reports of cytopenias (both
spontaneous and from clinical trials) in patients treated
with deferasirox, although all of these patients had either
pre-existing hematologic disorders that are commonly
associated with bone-marrow failure or complications of
the underlying disease that are associated with cytopenias
(eg, hypersplenism, sickle cell crisis, administration of
chemotherapy). The relationship of these episodes to
treatment with deferasirox is uncertain. As with the standard

clinical management of such hematological disorders, blood
counts should be monitored regularly. Post-marketing cases of
acute renal failure, some with a fatal outcome, have also been
reported. Most of the fatalities occurred in patients with severe
complications related to the underlying disease (eg, patients
with multiple co-morbidities who were in advanced stages of
disease). It is therefore recommended that particular attention
is given to monitoring serum creatinine levels in patients who
have preexisting renal conditions, are elderly, have co-morbid
conditions that may affect renal function, or are receiving
medicinal products that depress renal function. There have
also been post-marketing reports of hepatic failure, some with
a fatal outcome, in patients treated with deferasirox. Most
of these events occurred in patients with significant comor-
bidities, including liver cirrhosis and multi-organ failure.
In addition, upper gastrointestinal ulceration and hemorrhage
have been reported in some patients, including children and
adolescents, receiving deferasirox. Physicians and patients
should remain alert for signs and symptoms of these events
and promptly initiate additional evaluation and treatment if a
serious gastrointestinal adverse event is suspected.
Safety at low iron burden and high
deferasirox doses
Maintaining serum ferritin levels below 1000 ng/mL is
known to be associated with a reduced risk of iron-overload-
related complications, such as heart failure, in patients with
thalassemia.5
However, as the use of DFO has been associated
with increased toxicity at low serum ferritin levels, it is of
interest to assess the adverse event profile of patients enrolled
in the deferasirox studies who achieved serum ferritin levels
of 1000 ng/mL.5,70,71
An analysis of 174 patients demon-
strated a similar safety profile to that observed in patients
who did not achieve serum ferritin levels of 1000 ng/mL
(n = 300).72
For example, the frequency of drug-related
adverse events such as nausea (14.9% vs 12.7%), vomiting
(8.0% vs 8.3%) and skin rash (5.2% vs 5.3%), were compa-
rable. In addition, similar proportions of patients experienced
increases in serum creatinine 33% above baseline and
ULN (14.9% vs 12.0%) and increases in ALT  10 × ULN
(6.9% vs 6.7%). These data suggest that when appropriately
dosed, serum ferritin can be maintained at levels lower than
1000 ng/mL during deferasirox treatment without increases
in the frequency or type of adverse event reported.73
Data from patients who have received deferasirox doses
of 30 mg/kg/day demonstrate that the safety profile is
consistent with that observed at doses of 30 mg/kg/day.35
The most common drug-related adverse events were gastro-
intestinal events such as vomiting (n = 7, 3.1%), abdominal
pain and nausea (n = 4, 1.8% for both).35

the route of administration has an impact on compliance.
Due to the need for 8- to 12-hour infusions, 5 to 7 times per
week, compliance with DFO is suboptimal, ranging from
59% to 78%.6
Poor compliance with treatment can lead to
serious morbidities and have a significant impact on cost, for
example complications of iron overload such as heart disease
or diabetes may increase annual costs by US$40,000.75
As
deferasirox is a once-daily oral treatment, improvements
in compliance compared with DFO may lead to improved
patient outcomes and lower treatment costs.These have been
evaluated in a number of analyses.
Cost effectiveness of deferasirox
Two separate studies have compared the cost-effectiveness
of DFO and deferasirox.76,77
In a US model, treatment with
deferasirox resulted in an additional 4.5 quality adjusted life
years (QALYs) per patient at an additional lifetime cost of
US$126,018 per patient, translating into a cost-effectiveness
ratio of US$28,255 per QALY gained.76
Deferasirox was also
associated with lower net costs and higher QALYs than DFO
in a UK-based model.77
In this analysis drug dose and cost was
relayed to patient weight; for patients with a mean weight of
62 kg the incremental cost per QALY gained was £7775.77
Effect of deferasirox on patient-reported
outcomes
A number of deferasirox studies have evaluated
patient-reported satisfaction, convenience and treatment
preference, which may provide surrogate measures for
treatment compliance, in patients with β-thalassemia,
SCD and MDS.78–81
In one study, 97% of patients with
β-thalassemia who switched from DFO to deferasirox
reported that they preferred deferasirox to DFO, primarily
due to convenience (37%), no injection-site soreness (25%)
and less daily disruption (23%).78
Most patients were
more satisfied with deferasirox therapy and found it to be
more convenient than DFO (Figure 6).78
Similarly, another
study found that 91% of 252 patients with β‑thalassemia
were ‘satisfied/very satisfied’ with treatment after 1 year
compared with 23% at baseline (all patients had received
DFO and/or deferiprone prior to initiation of deferasirox).80
Time lost for normal activities due to chelation therapy
was substantially reduced with deferasirox treatment com-
pared with prior treatments (from 28.8 hours/month at
baseline to 3.0 hours/month after 1 year).80
Similar results
have been observed in patients with SCD.81
Improvements
in health-related quality of life, based on SF-36 domain
scores (eg, physical functioning and general health), were
observed during 1 year of deferasirox treatment in patients
with β-thalassemia (n = 274), MDS (n = 168) and SCD
(n = 50) who were enrolled in the EPIC study.82
Conclusions and place in therapy
This article demonstrates the efficacy and safety profile of the
oral iron chelator deferasirox, which has specific advantages
over the other available chelators due to its formulation and
route of administration. The large clinical development pro-
gram including patients with various underlying anemias has
demonstrated the ability of deferasirox to remove iron from
the liver and heart. The efficacy of deferasirox is dependent
on appropriate dosing according to current iron burden,
ongoing transfusional iron intake and safety markers,27,30
and
regular monitoring of these parameters is necessary to ensure
dose adjustments are made in a timely manner.10
Recent data
from a substudy of EPIC have confirmed the findings of
previous smaller studies demonstrating that deferasirox can
remove cardiac iron and maintain cardiac function based on
LVEF.39,41,42
Data from this substudy also show that deferasirox

can prevent the accumulation of cardiac iron, highlighting the
importance of early intervention to aid in the prevention of
future cardiac events resulting from myocardial siderosis.83–85
Data from several studies of up to 5 years’ duration provide
support for the long-term efficacy of deferasirox in main-
taining or reducing overall iron burden across a range of
anemias.28,55
Deferasirox is well tolerated with a manageable
safety profile over long-term treatment in both pediatric and
adult patients. The frequency of treatment-related adverse
events generally decreases over time; the most common
adverse events reported are mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal
disorders and skin rash.28,29,35
The safety profile is similar at
doses above and below 30 mg/kg/day and at serum ferritin
levels above and below 1000 ng/mL.72
Improved satisfaction
with, and convenience of, deferasirox compared with DFO
has also been shown,78–81
which may translate into improved
compliance and subsequent cost savings. In conclusion,
once-daily oral therapy with deferasirox provides a significant
development in the treatment of iron overload in patients with
transfusion-dependent anemias.
