Abstract
Background: To examine the type, frequency, severity, and predictors of anemia and its
relationship with co-morbid conditions among institutionalized people with intellectual and/or
motor disability.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study at a public facility for people with intellectual and/
or motor disability in Ibaraki prefecture, Japan. Health checkup data obtained in 2001 from 477
people with intellectual disability (male: 286, average age 40.6 ± 12.3; female: 191, average age 45.1
± 11.6) were retrospectively reviewed.
Results: The prevalence of anemia among male participants was higher than in female participants
for each disability category (intellectual disability, 41.1%, 4.2%; cerebral palsy, 37.5%, 4.8%; Down's
syndrome, 15.0%, 0%; severe motor and intellectual disabilities, 61.9%, 16.7%). Most participants
with anemia (93.8 – 100%) showed a normocytic normochromic anemia pattern. Multivariate
analysis revealed that factors related to an increase in frequency included sex (male), low body mass
index (BMI), use of anticonvulsants or major tranquilizers, and a high zinc sulfate turbidity test
(ZTT) value. No clinically diagnosed co-morbid condition was found to be related to the presence
of anemia.
Conclusion: A high frequency of mild normocytic normochromic anemia in institutionalized
people with intellectual and/or motor disability was observed, particularly among males.
Medications and chronic inflammation may increase the risk of anemia.
Background
The 1992 American Association on Mental Retardation's
(AAMR) definition and classification of mental retarda-
tion differs from the previous classification system in that:
(a) a single diagnostic code of mental retardation is used
if the individual meets the three criteria of age of onset (18

or under), significantly sub-average abilities in intellectual
functioning, and related limitations in two or more adap-
tive skills areas; (b) the individual's strengths and weak-
nesses are described in reference to four dimensions:
intellectual functioning and adaptive skills; psychological
and emotional well-being; health, physical well-being,
and etiology; and life activity environments; and (c) a pro-
file of required support is developed across the four
dimensions [1].
In recent years, interest in the quality of life of persons
with intellectual disability has grown. However, epidemi-
ological research on health and illness among people with
intellectual disability has lagged when compared to simi-
lar research on healthy individuals.
Many persons with intellectual disability in Japan lead a
collective lifestyle at a public facility as a community.
These facilities provide an adequate diet, occupational
rehabilitation and periodic medical checkups [2] and are
thus fairly accommodable to conducting epidemiologic
research on people with intellectual disability. In the past,
nutritionists at these facilities have recognized a high fre-
quency of anemia among institutionalized people with
intellectual disability. Nevertheless, there continues to be
a lack of epidemiological studies on the actual frequency,
pattern, and predictors of anemia. The accumulation of
relevant findings on this subject is strongly required. To
this end, we conducted a cross-sectional study examining
the type, frequency, severity, and predictors of anemia and
its relationship with co-morbid conditions among institu-
tionalized people with intellectual disability using blood
profile tests conducted periodically at the facility.
Methods
Participants in the present study consisted of 315 people
with intellectual disability (male: 197, average age 40.3 ±
14.0; female: 118, average age 47.1 ± 11.4), 90 people
with cerebral palsy (male: 48, average age 42.1 ± 10.7,
female: 42, average age 43.0 ± 11.8), 33 people with
Down syndrome (male: 20, average age 42.1 ± 9.5,
female: 13, average age 47.5 ± 6.1), and 39 people with
severe motor and intellectual disabilities (male: 21, aver-
age age 38.5 ± 10.6, female: 18, average age 35.2 ± 9.9)
from a population of 477 persons with intellectual disa-
bility (male: 286, average age 40.0 ± 14.0; female: 191,
average age 46.8 ± 11.6) institutionalized at a public facil-
ity in Ibaraki prefecture (109 km north of Tokyo, with a
population of approximately 3 million), Japan. As of
2001, a total of 12,600 people in Ibaraki prefecture were
recognized as intellectually disabled. This public facility
houses more severely disabled persons. Over 95% of the
residents were judged as having a severe level of intellec-
tual disability. The subjects in the present examination
were not diagnosed according to the AAMR's criteria;
however, upon admission to the facility, subjects were
diagnosed according to criteria similar to that of the
AAMR, namely, the criteria of intelligence quotient (IQ),
activities of daily life (ADL) and adaptive skills.
In Japan, periodical health checkups are provided for indi-
viduals in order to prevent lifestyle-related diseases
including circulatory diseases. Recommended tests have
been indicated for various health screenings. The present
study retrospectively analyzed the existing health checkup
data for each resident. The following information was col-
lected at periodical health checkups administered in
2001: blood biochemical examinations, blood pressure,
main disability, main diagnosis, IQs, and information
regarding medications. The modified Binet Test for Japa-
nese was used to calculate IQ at admission. According to
the reference values of the institution, the definition of
anemia was a hemoglobin (Hb) value ≤ 13.4 g/dl for
males and ≤ 11.2 g/dl for females.
Patterns of anemia were classified with mean cellular vol-
ume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concen-
tration (MCHC). Characteristics of anemic (normocytic
normochromic anemia and anemia except normocytic
normochromic anemia) and non-anemic individuals
were analyzed separately. Multiple regression and logistic
regression analyses using anemia as a dependent variable
and c-reactive protein (CRP) and the zinc sulfate turbidity
test (ZTT) as indices of inflammation estimated the fol-
lowing predictors of anemia: sex, age, body mass index
(BMI), and the use of anticonvulsants and/or major tran-
quilizers, minor tranquilizers, iron replacement, or other
medications (i.e. gastrointestinal drugs, drugs for a com-
mon cold, cardiovascular medication). ZTT is a turbidity
test in which reagents are added to serum samples, and
ZTT findings reflect the level of γ-globulins, in particular
IgG.
Multivariate analysis was conducted using only three cat-
egories of people with intellectual disability. As the char-
acteristics of people with severe motor and intellectual
disability were very different from those of the other cate-
gories, the groups of patients with cerebral palsy and
Down syndrome were combined. Assuming people with
intellectual disability as a criterion, two dummy variables
(G1 and G2) were used to express the influence of the
groups of patients with cerebral palsy and Down syn-
drome on the presence of anemia (G1 and G2 = 0 for peo-
ple with intellectual disability; G1 = 1, G2 = 0 for people
with cerebral palsy; G1 = 0, G2 = 1 for people with Down
syndrome). We reviewed the medical charts of each resi-
dent to gather information regarding physical conditions
that can cause secondary anemia, such as thyroid dysfunc-
tion, hepatopathy, nephropathy, and gastrointestinal dis-
ease. Tests were not performed on all residents, but were

performed on individuals for whom such tests were clini-
cally required. The presence or absence of any of these dis-
eases was taken into multivariate analysis in order to
assess its relationship with anemia.
Furthermore, five men and five women were selected
according to their Hb levels (the lowest) and were exam-
ined for their clinical characteristics. According to the
reports from the registered dieticians at the institution,
who determined the target food intake for each resident,
all residents ate most of the foods that were prepared for
them and primarily satisfied the target intake. Thus, the
amount of food provided to each resident predominantly
satisfies the Sixth Revised Japanese Nutritional Require-
ments.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS®
ver.12.0 statistical software (SPSS. Inc. Chicago, Illinois).
Significance was established at the P = 0.05 level. The
research protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Miyagi Gakuin Women's University,
which the first author (HO) was affiliated with at the time
this study was conducted.
Results
Severity of intellectual disability in mental retardation was
defined as follows. Mild: IQ level 50–55 to approximately
70; moderate: IQ level 35–40 to approximately 50–55;
severe: IQ level 20–25 to approximately 35–40; profound:
IQ level below 20–25; and severity unspecified (when
intellectual disability is strongly suggested but intelligence
can not be tested by a standardized test) [3].
In Japan, public facilities house a larger ratio of individu-
als with severe intellectual disability than private facilities
or individual residences. This was also true in our study.
In most cases, subjects were institutionalized not on their
will but rather as the result of an agreement between their
guardian and the local government. The majority of par-
ticipants obtained special education or did not receive any
schooling due to their intellectual disability. Underlying
diseases were unclear in the majority of cases. While diag-
noses included cretinism, microencephaly, Sturge-Weber
syndrome, fragile X syndrome, autism, tuberous sclerosis,
Prader-Willi syndrome, and seizure, no trend towards a
certain diagnosis was observed. Although a specific medi-
cal cause was not identified, in light of the dearth of epi-
demiological studies using large samples of people with
intellectual disability institutionalized at the same facility,
these findings provide valuable insight into the health of
people with intellectual disability in Japan.
Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 show the characteristics of 315 institu-
tionalized people with intellectual disability, 90 with cer-
ebral palsy, 33 with Down syndrome, and 39 with severe
motor and intellectual disabilities. Average BMI (kg/m2)
was 21.5/22.0 (male/female) for people with intellectual
disability; 20.7/21.6 for people with cerebral palsy; 22.2/
24.0 for people with Down syndrome; and 14.3/15.1 for
people with severe motor and intellectual disabilities.

(4.8%) were anemic. Among people with Down syn-
drome, 3 males (15.0%) and 0 females (0%) were anemic.
Among people with severe motor and intellectual disabil-
ities, anemia was identified in 13 males (61.9%) and 3
females (16.7%). The highest rate (143 people) of medi-
cation use was observed for males with intellectual disa-
bility. Nine (4.6%) males with intellectual disability took
an iron replacement.
Tables 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 show the characteristics of anemic and
non-anemic persons, including 314 institutionalized peo-
ple with intellectual disability, 90 with cerebral palsy, 33
with Down syndrome, and 39 with severe motor and
intellectual disabilities. Among anemic persons, 80 with
intellectual disability (94.1%), 19 with cerebral palsy
(100%), 3 with Down syndrome (100%), and 15 with
severe motor and intellectual disabilities (93.8%) showed
a normocytic normochromic anemia pattern. Average Fe
levels of anemic people were lower than those of non-ane-
mic people for all categories. Among people with intellec-
tual disability, the level of Fe was within the normal range
for 270 of the 314 people (86.0%) and was below the nor-
mal range for 44 of the 314 people (14.0%). Medication
was more common in anemic people than in non-anemic
people.
Estimates for predictors of anemia are shown in Table 9.
Factors related to a decrease in frequency of anemia were
a high BMI value and a diagnosis of Down syndrome,
while factors related to an increase included sex (male),
use of anticonvulsants or major tranquilizer, and a high
ZTT value.
Table 10 shows conditions co-morbid with anemia and
non-anemia cases among 477 institutionalized people
with intellectual and/or motor disability. The most preva-
lent co-morbid conditions were gastro-intestinal disease
(7.1%) followed by thyroid dysfunction (6.7%). When
taking the presence of co-morbid conditions as explana-
tory variables in multiple regression or logistic regression
analyses, no relationship with anemia was detected.
In case examinations of people whose Hb levels were the
lowest among all subjects, the range of Hb was 9.4–10.7
g/dl for males and 9.8–10.6 g/dl for females. Routine
health checkups did not identify any other unusual find-
ings.

Discussion
The findings of the present research indicated a high fre-
quency of mild normocytic normochromic anemia
among institutionalized people with intellectual and/or
motor disability. Furthermore, the authors unexpectedly
observed that anemia was much more prevalent in males
than in females. This study also found that mild to mod-
erate anemia occurred without a decrease in white blood
cell count. In terms of subjective symptoms, it is difficult
to determine the clinical importance of the anemia
observed in the present study because the participants
have intellectual and/or motor disability. However, Hb
level has been widely accepted as an important index of
nutritional status; therefore, it is of value to investigate the
relationship between the anemia observed in the present
research and the life prognosis of the participants.
To our knowledge, only a few case reports have discussed
Down syndrome in investigations of anemia among peo-
ple with intellectual disability [4,5]. As the literature on
this epidemiological aspect is very limited, we expect that
the present study will prompt similar studies in this field.
We tested for the possibility of diet-induced anemia by
observing the intake of periodic balanced meals [6]; how-
ever, this explanation did not appear to be plausible. In
Japan, research on dietary assessment of people with intel-
lectual and/or motor disability has just begun [2,6]; there-
fore, no reference data for the nutritional intake of people
with intellectual and/or motor disability is available.
Among sample sizes large enough for multivariate analy-
sis, results similar to those obtained in the analysis of the
three combined categories (people with intellectual disa-
bility, cerebral palsy, and Down syndrome) were
observed. For the other categories, the results obtained
from multivariate analyses were not reliable due to small
sample sizes.
The results of this cross-sectional study on predictors of
anemia identified that a low BMI value, use of anticonvul-
sants and/or major tranquilizers, a high ZTT values and
category of intellectual disability were predictors of an
increased risk of anemia. However, the reason why ane-
mia was more prevalent in males than in females remains
unclear. A possible reason for this may be the reference
values that were employed in the present study. The stand-
ard Hb value for anemia proposed by the WHO is <13.0
g/dl for males and <12.0 g/dl for females [7]. According to
Table 9: Predictors of anemia among 438a institutionalized people with intellectual and/or motor disability, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan.

these standard values, the frequency of anemia was 26.2%
for males and 19.5% for females with intellectual disabil-
ity; 25.0% for males and 33.3% for females with cerebral
palsy; 10.0% for males and 0% for females with Down
syndrome; and 52.4% for males and 33.3% for females
with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. Logistic
regression analysis showed no correlation between sex
and anemia, and the p value for ZTT became 0.11; how-
ever, no changes were observed for the other explanatory
variables.
In a real clinical setting, the standard values proposed by
the WHO are not the only available reference values. Indi-
vidual facilities and standard textbooks provide a diverse
range of reference values [8-10]. Therefore, in considera-
tion of the unique characteristics of the participants in the
present study, in order to determine the presence of ane-
mia, we adopted the reference value of the facility where
the study was conducted.
As BMI is an indicator of nutritional state, it has been
found to be related with anemia [11]. In regards to medi-
cation, anemic subjects in the present study were likely to
be taking carbamazepine (n = 25), valproic acid (n = 20),
or levomepromazine (n = 14). Though previous studies
have found that aplastic anemia is an adverse side effect of
anticonvulsants (i.e. carbamazepine, Aethosuximide, fel-
bamate, levetiracetam) and that thrombocytopenia is an
adverse outcome of valproic acid, no studies have
reported an association with anemia as observed in the
present study [12,13].
However, one case report has described a possible rela-
tionship between hypoplastic anemia and chlorpro-
mazine with a correlation to levomepromazine [14]. Sixty
patients receiving long-term valproate (VPA) mono-
therapy were studied for hematologic side effects. Twenty
developed at least one prominent hematologic abnormal-
ity. Thrombocytopenia and macrocytosis were the most
common findings. Hematologic toxicity was never severe
enough to discontinue therapy and always responded to
small decrements in VPA therapy [15]. Our present study
epidemiologically suggests that risk of anemia is related to
medication. Nevertheless, given that data on medications
were collected from medical records, this study is limited
to an assessment of only currently prescribed medica-
tions. Accordingly, the duration of time medications were
taken and whether subjects had to discontinue their med-
ications for a period of time could not be considered.
Limitations in design also exist. As this study was cross-
sectional, we can not deny the possibility that some indi-
viduals may stop their medication due to anemia. Judging
from experience at this facility, however, medication regi-
men is not influenced by the onset of anemia. Accord-
ingly, the present findings can not be used as an
evaluation of risk. However, these findings did show a
relation between the use of anticonvulsants and/or major
tranquilizers and anemia with a limited possibility of
severe anemia.
Given that a high ZTT value reflects IgG levels, the present
findings suggest the possibility that chronic inflammation
exists as an underlying factor. Chronic inflammation is
well known to be a cause of normocytic normochromic
anemia [16,17]. Given that CRP fluctuates even over short
periods of time, inflammation observed with a high CRP
value does not necessarily indicate that the inflammation

is chronic. As the correlation between CRP and ZTT was
weak (R = 0.12, P = 0.02), if chronic inflammation is
indeed a cause of increased frequency of anemia among
institutionalized persons, further studies assessing this
possibility are required.
The examination of co-morbidity in the present study may
indicate a relationship with chronic inflammation; how-
ever, no relationships were observed between co-morbid
conditions and the presence of anemia. Another possible
co-morbid condition could be the presence of periodontal
disease and caries caused by poor oral hygiene; however,
specific categories were not included in evaluations used
at periodical health checkups. Therefore, we are currently
analyzing data in reference to results obtained from dental
health checkups.
Anemia may reflect many conditions such as gastrointes-
tinal blood loss (these institutionalized residents would
almost certainly be at high risk of Helicobacter pylori
infection), gastroesophageal reflux (especially for those
with severe disability), nutritional deficiencies, or chronic
disease. However, data obtained from the medical records
for the present analysis was limited to gastroesophageal
reflux disease, gastro-intestinal disease, thyroid dysfunc-
tion, tonsillitis, liver disease, renal disease, parathyroid
dysfunction, and sinusitis. Furthermore, diagnosis of
these diseases was not standardized because of the nature
of retrospective review. At least in the present study, as
ascertained from medical charts, no clear correlation was
observed between anemia and chronic diseases. The
objective of the present study was to ascertain the fre-
quency, severity, and predictors of anemia, not to clarify
the cause of anemia; thus, further inquiry into the cause of
anemia is beyond the scope of the present study.
When examining causes of anemia by MCV, low mean
corpuscular volume implies the possibility of iron defi-
ciency anemia, thalassemic disorders, anemia of chronic
disease, sideroblastic anemia, copper deficiency, or zinc
poisoning. Normal mean corpuscular volume implies the
possibility of acute blood loss, iron deficiency anemia,
anemia of chronic disease (eg, infection, inflammation,
malignancy), bone marrow suppression, chronic renal
insufficiency, or endocrine dysfunction (hypothyroidism,
hypopituitarism). Increased mean corpuscular volume
implies the possibility of valproic acid consumption, eth-
anol abuse, folic acid deficiency, myelodsplastic syn-
dromes, acute myeloid leukemias, reticulocytosis, drug-
induced anemia, or liver disease [15,18]. In the present
study, 93.8–100% of anemia observed among people
with intellectual and/or motor disability showed a nor-
mocytic normochromic anemia pattern. As multivariate
analyses showed that high ZTT levels were associated with
Hb levels or the presence of anemia, the anemia that was
frequently observed in this study may be due to underly-
ing chronic inflammation. Multivariate analyses were
conducted after excluding people who were suspected of
having iron deficiency anemia based on anemia patterns;
however, the results were the same when these individuals
were included. The results of multivariate analyses that
did not include people who were suspected of having iron
deficiency anemia also confirmed a correlation with ZTT.
This study highlights that medications and chronic
inflammation should be considered in the evaluation of
anemia among institutionalized people with intellectual
and/or motor disability. The present study reviewed med-
ical charts at one facility retrospectively; thus there are
limitations in the generalization of the study results.
Regarding the selection of the study population, random
sampling of facilities across Japan is preferable. If national
random sampling is not possible, it is necessary to accu-
mulate data from other facilities or conduct multicenter
studies. As epidemiological research on people with intel-
lectual and/or motor disability is still in the developmen-
tal stage, further epidemiological research is needed on
other health problems faced by people with intellectual
and/or motor disability.
Conclusion
A high frequency of mild normocytic normochromic ane-
mia in institutionalized people with intellectual and/or
motor disability was observed, particularly among males.
Medications and chronic inflammation may increase the
risk of anemia.
