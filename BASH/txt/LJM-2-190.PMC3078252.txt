Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have elicited a great clinical interest, particularly in the areas of
regenerative medicine and induction of tolerance in allogeneic transplantation. Previous reports demonstrated
the feasibility of transplanting MSCs, which generates new prospects in cellular therapy. Recently, injection
of MSCs induced remission of steroid-resistant acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This review
summarizes the knowledge and possible future clinical uses of MSCs.

Introduction
Isolation of bone marrow (BM) cells that could
form new bone when transplanted to an ectopic
site was demonstrated using the guinea pig model
[1,2]. These derived stromal cells, named
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), were expanded
from adherent stromal cells in bone marrow
culture. The results were confirmed later in both
rabbit and rat bone marrow cells [2-4].
MSCs are adult clonal multipotential stem cells
localized in the medullary stroma [5-7]. The human
body contains many stem cells, i.e. hematopoietic
(HSC) [8], neural [9], epithelial [10,11] and
embryonic stem cells [12]. MSCs do not fulfill all
true stem cell criteria. In contrast to HSC, single
MSCs cannot regenerate a whole tissue
compartment, and they do not have indefinite self
renewal capacity.
MSC cells represent 1/10,000 to 1/100,000 of all
mononuclear cells in the BM, and they can be
expanded 500-fold through as many as 50
generations to produce billions of cells [13-16].
Colonies derived from a single MSC vary to some
extent in differentiation capacity and expansion
potential [17-20]. Entry of MSC into senescence is
almost undetectable, and they lose their stem cell
characteristics and differentiation potential from
the sixth passage onwards [21].
Haynesworth et al developed a reliable in vivo
bone-forming assay and were able to isolate and
expand human MSCs for therapeutic purposes
[22].
The ability to expand MSCs in vitro for clinical
applications has recently facilitated the
development of clinical trials designed to assess
the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of transplanting
MSCs for a variety of diseases [14]. Neither
toxicity nor malignancy was associated with
infusion of expanded autologus MSCs into patients
with advanced breast cancer, with Hurler
syndrome, or with metachromatic leukodystrophy
[23-25].
In this review we will discuss the following:
1- Characterstics of MSCs
2- MSCs isolation and culture expansion
3- Transplantibility and engrafment of MSCs
4- Role of MSCs in support of hematopoiesis
5- MSCs plasticity, differentiation, possible uses
in regenerative medicine and treatment of
various diseases
6- Role of MSCs in immunomodulation
7- MSCs and solid organ graft
8- Role of MSCs in irradiation injuries or burns
9- MSCs in gene therapy
10- MSCs in cancer
Characteristics of MSCs
MSCs are unspecialized cells that lack tissue-
specific characteristics and can maintain their
undifferentiated phenotype. Under the influence of
specific biological signals, MSCs can differentiate
into specialized cells with a phenotype that is
fully distinct from that of the precursor.
MSCs express neither the hematopoietic
markers CD34, CD45, CD14, CD11 (7,26), nor the
co-stimulatory molecules CD 80, CD 86, CD40,
CD 40 ligand and CD 154 (27). MSCs are positive
for CD73, CD105 and CD90 (28). MSCs express
adhesion molecules, including VCAM (CD 106),
ICAM (CD54), and LFA-3 (29). It has been
demonstrated that human MSC MHC (HLA-DR) is
localized in the submembranous space near the
nucleolus (30), but cell surface expression of class
I and class II MHC requires activation by
interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (27, 31).
MSCs secrete respectively Interleukin-6 (IL-6),
IL-7, IL-11, IL-12, IL-14, IL-15, leukemia inhibitory
factor (LIF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(M-CSF), stem cell factor (SCF), and flt-3 ligand
[32].
Minimal criteria for defining multipotent
mesenchymal stromal cells according to the
International Society for Cellular Therapy are the
ability to regenerate and differentiate into tissues
of mesodermal origin (osteocytes, adipocytes and
chondrocytes), and the absence of expression of
haemopoietic molecules [28].
MSC isolation and culture expansion
MSCs have been isolated from adipose tissue,
fetal liver, blood, lung, postnatal marrow, cord
blood, brain, spleen, kidney, bone marrow,
Page 190

muscle, thymus, pancreas, and from human
peripheral blood mobilized with Granulocyte-
Colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) [33-36].
However, long-term cultures of MSCs can be
generated only from blood vessels [37].
Human MSCs are isolated from the total
nucleated cell population in a BM aspirate, which
is often harvested from the superior iliac crest of
the pelvis, after separation by discontinuous
density gradient centrifugation [6,38,39].
Mononuclear cells (MNC) are then cultured in a
medium, such as Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM), or alpha MEM (α-MEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS),
platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or a commercial
substitute of human serum [15,40,41].
In culture, the non-adherent MNC are washed
away to leave behind small, adherent fibroblast-
like cells. Cultures have an initial lag phase of
three to five days [42], followed by rapid
proliferation with an average initial doubling time
ranging from 12 to 24 h and varying from one
donor to another [15]. MSCs have a spindle shape
(Figure1), and they can be expanded for about
three weeks. At confluence, MSCs enter a
stationary phase [15]. They are then detached by
trypsinization and subcultured for many passages,
giving long-term cultures. Using this method,
comparable and reproducible populations of MSCs
have been generated in many laboratories
[4,7,26,37].
Figure 1: Mesenchymal stem cells in culture.
Transplantability and engraftment of MSCs.
Numerous studies have demonstrated migration
and multiorgan engraftment of MSCs both in
animal models and in human clinical trials [43-48].
Direct injection of human marrow stromal cells
into the corpus striatum of rat brain showed
engraftment of 20% of the infused cells [48].
Injection of MSCs into the lateral ventricle of
neonatal mice migrated throughout the forebrain
and cerebellum [44]. Rat bone marrow stromal
cells infused distally into areas of occluded
ascending aorta migrated after eight weeks into
the scar and periscar tissue [47].
MSCs injected intravenously into irradiated
primates could engraft in different injured tissues,
such as bone marrow, skin, digestive tract, and
muscle [49,50]. MSCs infused into mice homed
into thymus [46].
In rat models, rat MSC have been engrafted in
multiple organs, such as lung, liver, kidney and
spleen. However, homing of labeled MSCs to the
marrow of long bones was significantly increased
by pre-treatment with vasodilators [51].
Human MSCs engrafted into sheep [52,53] or
mouse [54-56] show site-specific differentiation.
The ability of MSC to engraft was influenced
neither by the route of adminstration nor by the
difference in conditioning protocols [57].
Both autologous and allogeneic MSCs have
been given to patients [25,58,59]. Allogeneic
HLA-mismatched male foetal cells injected into
HLA-incompatible female fetal cells with
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) engrafted and
differentiated into bone [60]. Haploidentical MSCs
had a low level of engraftment in a patient with
aplastic anemia, but there was a partial restoration
of the bone marrow microenvironment [61]. In
contrast, infused allogeneic MSCs did not expand
substantially in patients. [59,62].
Role of MSCs in support of hematopoiesis
MSCs support medullary hematopoiesis
structurally and functionally by providing growth
factors and extracellular matrix [63-67, 42].
Co-transplantation of HSCs along with MSCs
ameliorated hematopoietic reconstitution
[25,68,69]. MSCs maintain the expansion of
lineage, specific colony-forming units of marrow
CD34+ HSC. MSCs enhance engraftment of dose
limited allogeneic and umbilical cord-derived HSC
in NOD/SCID and in fetal sheep [70-72]. This
promoting effect of MSCs was present even
though MSCs were not detected in the BM of the
host [73].
Co-transplantation of human MSCs enhances
human myelopoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis in
NOD/SCID mice [72] and increases the functional
hematopoietic microenvironment [74]. In humans,
rapid hematopoietic recovery was demonstrated
after co-infusion of autologous-blood stem cells
and culture-expanded MSCs in advanced breast
cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy
[23].

Co-transplantation of HLA-identical (sibling)
culture-expanded MSCs with an HLA-identical
(sibling) HSC transplant induced hematopoietic
recovery on peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNC)
and platelets [24,75].
MSC plasticity, differentiation, and
prospective use in regenerative medicine and
treatment of various diseases
Human MSCs are multipotent and easily
expanded. They represent potential clinical tools
for tissue repair and gene therapy.
MSCs have a plastic potential. Plasticity means
the ability of cells to convert from one type to
another, which is also known as horizontal
progression (synonomous to differentiation). In
vitro and in vivo studies have indicated the ability
of MSCs to differentiate into muscle, neural
precursors, myocardial tissues, cardiomyocytes,
bone, tendon, cartilage, and possibly other cell
types (Figure 2). MSCs also produce appreciable
amounts of lysosomal enzyme activity, which could
correct metabolic derangements when given to
enzyme-deficient patients with lysosomal storage
diseases and other neurometabolic illnesses [76].
Here we will outline briefly the results of several
studies demonstrating the ability of MSC to
differentiate into different tissues.
Muscle and heart
Repeated endomyocardial transplantation of
high doses of allogeneic MSCs appeared safe in
Yorkshire swine models [77]. Adult human MSCs
showed persistent engraftment into infarcted rat
myocardium [78]. MSCs enhanced the survival of
existing myocytes in mice through paracrine
mechanisms [79]. In murine models, single
clonally purified MSCs seem to be more beneficial
than unpurified transplantated MSCs in cardiac
repair [80].
Transplantation of MSC combined with
treatment with erythropoietin in rat models of acute
myocardial infarction leads to enhancement of
capillary density, and reduction of infarct size and
fibrotic areas, as compared to groups that received
only MSCs [81]. Transplantation of genetically
engineered MSCs expressing an anti-apoptotic
and angiogenic peptide improved cardiac function
after myocardial infarction significantly more than
MSCs alone [82]. MSCs implanted in a rat
myocardial infarct heart improved cardiac structure
and function through the combined effect of
myogenesis and angiogenesis [83]. Fischer rats
transplanted with MSCs transduced with an
adenovirus expressing the Ang-1 and Akt genes
were more resistant to anoxia and restored global
cardiac function [84]. However, MSC proliferation
in vitro was inhibited by aspirin, which is used
extensively to treat cardiovascular diseases [85].
MSCs can differentiate into smooth muscles in
rat models [86] and skeletal muscles in rat and
mouse models, respectively [87,88]. Human fetal
MSCs transplanted into the uterus of mice with
Duchenne muscular dystrophy distributed widely
and differentiated into muscle cells. However, this
did not cure the disease [89].
Nervous and renal system
Implantation of MSCs into injured spinal cords of
rhesus monkeys elicited de novo neurogenesis
and promoted functional recovery, as determined
by tests of cortical somatosensory-evoked
potential (CSEP) and motor-evoked potential
(MEP). This also led to nearly normal sensory
responses three months after transplantation [90].
Following spinal cord injury (SCI), MSCs had a
positive effect on behavioural outcomes and
histopathological assessments. They induced
better recovery of hind limb sensitivity and
increased the spared white matter in rat models
[91]. In mice, transdifferentiated MSCs implanted
into devitalised muscle grafts could support
peripheral nerve regeneration to some extent [92].
Intrastriatal transplantation of MSCs promoted
functional improvement on the rotarod test in
murine models of Parkinson's disease [93].
Addition of MSCs to degenerative disc cells with
anulus fibrosis (AF) in vitro resulted in changes in
extracellular matrix biosynthesis with an up-
regulation of proteoglycan synthesis [94].
In murine models of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis, administration of MSCs at
onset and at the peak of disease decreased
inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination in the
central nervous system [95]. In rhesus monkeys,
implantation of a cellular allogenic nerve grafts
and autologous MSCs repaired extended
peripheral nerve lesions [96].
In humans, MSCs transdifferentiated into neural
stem cells and improved the electrical and
functional recovery of two patients with chronic
spinal injury [97]. MSC infusion into patients
suffering from metachromatic leukodystrophy and
Hurler Syndrome was associated with significant
improvement in nerve conduction velocities [25].
Transplanted MSCs accelerated glomerular
healing in experimental rat models with
glomerulonephritis [98]. In mice, MSCs reduced
interstitial fibrosis, but did not delay progression of
chronic kidney disease [99]. MSCs may protect
against acute renal injury and promote the
recovery of morphological and functional
alterations of tubular epithelial cells [54]. In murine
Page 192

models, MSCs improved tissue damage triggered
by renal ischemia and reperfusion injury [100].
Skin and related tissue
Human MSCs derived from the early human
embryo can transform into epidermal cells in vitro
and in vivo [101]. Injection of autologous biograft
composed of autologous skin fibroblasts on
biodegradable collagen membrane (Coladerm) in
combination with autologous MSCs into the edges
of the wound decreased wound size and increased
the vascularity of the dermis of diabetic foot
wounds [102]. Infusion of MSCs promoted the
survival of allogeneic skin grafts in mice [103] and
baboons [104].
Injection of human MSCs derived from umbilical
cord blood into four men with Buerger's disease
relieved ischemic rest pain in their affected
extremities, led to healing of necrotic skin lesions
within four weeks, and improved peripheral
circulation [105].
Bone, cartilage and tendons
MSCs expanded in an osteoconductive carrier
regenerated a critical segmental defect in the
femur of dogs as effectively as autogenous
cancellous bone. Mismatched allogeneic stem
cells regenerated bone without eliciting an
immunologic response. This finding raised the
possibility of establishing allogeneic MSC banks
for bone regeneration [106]. MSCs were able to
reconstitute different layers in the femoral condyle
[107]. In a canine model, transplantation of MSCs
with partially demineralized bone matrix restored
bone defects and enhanced bone growth [108]. In
a rabbit model, MSCs regenerated full-thickness
defects of articular cartilage defects, repaired
Achilles tendon [107,109], and helped to
strengthen osteoporotic bone [110]. Implantation
of rat demineralised bone matrices (DBM) with
MSCs led to the formation of bone [111]. MSCs
engrafted in mice with OI led to a significant
increase in bone collagen and mineral content
[112]. In an ovine model, spraying autologous
MSCs onto grooved hydroxyapatite-coated collars
of segmental bone tumor implants increased bone
growth [113]. However, naive MSCs injected in
mouse knee joints could not differentiate to
restore cartilage tissue [114]. In addition, MSCs
transplanted to ectopic sites in mice underwent
alterations related to endochondral ossification
rather than adopting a stable chondrogenic
phenotype [115].
Use of MSCs in five children with OI disease
lead to a signifincat increase in the total body
mineral content and increased growth velocity
[116,117]. Three-dimensional tissue scaffolds
promoted MSC ectopic bone formation [118].
MSCs that were used to fill bone defects during
revision total joint replacement survived normal
impact force during this procedure [119].
Retina tissues, liver and teeth
MSCs formed structures similar to the
photoreceptor layer and expressed a
photoreceptor-specific marker in rats [120], and
could provide a beneficial effect in retinitis
pigmentosa [121]. Murine MSCs integrated into
retinal pigment displayed neuronal and glial
morphologies and preserved photoreceptor cells
in the rhodopsin knockout mouse [121].
Human MSCs grown in vitro gain the
characteristic morphology and function of
hepatocytes after transplantation into livers of
immunodeficient mice; they engrafted and
retained function of hepatocytes [122].
In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that
MSCs can differentiate into functional odontoblast-
like cells [123]. New populations of stem cells
isolated from the root papilla of human teeth
transplanted with periodontal ligament stem cells
(PDLSCs) generated a root/periodontal complex
capable of supporting a porcelain crown and
resulting in normal tooth strength and appearance
[124].
Role of MSCs in immunomodulation
Coculture of MSCs with allogeneic lymphocytes
failed to stimulate their proliferation, indicating that
these cells are innately not immunogeneic
[125,126,104]. Recent reports suggest that MSCs
have immunomodulatory properties and can inhibit
lymphocyte antigen presenting cells, natural killer
cells, and cytotoxic lymphocyte proliferation in
mixed-lymphocyte reactions (MLR)
[27,30,70,104,125-128].
MSCs inhibit CD2, CD4 and CD8 subsets of T
lymphocytes [127,128]. Despite the expression of
HLA by MSCs, they were well tolerated without
side effects in allogeneic hosts [27,61,104,129].
Reports on the underlying mechanisms of MSC-
mediated inhibitory effects are contradictory.
Soluble inhibitory factors, such as hepatocyte
growth factor [127], transforming growth factor-B
[127], indoleamine oxidase [130], human
leukocyte antigen-G [131] and interleukin-10 [132]
have been implicated as mediators of the MSC
inhibtory effect. However, the implication of TGF-
B, interleukin-10 and indoleamine oxidase has not
been demonstrated by others [27].
The importance of cellular contact between
MSCs and lymphocytes in enhancement of MSCs
inhibtory effect is contradictory [127,132,133].
Page 193

Co-transplantation of MSCs may prevent lethal
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in MHC-
mismatched murine HSC transplantation [129]. In
a baboon model, MSC injection led to prolonged
skin allograft survival [104]. Intravenous
administration of MSCs prolonged the survival of
transplanted hearts [134].
In humans, MSCs were used to treat severe
acute GVHD [135]. MSCs derived from
autoimmune disease (AD) patients exhibited
extensive anti-proliferative properties against
lymphocytes in vitro. This could be investigated as
a form of immunomodulatory cellular therapy for
AD patients [136].
In contrast, allogeneic and transgeneic MSCs
were rejected by mismatched recipient mice
[137,138]. In addition, concurrent treatment with
low-dose cyclosporine A and MSCs accelerated
allograft rejection [139]. MSCs failed to prevent
acute GVHD in mice [140].
MSCs and solid organ graft
MSCs revitalized cryopreserved allogeneic
grafts used to repair large musculoskeletal defects
[141]. They incorporated within the tissue sheath
around the tendon, and adopted the characteristic
spindle-shaped morphology of tenocyte-like cells
[141].
MSC transplantation into heart enhanced cell
survival, improved angiomyogenesis, and restored
global cardiac function [84]. The vascular
protheses, the inner surfaces of which are
covered with MSCs that overexpress nitric oxide
synthase, may have longer graft patency and
vasculoprotective effects [142]. Injection of MSC
enhanced xenochimerism in murine models,
thereby showing promise as a strategy to achieve
whole organ xenograft tolerance [143].
Role of MSCs in irradiation injury and in burns
Exposure of living cells to irradiation induces
DNA damage and results in immediate tissue
aplasia, or long term secondary effects resulting in
induction of cancer [144,145]. Acute radiation
syndrome affects hematopoietic, gastrointestinal,
neurovascular and cutanous systems [146].
Therapeutic irradiation can induce a significant
decrease of both mature and immature
progenitors in human BM and peripheral blood
immediately after low-dose total body irradiation
(TBI) (147). A dose of 2-8 Gy causes the
hematopoietic component of the acute radiation
syndrome in humans [148-150]. It has been
demonstrated that growth of irradiated CD34+
cells was enhanced by co-culture with MSCs
[151]. Injection of MSCs could help in the
management of therapeutic irradiation side effects.
Radiation enteritis is a functional disorder of the
intestine that can occur during or after a course of
radiotherapy of the abdomen, pelvis or rectum.
Radiation enteritis can present either as an
acute or a chronic form, both of which have life
threatening sequelae. The increasing use of
radiotherapy in the treatment of solid organ
malignancies in the abdomen and pelvis is likely to
increase the incidence of radiation enteropathy in
the future [152]. Moreover, it can damage normal
tissues during the course of therapy for a few
weeks after therapy, or even for months or years
[153].
The first challenge in therapeutic MSC
transplantation is how to efficiently deliver it to the
sites of intended action. TBI increased human
MSC engrafment in BM and muscle and further
led to engraftment in brain, heart and liver [50].
Local irradiation in addition to TBI induces homing
of human MSCs to exposed sites and promotes
widespread engraftment to multiple organs in
murine models [50]. It seems that inflammation
and tissue injury due to irradiation activate
molecular pathways that increase the release of
tissue chemokines. This attracts MSCs to injured
tissue, where they engraft and differentiate into
different tissues to replace the injured areas and
repair damage. MSCs accelerate structural
recovery and favour healing of irradiated tissues
[154]. Human MSCs were shown to support the
structural regeneration of the small intestine in
NOD/SCID mice after abdominal irradiation [154].
Amazingly, MSCs are resistant to irradiation [155].
Cells expressing the MSC phenotype were more
prevalent in the peripheral blood of burn patients
than in healthy donors. The percentage of MSCs
correlated with the size and severity of burns, and
with patient age [156]. Human MSCs favour
healing of cutaneous radiation syndrome in a
xenogenic transplant model [157].
MSCs in gene therapy
Transplantation of interleukin-7 (IL-7) gene-
engineered MSCs into lethally irradiated mice led
to a significant increase in thymopoiesis and
homeostatic expansion of peripheral T
lymphocytes. It also protected the host from
GVHD and enhanced immune reconstitution [158].
In a murine model, MSCs transfected ex vivo
with the hepatocyte growth factor gene were more
therapeutically efficient than MSCs alone in
protecting brain tissues from acute ischemic
damage in the midcerebral artery occlusion [159].
Transduction with the brain-derived neurotrophic
factor gene further enhanced the protective
efficacy against ischemic damage [160].
Page 194

Libyan J Med, AOP: 070705
Hypoxia-regulated HO-1 vector modification of
MSCs enhanced the tolerance of engrafted MSCs
to hypoxia-reoxygen injury in vitro and improved
their viability in ischemic hearts [161].
MSCs in cancer
MSCs possess excellent migratory ability and
exert inhibitory effects on the proliferation of
glioma cells [162]. Modification of MSCs by gene
therapy with therapeutic cytokines augments the
anti-tumor effect and prolongs the survival of
tumor-bearing animals [163]. MSCs transfected
with the epidermal growth factor receptor exhibit
enhanced therapeutic potential against murine
brain tumors [164].
In a model of Kaposi's sarcoma, human MSCs
injected intravenously homed to sites of
tumorigenesis and potently inhibited tumor growth
[165]. In a murine model, MSCs adenovirally-
engineered to secrete interleukin-12 prevented
revival and recurrence of tumor cells, which had
escaped from conventional treatment [166].
MSC-engineered hydroxyapatite used to fill the
patient's bone cavity after tumor curettage
demonstrated healing potential without adverse
reactions [167].
Genetically modified MSCs expressing the
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (tsFlk-
1) gene can inhibit growth of Burkitt's lymphoma
in a murine model [168]. MSCs can target tumour
cells [162] and have been suggested as a possible
approach for the delivery of therapeutic agents
[169]. MSCs transduced with an adenoviral
expression vector carrying the human IFN-beta
gene suppressed the growth of pulmonary
metastases, presumably through the local
production of IFN-beta in the tumor
microenvironment [170].
By contrast, it has been demonstrated that
MSCs could favour tumour growth in murine
models [126,171], but they do not interfere with the
kinetics of tumor development [171]. MSCs recruit
primary follicular lymphoma (FL) cells and trigger
their differentiation into fibroblastic reticular cells,
making them able to support malignant B-cell
survival [172].
MSCs target microscopic tumors and contribute
to the formation of a significant portion of tumor
stroma development in vivo [173].
Tumor cells, when mixed with MSCs and
transplanted subcutaneously, exhibited increased
capability of proliferation and angiogenesis in
tumour tissues and highly metastatic ability. When
human marrow-derived MSCs were injected into
tail veins of SCID mice bearing human malignant
melanoma, human cells incorporated into tumor
vessels and participated in angiogenesis [174].
Interaction of Multiple Myeloma cells with MSCs
resulted in the formation and persistence of
osteolytic bone lesions. However, 6-
bromoindirubin-3'-monoxime treatment reduces
the MSCs-stimulated proliferation of Multiple
Myeloma cells and may enable MSCs to repair
existing osteolytic lesions [175].
These results are contradictory, and further
experimental and clinical studies are needed to
evaluate the benificial effects of MSCs in cancer
therapy.

Conclusion
MSCs have a multipotent capacity. They
support hematopoiesis and have
immunomodulatory activity. Experimental and
clinical studies have implicated MSCs in tissue
repair. These characteristics make MSCs
particularly attractive for therapeutic exploitation,
such as regeneration of various tissues, induction
of tolerance in solid organ graft, and BM
transplantation. Figure 3 summarizes the possible
therapeutic applications of MSCs. However, the
beneficial versus deleterious effects of MSCs
Page 195

remain controversial. For instance, some studies
showed the tolerogeneic effect of MSCs in
recipients, while others showed that MSCs tended
to promote rejection. Some reports demonstrated
that MSCs had favourable effects on tumour
growth, while others found that MSCs reduced the
delay for tumour occurrence.
MSCs could provide opportunities for future
clinical use in cellular therapy. However, more
studies are needed on engraftment capacity,
differentiation, and possible adverse effects in
vivo.
