Abstract
Background: Plasma cells constitute the majority of tumor cells in multiple myeloma (MM) but lack the potential for
sustained clonogenic growth. In contrast, clonotypic B cells can engraft and recapitulate disease in immunodeficient mice
suggesting they serve as the MM cancer stem cell (CSC). These tumor initiating B cells also share functional features with
normal stem cells such as drug resistance and self-renewal potential. Therefore, the cellular processes that regulate normal
stem cells may serve as therapeutic targets in MM. Telomerase activity is required for the maintenance of normal adult stem
cells, and we examined the activity of the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat against MM CSC. Moreover, we carried out both
long and short-term inhibition studies to examine telomere length-dependent and independent activities.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Human MM CSC were isolated from cell lines and primary clinical specimens and treated
with imetelstat, a specific inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase activity of telomerase. Two weeks of exposure to imetelstat
resulted in a significant reduction in telomere length and the inhibition of clonogenic MM growth both in vitro and in vivo.
In addition to these relatively long-term effects, 72 hours of imetelstat treatment inhibited clonogenic growth that was
associated with MM CSC differentiation based on expression of the plasma cell antigen CD138 and the stem cell marker
aldehyde dehydrogenase. Short-term treatment of MM CSC also decreased the expression of genes typically expressed by
stem cells (OCT3/4, SOX2, NANOG, and BMI1) as revealed by quantitative real-time PCR.
Conclusions: Telomerase activity regulates the clonogenic growth of MM CSC. Moreover, reductions in MM growth
following both long and short-term telomerase inhibition suggest that it impacts CSC through telomere length-dependent
and independent mechanisms.

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the clonal
expansion of malignant plasma cells that results in anemia, renal
insufficiency, and bone disease. The introduction of several novel
agents has steadily improved therapeutic responses and clinical
outcomes in MM [1]. However, most patients eventually relapse
and die as a consequence of their disease despite these im-
provements. Tumor re-growth following initial reductions in
disease burden suggests that tumor cells capable of clonogenic
growth are relatively drug resistant, and in several human cancers
these functional properties have been attributed to cancer stem
cells (CSC). We previously found that MM cells responsible for
producing symptomatic disease in immunodeficient mice pheno-
typically resemble memory B cells rather than mature plasma cells
[2,3]. Furthermore, these clonotypic B cells exhibit several
attributes that characterize normal stem cells including self-
renewal during serial transplantation and multi-drug resistance.
These shared functional properties suggest that specific cellular
processes regulating normal stem cells may be active within CSC
and serve as potential therapeutic targets.
Telomerase is a ribonuclear protein complex minimally
consisting of protein (TERT) and RNA (TERC) components that
act as a reverse transcriptase to extend telomeres at the ends of
linear chromosomes [4,5]. In the absence of telomerase activity
(TA), telomeres undergo progressive shortening during successive
replication cycles, eventually reaching critically short lengths that
result in cellular senescence or apoptosis. Telomerase activation is
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 September 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 9 | e12487
a common feature of nearly all human cancers and is believed to
support continued cell replication [6,7]. In MM, the malignant
plasma cells from virtually all patients express activated telome-
rase, and higher TA correlates with decreased overall survival
[8,9]. Several studies have also demonstrated that the inhibition of
TA in MM plasma cells results in progressive telomere shortening
and growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo [10–21].
In normal adult tissues, telomerase is most active in long-lived
stem cells and progenitors, and then progressively decreases in
more differentiated progeny [22–24]. TA is also required for the
maintenance of normal stem cells, and in patients with
dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) inactivating mutations in TERT
and TERC may lead to the loss of normal hematopoietic stem cells
and aplastic anemia [25]. Thus, we studied the role of telomerase
in MM CSC by examining the effects of imetelstat, a specific
competitive inhibitor of the telomerase reverse transcriptase
activity [26]. We found that TA inhibition in MM CSC for two
weeks or longer progressively reduced telomere length and
decreased both colony formation in vitro and the engraftment of
immunodeficient mice. In addition, short-term imetelstat treat-
ment of MM CSC for 72 hours resulted in clonogenic growth
inhibition associated with the induction of differentiation, but not
telomere shortening. Therefore, TA inhibition may impact MM
CSC both by decreasing telomere length and modulating self-
renewal programs.
Results
Imetelstat inhibits TA in MM plasma cells and CSC
MM plasma cells express the characteristic surface antigen
CD138, but the self-renewing cells responsible for tumor
initiation in immunodeficient mice phenotypically resemble
memory B cells and are CD138neg
[2]. We initially examined
relative TA within CSC and bulk tumor cells and isolated
CD138neg
precursors and mature CD138+
plasma cells from pre-
sorted MM cell lines. In the RPMI8226 cell line, CD138neg
CSC
displayed greater TA than CD138+
plasma cells, while this
pattern was reversed in NCI-H929 cells (Figure 1A). In the U266
cell line, TA was similar between the two cell compartments. We
also studied primary clinical specimen from three distinct
patients and found that the levels of TA were similar in
CD138neg
CD19+
CD27+
precursors and CD138+
plasma cells
(Figure 1B). Taken together, these results demonstrate that
telomerase is active in both MM CSC and plasma cells, but
relative levels within each cell compartment may vary within
individual cell lines and patient specimens.

Telomerase Activity in Myeloma
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 September 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 9 | e12487
Several approaches have been developed to target telomerase
including antisense RNA directed against TERT, small molecules
that stabilize G-quadruplexes, and oligonucleotides acting as direct
inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase activity [27–31]. Imetelstat is
a synthetic lipid-conjugated 13-base oligonucleotide N39 P59-thio-
phosphoramidate complementary to the template region of
telomerase RNA (TERC) that acts as a competitive enzyme
inhibitor by binding and blocking the active site of the enzyme
[10,11,14]. This highly specific inhibitor of TA has been clinically
studied in patients with MM, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-
small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer [26,32]. We studied the
ability of imetelstat to inhibit TA in MM and treated RPMI8226,
NCI-H929, and U266 cells for 48 hours. Using the TRAP assay,
we detected at least a 60% reduction in TA in cells treated with
imetelstat compared to a mismatched control oligonucleotide
(Figure 1C). Similar degrees of telomerase inhibition have been
reported in MM and glioblastoma cells [11,33]. We also examined
telomerase inhibition in CD138neg
precursors and CD138+
plasma
cells isolated from the NCI-H929 cell line and found that
imetelstat inhibited TA by 58% and 74% in each of these cell
populations, respectively (Figure 1D).
Imetelstat reduces telomere length and limits the
clonogenic growth of CD138neg
MM CSC
Several reports have demonstrated that telomerase inhibition in
CD138+
MM plasma cells can reduce telomere length to a critical
threshold resulting in senescence and/or apoptosis[10–14,34]. We
examined the impact of imetelstat on MM CSC telomere length
and continuously treated pre-sorted CD138neg
cells isolated from
the NCI-H929 cell line. By two weeks, cells treated with imetelstat
displayed a significantly increased proportion (p,0.01, Figure 2A)
of shortened telomeres (,1.4 kb) using the single telomere length
assay (STELA)[35]. In order to examine the effects of telomerase
inhibition and progressive telomere shortening on the clonogenic
growth of MM CSC, CD138neg
cells were isolated from the
RPMI8226 and NCI-H929 cell lines, continuously treated with
imetelstat, and plated weekly in methylcellulose. Colony formation
was progressively inhibited with a 5-fold reduction at three weeks
and greater than 100-fold reduction after five weeks of treatment
(Figure 2B). We also examined primary clinical MM specimens
and treated pre-sorted CD138neg
bone marrow cells with
imetelstat. Compared to the control oligonucleotide, MM
clonogenic growth was significantly inhibited by approximately
5-fold after 3 weeks of imetelstat treatment compared to the
mismatch control group (P,0.01, Figure 2C).
We also examined the effects of imetelstat on a MM growth
in vivo. Previous studies demonstrated that imetelstat reduced the
growth of subcutaneous tumors in SCID mice [11,14]. In order to
examine the effects of imetelstat on systemic MM growth, NOD/
SCID mice were injected with NCI-H929 cells then treated with
imetelstat two weeks later. Treatment with imetelstat given three
times a week for a total of two weeks significantly extended survival
compared to the control mismatch oligonucleotide (p,0.01,
Figure 2D). Since this study could not distinguish between the
inhibition of bulk tumor growth or the self-renewal capacity of
CSC, we next examined the effect of imetelstat on MM
engraftment, a surrogate measure of self-renewal potential. We
treated NCI-H929 cells with imetelstat or mismatch control for
two weeks in vitro and subsequently injected them intravenously
into NOD/SCID mice. Pre-treatment of MM cells with imetelstat
significantly reduced the proportion and survival of mice
engrafting with MM compared to control oligonucleotide treated
cells (p,0.001, Figure 2E). Therefore, telomerase inhibition by
imetelstat significantly reduces MM clonogenic potential both
in vitro and in vivo in parallel with its effects on telomere length.
Short-term telomerase inhibition promotes MM
differentiation and depletes CSC activity
During the long-term treatment studies, we found that the
clonogenic growth of pre-sorted CD138neg
RPMI8226, NCI-
H929, and U266 MM CSC was significantly inhibited by 11–30%
following just 72 hours of imetelstat exposure (p,0.01, Figure 3A),
although telomere length was not significantly affected in NCI-
H929 cells after 1 week of treatment (p.0.05, Figure 2A).
Moreover, this effect was not mediated by the induction of cell
death as we found no difference in the proportion of apoptotic cells
following 72 hours of exposure to imetelstat (data not shown).
Similarly, we found that short-term treatment of pre-sorted
CD138neg
bone marrow cells from primary clinical specimens
with imetelstat significantly inhibited MM colony formation by 19-
29% compared to mismatch control treated samples (p,0.05,
Figure 3B). These data suggest that short-term imetelstat
treatment in MM impacts the functional capacity of MM CSC
independent of its effects on telomere length.
Several recent reports have suggested that telomerase may
regulate the differentiation and self-renewal of normal stem cells
independent of its effects on telomere length [33,36]. Therefore,
we examined the impact of short-term imetelstat treatment on the
differentiation of MM CSC. Treating presorted CD138neg
with
imetelstat, control oligo or vehicle, resulted in increased expression
of CD138 after just 72 hours without a significant difference
between the groups (Data not shown). To specifically evaluate the
effects of imetelstat on this process we evaluated the proportion of
CD138neg
cells in unsorted bulk cultures after 72 hours. We found
that the proportion of CD138neg
cells was decreased by
approximately 40% after short-term imetelstat treatment of
unsorted H929 cells (p,0.01, Figure 3C). MM CSC also express
relatively higher levels of ALDH activity compared to CD138+
plasma cells [2], and short-term imetelstat treatment significantly
decreased the ALDH+
population from 1.3% to less than 0.4%
(p,0.01, Figure 3D). These data suggest that short term TA
inhibition depletes the population of MM CSC by inducing their
terminal differentiation.
We hypothesized that telomerase may globally influence
pathways that regulate CSC cell-fate decisions and self-renewal.
Within embryonic stem cells, specific transcriptional regulators,
such as OCT3/4, NANOG, and SOX2 are critical for regulating self-
renewal and pluripotency [37–39]. Moreover, developmental
signaling pathways, such as Notch and Hedgehog, as well as the
polycomb gene BMI1 are thought to regulate both normal and
cancer stem cells [40–43]. We examined the expression of OCT3/4,
NANOG, SOX2 and BMI1 as well as the Hedgehog and Notch target
genes, GAS1 and HES1 in NCI-H929 cells and found that all were
detectable in the CD138neg
CSC, but not the bulk CD138+
plasma
cells (data not shown). Following treatment of CD138neg
NCI-H929
CSC with imetelstat for 72 hours, the expression of five out of six of
these stem cell genes was inhibited compared to mismatch control
treated cells (Figure 3E). These results suggest that short-term
telomerase inhibition may directly impact stem cell programs that
regulate CSC self-renewal.
Discussion
Highly clonogenic CSC have been identified in several human
malignancies, including MM, and their combined resistance to
chemotherapy and enhanced growth potential suggests that they
may be responsible for disease relapse and progression [2,3]. Thus,

the development of therapeutic agents that effectively target CSC
may improve long-term outcomes, such as progression-free and
overall survival. Few clinically applicable strategies have been
identified to date, but the cellular processes that regulate normal
stem cells, such as developmental signaling pathways, have
emerged as potential targets [44].
Increasing evidence suggests that telomerase is essential for
normal stem cell function. For example, TA is highest within stem
cells in rapidly proliferating tissues such as the bone marrow and
gut, and the longest telomeres within the skin are found with stem
cells [7,45–48]. The requirement for telomerase by normal stem
cells is illustrated by DKC in which inactivating mutations in

TERT or TERC result in degenerative failure of multiple organs
including the bone marrow from hematopoietic stem cell
exhaustion [25,49,50]. The anticipatory nature of DKC in which
successive generations experience disease manifestations at
younger ages suggests that telomere length rather than TA is the
primary factor that regulates normal stem cell function [5].
Similarly, Tertnull/null
or Tercnull/null
mice lacking TA do not
demonstrate degenerative phenotypes until they acquire critically
short telomeres through successive rounds of interbreeding
[51,52]. In MM, several reports have demonstrated that TA must
be inhibited for at least 2 to 3 weeks to reduce telomere length in
MM plasma cells and affect their growth and survival [11–13,53].
We examined CD138neg
MM CSC and also found that telomere
shortening following 2 weeks of exposure to imetelstat was
associated with decreased clonogenic growth both in vitro and
in vivo. Similar findings have been reported in glioblastoma [33];
thus, telomerase inhibition may target CSC across multiple tumor
types.
The efficacy of long-term telomerase inhibition suggests that
imetelstat modulates MM CSC growth and self-renewal primarily
by modulating telomere length. But we also found that short-term
drug exposure significantly inhibits clonogenic MM growth
associated with CSC differentiation. Therefore, telomerase inhibi-
tion may impact CSC function through both telomere length-
dependent and independent mechanisms. In a similar fashion,
short-term telomerase inhibition has been found to induce the
differentiation of medulloblastoma and melanoma cells as well as
sensitize glioblastoma CSC to cytotoxic chemotherapy [33,54–56].
In normal stem cells several studies have also suggested that
telomerase may impact self-renewal and differentiation programs
independent of effects on telomere length [57–59], but these results
contrast those in which both Tertnull/null
and Tercnull/null
mice display
no abnormalities until telomeres are shortened to critical lengths
[51,52]. Interestingly, hematopoietic stem cells isolated from early
generation Tercnull/null
mice with normal peripheral blood counts are
functionally impaired when exposed to the stress of bone marrow
transplantation [60,61]. Therefore, normal HSC may have different
requirements for intact telomerase activity depending on whether
they involved in homeostatic or stress hematopoiesis. In cancer,
telomerase activity exclusive of its effects on telomere length may be
particularly evident since CSC may display a high degree of
metabolic stress as demonstrated in acute leukemia [62].
We also found that short-term telomerase inhibition results in
decreased expression of genes, such as OCT3/4, NANOG, SOX2,
and BMI1, that regulate normal and cancer stem cells. Similarly,
TERT has also been found to directly activate epithelial stem cells
by inducing a Myc- and Wnt-related transcriptional program [36].
Furthermore, TERT is directly associated with the promoters of
Wnt target genes [63]. These findings suggest that telomerase may
interact with essential pathways during stem cell-fate decisions and
that modulation of these other pathways may further enhance the
anti-tumor activity of telomerase inhibitors.
Materials and Methods
Patient samples, cell lines and cell culture
Bone marrow samples were obtained from patients with active
MM granting signed consent for sample acquisition using a protocol
and consent forms approved by the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutes Review Board. All patients were newly diagnosed and
included those with Stage II (n = 2) and Stage 3 (n = 4) disease
according to International Staging System (ISS) criteria [64].
Mononuclear cells were isolated by density centrifugation (Ficoll-
Paque, Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) and depleted of CD34+
hematopoietic progenitors using CD34 magnetic microbeads
(Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA). Plasma cells were further isolated
by positive magnetic selection using CD138 selection beads
(Miltenyi Biotech). CD138neg
CD19+
CD27+
MM CSC were
isolated by FACS (see below). Isolated cells were also assessed for
clonotypic immunoglobulin light chain expression by flow cytom-
etry and demonstrated .90% isotype restriction matching the
malignant plasma cells.
The human MM cells lines NCI-H929, RPMI8226 and U266
were obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection
(Manassas, VA). All cells were cultured in complete media
consisting of RPMI 1640, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicil-
lin, 50 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
For drug treatment studies cells were treated with 1 mM imetelstat,
GRN163L (59-palm-TAGGGTTAGACAA-39) or 1 mM mis-
match control oligonucleotide, GRN140833 (59-palm-TAGGTG-
TAAGCAA-39) (Geron Corporation, Menlo Park, CA) prepared
in phosphate buffered saline.
For the analysis of in vitro clonogenic growth treated cells were
washed free of drug and plated at a density of 1,000 cells/mL for
cell lines or 200,000 cells/mL for CD138neg
CD34neg
bone
marrow mononuclear cells in 1.2% methylcellulose, 30% FBS,
1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1024
M 2-mercaptoethanol,
and 2 mM L-glutamine. For clinical specimens, the methylcellu-
lose cultures also contained 10% lymphocyte conditioned media as
a source of growth factors [2]. Samples were plated in triplicate
onto 35 mm2
tissue culture dishes and incubated at 37uC and 5%
CO2. Colonies consisting of more than 40 cells were scored
between 14 and 21 days with an inverted microscope. Serial
replating was performed by collecting methylcellulose and washing
cells in complete media then resuspending a fixed proportion (1/
10–1/1,000) of the cells in 1 ml of methylcellulose as described
above.
Telomerase activity and telomere length quantification
Telomerase activity was quantified using a real-time PCR based
quantitative telomerase detection kit according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Allied Biotech Inc., Ijamsville, MD). Equal cell
numbers (16105
–106
cells) were used for each experiment and
relative telomerase activity was calculated based on the value of 2 ‘
difference in CT value. XpYp single telomere length assay
(STELA) was performed using the methods described by Baird
et al.[35] Telomere signals were detected using TeloTAGGG
Telomere Length Assay kit (Roche, San Francisco, CA). Four
separate PCR reactions (1–2 ng genomic DNA per reaction) were
set up for each sample and run in separate lanes on agarose gels.
Total number of telomere bands from the lanes for each sample
were pooled and calculated. Telomere shortening was quantified
by determining the percentage of telomere bands less than 1.4 kb
to the total number of bands in the sample.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and flow cytometry
For antigen expression evaluation and cell sorting, anti-human
CD138-fluourescein isothyocyanate (FITC), CD19-FITC, and
CD27-allophycocyanin (APC) antibodies were used (BD Pharmin-
gen, San Diego, CA). Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity
was detected using the Aldefluor reagent (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Control staining reactions consisted of isotypic antibodies or
addition of the specific ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzalde-
hyde (DEAB). CD138+
and CD138neg
cells were isolated from
human MM cell lines by staining with anti-CD138 as well as 2 mg/
ml propidium iodide (PI, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cells
were initially gated on a FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences) by

forward and orthogonal light scatter, then analysed to collect
CD138neg
PIneg
and CD138+
PIneg
cells. For clinical specimens,
MM CSC were isolated by staining peripheral blood mononuclear
cells with anti-CD19, anti-CD27, and PI. Cells were initially gated
to eliminate cellular aggregates and necrotic material by forward
and orthogonal light scatter and PI exclusion, then analyzed for
CD19 and CD27 expression. Apoptosis analysis was performed
using Annexin V (BD Biosciences) and PI staining. Briefly, cells
were incubated with Annexin V-FITC in Annexin binding buffer
followed by staining with 5 mg/ml PI and analysis by flow
cytometry. Annexinneg
PIneg
cells were considered viable and
compared across treatment groups. Cell surface antigen or ALDH
expression was examined by counterstaining cells with 2 mg/ml PI
followed by analysis of cells initially gated to eliminate cellular
aggregates and necrotic material by forward and orthogonal light
scatter and PI exclusion quantification. Cells were analyzed using
either a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) or
FACSAria cell sorter.
Transplantation of MM cells into NOD/SCID mice
All animal studies were approved by the Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutes Animal Care Committee. Nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice were bred and
maintained in the Johns Hopkins animal core facility. NCI-H929
cells (16106
–107
cells/animal) were injected into the tail vein of 6–
10 week old mice. For in vivo treatment experiments, imetelstat or
mismatch control oligonucleotide (30 mg/kg) was injected intra-
peritoneally three times a week for two weeks. Mice were observed
daily and sacrificed following the development of symptoms. MM
engraftment was confirmed by detecting human k immunoglob-
ulin light chain in mouse sera using ELISA (Bethyl Labs,
Montgomery, TX) and human CD138+
plasma cells in the mouse
bone marrow by flow cytometry.
Reverse transcriptase PCR
RNA was isolated using RNAqueous (Ambion, Austin, TX), and
cDNA made using Superscript II (Invitrogen) with random hexamers
according to the manufacture’s protocol. For quantitative RT-PCR
Taqman real-time primer/probes sets (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA) were used to detect cDNA for GAS1 (Hs00266715_s1),
NANOG (Hs0238700_g1), SOX2 (Hs01053049_s1), HES (Hs00707120
_s1), OCT3/4 (Hs00999652_g1) and BMI1 (Hs00180411_m1) and
b-actin (4352935E). PCR was performed using TaqMan Universal
Master Mix (4304437, ABI) on an I-Cycler Real-Time PCR machine
(BioRad, Hercules, CA). Expression levels were normalized to b-actin
and compared with the DDCT method.
Statistical analysis
Results are presented as the mean 6 SEM. Comparisons
between groups were performed using a 2-tailed, paired Student t
test. Kaplan-Meier analysis was carried out using a log rank test. P
values ,0.05 were considered significant.
