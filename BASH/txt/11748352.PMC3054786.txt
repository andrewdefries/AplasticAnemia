INTRODUCTION
Aplastic anemia (AA) is a potentially severe bone marrow
(BM) disorder characterized by peripheral pancytopenia and
BM that is largely devoid of hematopoietic cells and is re-
placed by fatty tissue, while retaining the basic marrow archi-
tecture or stroma (1). The treatment of choice for severe AA
(SAA) in patients under the age of 40 yr is bone marrow trans-
plantation (BMT), whereas patients with moderate AA, pa-
tients with SAA who lack a compatible donor, and those over
the age of 40 yr are treated with immunosuppressive agents
(1, 2).
Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a noninvasive and
relatively rapid method of BM study because of its exclusive
ability to directly show a large volume of BM (3-5). MR
imaging of BM in AA has been widely reported, but prog-
nostic implication of MR imaging according to the treat-
ment methods used has been only reported in a few series
(6-9). The aim of this study was to investigate the features
of MR imaging of BM for monitoring the therapeutic effects
of BMT or immunosuppressive therapy in patients with
SAA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
MR imaging of BM was retrospectively reviewed in 16
patients (13 males and 3 females) who had attained complete
clinical responses following allogeneic BMT or immuno-
suppressive therapy with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG)
and cyclosporine A. Response was defined as reaching com-
plete independence of transfusions. The mean age of the pa-
tients was 26 (range, 15-38) yr. Eight patients were treated
with BMT and the others with ALG and cyclosporine A. The
interval between MR examination of BM and treatment was
about 33 (21 in BMT group and 59 in ALG group) weeks.
In two of eight patients with BMT and six of eight patients
with immunosuppressive therapy, MR imaging of BM was
performed prior to treatment.
MR imaging of BM was performed with a 0.5T (Gyroscan
T5, Phillips, Eindhoven, Netherlands) or a 1.5T (Magnetom
plus, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) superconductive MR
unit. Sagittal T1-weighted images (T1WI, TR/TE=560/30
msec at 0.5T or 500/12 msec at 1.5T) and short tau inver-
sion recovery (STIR, TR/TE/TI=1,400/30/120 msec at 0.5T
or 3,600/30/150 msec at 1.5T) images of the lumbar spine
were obtained. Image factors were 5-mm slice thickness with

Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Bone Marrow After Bone Marrow
Transplantation or Immunosuppressive Therapy in Aplastic Anemia
To compare magnetic resonance (MR) images of the bone marrow (BM) after
bone marrow transplantation or immunosuppressive therapy in patients with aplas-
tic anemia (AA), MR imaging of BM was reviewed retrospectively in 16 patients
(13 males and 3 females, mean age 26 yr) with AA who completely responded
clinically after transplantation or immunosuppressive therapy. The signal intensity
(SI) of BM was classified into four patterns according to the increasing amount
of cellular marrow, i.e., pattern I to IV. SI of MR imaging of BM exhibited an in-
crease of cellular marrows following both transplantation and immunosuppres-
sive therapy. Of the eight patients on transplantation, the SI of the lumbar spinal
BM was pattern III in two patients and IV in six on T1-weighted and short tau
inversion recovery (STIR) images. In the eight patients with immunosuppressive
therapy, the SI of the lumbar spinal BM was pattern II in one, III in five, and IV in
two on T1-weighted images and pattern II in one, III in four, and IV in three on
STIR images. SI on MR imaging of the lumbar spinal BM showed a more cellu-
lar pattern in patients on transplantation than in those on immunosuppressive
therapy.

a 0.5-mm intersection gap, 205×256 matrix, four signal
acquisitions, and 350-mm field of view on all pulse sequences.
Coronal T1WI of the pelvis (TR/TE=560/30 msec at 0.5T
or 750/12 msec at 1.5T) with 6-mm slice thickness and 0.6-
mm intersection gap were also obtained.
MR images were interpreted by two radiologists who
reached a consensus. The signal intensity (SI) of BM from
the first to fifth lumbar bodies and the pelvic bone on both
T1WI and STIR images was summated visually and classi-
fied into four types according to the increasing amount of
cellular marrow. On T1WI, diffusely homogeneous, high SI
was classified as pattern I, hyperintense background with less
than 25% of low SI nodules as pattern II, extensive mixed
high and low SI with a half or more area of high SI as pat-
tern III, and diffuse low SI with scattered high SI nodules of
less than 25% as pattern IV. On STIR with reversed SI, pat-
tern I was defined as diffusely homogeneous low SI, pattern
II hypointense background with less than 25% of high SI
nodules, pattern III mixed patchy high and low SI with a
half or less area of high SI, and pattern IV diffusely high SI
with less than 25% of low SI area.
According to SI patterns seen on T1WI and STIR images,
BM was categorized as follows: I, homogeneous fatty pat-
tern; II, focal cellular pattern; III, mixed fatty and cellular
pattern; and IV, cellular pattern with focal fatty nodules. On
T1WI, low signal was equal to or less than the signal of par-
avertebral muscle, and high signal was equal to the signal of
subcutaneous fat. On STIR images with fat suppression, mar-
row SI was rated as high or low in relation to the signal of
paravertebral muscle.
These SI patterns of MR imaging of lumbar spinal & pelvic
BM were analyzed in patients with SAA following BMT or
immunosuppressive therapy.
RESULTS
The clinical features and SI patterns of MR imaging of BM
in 16 patients with SAA after BMT or immunosuppressive
therapy are summarized in Table 1.
In eight patients who underwent MR imaging of BM
before BMT or immunosuppressive therapy, SI pattern of
spinal BM changed to represent higher cellularities (from
patterns I and II to patterns III and IV). Likewise, the SI
pattern of the pelvic BM changed from patterns I and II to
patterns II and III.
The SI patterns of MR imaging of the lumbar spinal BM
after treatment were different depending on the modalities
although complete responses were attained in both BMT and
immunosuppressive therapy groups. Of the eight patients
on BMT, SI of the lumbar spinal BM was pattern III in two
patients and IV in six on TIWI and STIR images (Fig. 1).
Of the eight patients on immunosuppressive therapy, SI of
lumbar vertebral BM was pattern II in one patient, III in
five, and IV in two on T1WI and II in one, III in four, and
IV in three patients on STIR images (Fig. 2). The SI pattern
of MR imaging of the lumbar spinal BM after BMT was more
cellular, with small fatty portions, than that after immuno-

suppressive therapy.
The lumbar spinal and pelvic BM after treatment showed
different SI patterns: patterns III and IV were much more
frequently seen in lumbar spinal BM (15 of 16 patients),
whereas patterns I and II were common in pelvic BM (10 of
16 patients) on T1WI. The SI pattern on MR imaging of
the pelvic BM after BMT or immunosuppressive therapy
represented more fat than that of the spinal BM.
DISCUSSION
The application of MR techniques has become an impor-
tant imaging modality for diagnostic and follow-up after
treatment of various hematologic diseases (3-5, 10). MR im-
aging is complementary to BM biopsy in that although MR
shows only the gross anatomy of the marrow, it can sample
a large fraction of active marrow in a single, noninvasive clini-
cal study.
In AA, findings of MR imaging and their roles in moni-
toring patients have been reported (6-9, 11-13). In untreated
stages, marrows demonstrate a diffuse, high SI, reflecting
preponderance of fatty marrow and lack of hematopoietic
marrow. After treatment, foci of low signal intensity, repre-
senting islands of hematopoietically active tissue, appear in
the yellow marrow. BMT is a well-established treatment of
choice for patients with SAA who have HLA-matched donors.
The use of ALG alone or together with cyclosporine A is also

accepted as an effective form of treatment for patients with
SAA who lack HLA-matched donors and who are over 40
yr of age.
In normal adults, the distribution of hematopoietic and
fatty marrow relative to age has been extensively described
(14-16). Since the hematopoietic marrow remains through-
out life in the lumbar spine, the pelvis, and the intertroch-
anteric area of the femur, these areas were assessed in our
study.
The SI of MR images correlates with the density and the
relaxation behavior of the protons in tissues. There are two
considerable fractions of protons in normal red marrow, i.e.,
water and lipids. The separation and quantification of these
protons within red marrow are important issues of MR imag-
ing of BM. BMT or immunosuppressive therapy in patients
with AA results in an increasing fraction of water within
BM by the regeneration of hematopoietic cells (8, 9). Our
protocol included sagittal T1WI and STIR imaging of the
lumbar spine and coronal T1WI of the pelvis. The short T1
relaxation time (higher SI) of the fatty marrow allows non-
invasive assessment of the amount and distribution of the
tissue by T1WI. STIR images characterize the yellow mar-
row as SI being nullified and therefore appearing black. The
T1 and T2 contrast of tissues other than fat is additive, and
contrast sensitivity is thus greatly enhanced (3, 17, 18). Be-
cause the fat signal is highlighted on T1WI, whereas the
cellular portion is emphasized on STIR images, one (patient
No. 14) of our patients was classified as pattern III on T1WI

but as IV on STIR images.
Our results showed that the patients on BMT had SI of
more cellular pattern than the patients on immunosuppres-
sive therapy, despite the complete responses in both groups.
However, two (No.10 and 15) of the eight patients on im-
munosuppressive therapy recurred with pancytopenia 1 yr
later. None of the eight patients on BMT experienced a relapse
of the disease during the mean three (one to six) years of aver-
age period of follow-up.
It is not well known where the initial BM recovery takes
place following BMT or immunosuppressive therapy. Our
results showed that SI on MR imaging of the lumbar spinal
BM after therapy appeared to have a more cellular pattern
than that of the pelvic BM, suggesting the earlier hemato-
poietic recovery in the lumbar spinal marrow cavity.
There were several limitations in our study. Firstly, initial
MR imaging was available in only two cases on BMT and
six on ALG therapy. Therefore, changing patterns of SI on
MR imaging with the treatment could not be clearly evalu-
ated in all patients. Secondly, the SI pattern of BM was eval-
uated visually, not quantitated. Lastly, all the patients stud-
ied were complete responders and patients in whom BMT or
immunosuppressive therapy had failed or just induced par-
tial responses were not included, suggesting a selection bias.
In conclusion, MR imaging of BM showed slight differ-
ences in its SI patterns, depending on the treatment modal-
ities applied. The lumbar spinal BM showed a more cellular
pattern in patients treated with BMT than in those treated
with immunosuppressive agents. Recovery of BM cellulari-
ty in the lumbar spinal BM preceded that of the pelvic BM.
