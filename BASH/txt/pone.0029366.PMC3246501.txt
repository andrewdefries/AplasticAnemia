Abstract
Background: Polymorphisms in the Glutathione S-transferase genes are associated with altered risks in many cancers, but
their role in oesophageal cancer is unclear. Recently a 37-kb deletion polymorphism of GSTT2B that reduces expression of
GSTT2 has been described. We evaluated the influence of the GSTT1 and GSTT2B deletion polymorphisms, and the GSTP1
Ile105Val polymorphism (rs1695) on susceptibility to oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in the Black and Mixed
Ancestry populations of South Africa.
Methods and Results: The GSTT1, GSTT2B and GSTP1 variants were genotyped in 562 OSCC cases and 907 controls, and
tested for association with OSCC and for interaction with smoking and alcohol consumption. Linkage disequilibrium (LD)
between the deletions at GSTT1 and GSTT2B was determined, and the haplotypes tested for association with OSCC. Neither
the GSTT1 deletion nor the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism was associated with OSCC risk in the Black or Mixed Ancestry
populations. The GSTT2B deletion was not associated with OSCC risk in the Black population, but was associated with
reduced risk of OSCC in the Mixed Ancestry population (OR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.57–0.90, p = 0.004). Case-only analysis showed
no interaction between the GST polymorphisms and smoking or alcohol consumption. LD between the neighboring GSTT1
and GSTT2B deletions was low in both populations (r2
Black = 0.04; r2
MxA = 0.07), thus these deletions should be assessed
independently for effects on disease risk.
Conclusions: Although there was no association between the GSTT1 deletion polymorphism or the GSTP1 Ile105Val
polymorphism with OSCC, our results suggest that the presence of the recently described GSTT2B deletion may have a
protective effect on the risk of OSCC in the Mixed Ancestry South African population. This is the first report of the
contribution of the GSTT2B deletion to cancer risk.

Introduction
Oesophageal cancer is the third most common malignancy of
the digestive tract and the seventh leading cause of cancer-related
deaths worldwide [1]. Cancer of the esophagus exists in two main
forms with different etiological and pathological characteristics:
oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oesophageal
adenocarcinoma (OADC). OSCC is the predominant histological
subtype in developing countries [2] and occurs at higher
frequencies in Southern and Eastern Africa, Northern China
and the central Asian belt from Turkey through Iran, Iraq and
Kazakhstan [3–6]. In South Africa it is one of the most common
malignancies and the most common cancer among Black males,
with a variable incidence rate among regions [7]. The regional
difference in the frequency of OSCC is probably due to genetic
polymorphism and variable exposure to environmental factors,
including nutritional factors that are associated with the
development of this disease [8]. Epidemiological studies have also
identified smoking and alcohol consumption as major risk factors
associated with OSCC [9–11]. Our studies have shown that
genetic polymorphisms in the alcohol metabolizing enzymes
(ADH2*1 and ADH3*2) and detoxification enzymes (SULT1A1,
CYP3A5 and P450 2E1) are associated with susceptibility to OSCC
in the South African population [12–15].

The Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are the major phase II
metabolizing enzymes and play a key role in cellular detoxification
of toxic compounds such as tobacco-related carcinogens [16].
Specifically, GSTs catalyze the conjugation of glutathione (GSH)
to a wide variety of substrates with electrophilic functional groups
including the products of oxidative stress, environmental pollutants
and carcinogens, thereby neutralizing their electrophilic sites and
producing stable and soluble compounds easily excreted from the
organism [17]. Homozygous deletion of GST genes that results in
a total lack of the enzyme activity is a common polymorphism in
humans [18]. The GSTT1 and GSTT2 genes are located at a
recombination-prone locus on chromosome 22q11.23 separated
by about 50 kb [19,20]. GSTT1 is flanked by two highly
homologous regions (HA3 and HA5) that share an identical
403-bp repeat (Fig. 1). A homologous recombination event
involving the HA5 and HA3 403-bp repeats results in a 54-kb
deletion containing the entire GSTT1 gene resulting in a lack of
GSTT1 activity [21]. The GSTT2 gene is part of a 64-kb inverted
repeat (DNA-IR), the other copy of which is located immediately
adjacent to GSTT2 and contains the homologous pseudogene,
GSTT2B, which shares 98% sequence identity with GSTT2 (Fig. 1).
A recent study [22] reported that a 37-kb deletion of the proximal
repeat encompassing the GSTT2B gene reduces expression of the
GSTT2 gene by more than 80% in cell lines homozygous for the
deletion. The frequency of GSTT1 and GSTT2B deletions varies
between populations. Homozygous deletions of GSTT1 are present
in 15–20% of Whites, 45–64% of Asians and 20–41% of Sub-
Saharan Africans [23–27]. The GSTT2B homozygous deletion
occurs in approximately 42% of Whites, 29% of Japanese/Chinese
and 18% of the Yoruban population of West Africa [22]. The
GSTP1 gene is located on chromosome 11q13 and is the major
GST expressed in the oesophagus [28]. GSTP1 contains a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 313 (A.G) that
substitutes Isoleucine (Ile) for Valine (Val) at amino acid position
105, resulting in an enzyme with altered substrate affinity and
decreased enzyme activity [29]. Approximately 29% of Whites
and 15% of Asians are carriers of the GSTP1 Val105 variant allele
[30–33], and the frequency varies from 16% to 24% among
Southern and Eastern Africans. In South African Xhosa the
frequency was reported as 53%, which is significantly higher than
that reported for other African ethnic groups [27].
The importance of glutathione conjugation by GSTs enzymes
in carcinogen detoxification and drug metabolism led to extensive
studies of polymorphisms in these genes as potential risk factors for
different types of cancer [18,34]. In oesophageal cancer, meta-
analysis showed that the GSTT1 deletion allele was not associated
with increased risk of oesophageal cancer in Whites and Asians,
but was associated with a reduced risk of OSCC in the Brazilian
population [35,36]. A recent meta-analysis reported association of
the GSTP1 Val105 allele with increased risk of OSCC in Whites
[37], and we previously reported association of the GSTP1
Ala114Val but not Ile105Val SNP with an increased risk of
OSCC in the South African population [15].
In view of the somewhat conflicting nature of previous reports,
and the new evidence of an important functional deletion at the
GSTT1/2 locus, we have investigated the relationship between the
GSTT1 and GSTT2B deletions and the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymor-
phism and susceptibility to OSCC in the South African Black and
Mixed Ancestry populations. Features of the study design include a
much larger sample size than in previous work to provide greater
statistical power, separate analysis of the Black and Mixed Ancestry
data to avoid confounding the analysis by differences in genetic
structure, and the use of multiplex PCR assays which differentiate
heterozygotes from homozygotes for the GSTT1 and GSTT2B
deletions, thus allowing full resolution of all 3 possible genotypes.
Using the above genotyping assays, we successfully genotyped
the GSTT1, GSTT2B and GSTP1 variants in 562 OSCC cases and
907 controls, and tested for association with OSCC.
The risk of OSCC has been associated with smoking and
alcohol consumption in multiple studies, and we therefore tested
for a gene-environment interaction in a case-only analysis,
stratifying cases by smoking and alcohol consumption status.
This is, to our knowledge, the largest investigation to date of the
association of GST functional polymorphisms with cancer in
African populations, and the first to assess the role of the GSTT2B
deletion in cancer risk.
Results
GSTT1 deletion analysis
The genotype and allele frequencies for the GSTT1 deletion
polymorphism in the two South African populations were determined
by multiplex PCR assay [21], which allows resolution of all 3 possible
genotypes (Figure 2A). The results are shown in Table 1. No
significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium was found in
Black controls; a marginal deviation was observed among Mixed
Ancestry controls, which is not significant after correcting for multiple
testing across the population groups and polymorphisms
(pBlack =0.359; pMxA =0.038). In order to investigate whether this
deviation was due to genotyping error, 20% of samples were re-
genotyped. There was no discrepancy between the two genotyping
results, suggesting that the deviation from HWE was not due to
genotyping error. The Mixed Ancestry population in South Africa is a
heterogeneous ethnic group originating from the union of Europeans
and Asians with several African populations, including the Xhosa [38].
Differences in the frequency of the deletion allele in these various
ethnic groups [23–27] in combination with non-random mating may
explain the modest deviation from HWE observed in this study. The
GSTT1 deletion was not associated with OSCC in either population
Figure 1. Deletion polymorphisms of the GSTT1 and GSTT2B
genes. The GSTT1 and GSTT2 genes are part of the Theta-class GST
gene cluster on chromosome 22q11.23. GSTT1 and GSTT2 are separated
by approximately 50 kb and share 55% sequence homology. GSTT1 is
flanked by two 18 kb regions, HA5 and HA3, which are more than 90%
homologous. In their central portion, HA3 and HA5 share a 403-bp
sequence with 100% identity. HA5 and HA3 are direct repeats. The
GSTT1 null allele arises by homologous recombination of the left and
right 403-bp repeats, which results in a 54-kb deletion containing the
entire GSTT1 gene. GSTT2 is positioned adjacent to the HA5 repeat. The
duplicate copy of GSTT2 is a pseudogene named GSTT2B, because of an
abnormal exon 2/intron 2 splice site that causes a premature translation
stop. GSTT2 and GSTT2B are inverted repeats. The deletion of GSTT2B
has a strong influence on GSTT2 gene expression, as described in the
text.

(Table 1). The frequency of the GSTT1 deletion allele in Black controls
(55%) was similar to that reported for the Yoruban population (57%),
with 30% of individuals being homozygous for the deletion. In the
Mixed Ancestry controls the allele frequency (49%) was lower than
that reported for Asian populations (65%) and higher than in Whites
(33%), which is consistent with the origins of this population, with 22%
of individuals being homozygous for the deletion [22]. A case-only
analysis of smoking and drinking did not detect any interaction
between environmental risk factors and the GSTT1 deletion
polymorphism in either the Black or Mixed Ancestry populations
(Table 2). In the Mixed Ancestry population, the small number of
smokers (N=13) was below the threshold for a meaningful case-only
analysis (see Methods).
GSTT2B deletion analysis
The PCR assay for the GSTT2B deletion is illustrated in
figure 2B, and the genotype and allele frequencies are shown in
Table 1. The observed genotype counts are comparable with
expected and no deviation from HWE was observed in either
control group (pBlacks = 0.362; pMxA = 1). The The GSTT2B
deletion was not associated with OSCC in the Black population,
although the frequency of the deletion allele was lower in cases
than in controls. In the Mixed Ancestry population the GSTT2B
deletion allele was significantly less frequent in cases than in
controls, and thus associated with a reduced risk of OSCC
(OR = 0.71; 95% CI 0.57–0.90, p = 0.004) (Table 1), with a p-
value below the Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p = 0.0083.
Further analysis of the GSTT2B polymorphism in the Mixed
Ancestry population showed a stronger evidence for association
under a dominant model of inheritance for the deletion (p = 0.002
for association), with carriers of the deletion allele having an OR of
0.57 (95% CI 0.40–0.81). The frequency of the GSTT2B deletion
in Black controls (37%) was lower than that reported for a small
Yoruban HapMap sample (47%), and the frequency in the Mixed
Ancestry controls (50%) was lower than that reported for a
Western European HapMap sample (63%) but identical to that for
Figure 2. PCR assay for GSTT1 and GSTT2B deletion genotyping. A four primer set was used in a single reaction to determine the presence or
absence of the GSTT1 allele. (A); Primers A-L and A-R amplify a 459 bp sequence present in the GSTT1 gene, while primers O-L and O-R amplify a joint
sequence of 1460 bp resulting from the deletion of GSTT1. When GSTT1 is not deleted, the DNA fragment (GSTT1) between the forward (O-L) and
reverse primers (O-R) is too long for amplification and only the 459 bp sequence is amplified. Conversely, when GSTT1 is deleted, the 459 bp
sequence is not amplified because absent while the 1460 bp fragment is now amplified. As a result of the PCR reaction, the only presence of a 459 bp
band (lines 1–3 in the gel picture) or of a 1460 bp band (lines 7, 8) defines the WT/WT and the del/del genotypes respectively; while the presence of
both fragments defines the heterozygous genotype (lines 4–6). Lane 9 was used as negative control. Solid lines represent genomic sequences; white
rectangle represents the deleted sequence; small gray triangles indicate the 408 bp repeats flanking the GSTT1 gene. Expected PCR products are
drawn as small gray bars. (B); A three primer set is used to determine the deletion polymorphism of GSTT2B in a single reaction. Primers 2B and 6857
amplify a 847 bp fragment detecting the presence of the GSTT2B gene, while primers 6857 and 6858 amplify a 505 bp sequence resulting from the
deletion of GSTT2B. The 6857 primer is used for amplification of both fragments. When GSTT2B is not deleted, the DNA fragment (GSTT2B) between
the 6857 and 6858 primers is too long for amplification and only the 847 bp fragment is amplified. Conversely, when the gene is deleted, the 505 bp
fragment is amplified and the 847 bp fragment is not amplified. As a result of the PCR reaction we can have three possible polymorphisms: one single
847 bp (lines 1–3 in the gel picture) or one single 505 bp band (lines 6–8) represent the WT/WT and the del/del polymorphisms rispectively; while the
contemporary presence of both bands represents the WT/del polymorphism (lines 4, 5). Lane 9 was used as a negative control. Solid lines represent
genomic sequences; black rectangle represents the deleted sequence. Expected PCR products are drawn as small gray bars.

the Japanese/Chinese [22]. As with GSTT1, a case-only analysis
did not detect any interaction between the GSTT2B deletion and
smoking or alcohol use in either Black or Mixed Ancestry
populations (Table 2), and interaction with smoking could not be
tested in the Mixed Ancestry population because of the small
number of non-smokers. However, in a case-control analysis of
drinkers and smokers in the Mixed Ancestry population, the
protective effect of the GSTT2B deletion was marginally stronger
than in all cases (OR = 0.69 for both groups, p = 0.002 and 0.003
for smokers and drinkers respectively).

GST Polymorphisms and OSCC Risk in South Africa
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 December 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 12 | e29366
GSTP1 Ile105Val SNP (rs1695)
The genotype and allele frequencies obtained for the GSTP1
Ile105Val SNP (rs1695) in the two populations is shown in Table 1.
The 105Val allele was common in both populations, and genotype
frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls
(p.0.05). This SNP was not associated with OSCC in either the
Black or Mixed Ancestry populations. The frequency of the
GSTP1 Val105 allele in Black controls (53%) was marginally
higher than that reported for African HapMap populations (36%–
51%), but identical to that previously reported for South African
Xhosa (53%) [27]; while in Mixed Ancestry controls it was slightly
higher (44%) compared to Whites (41% in HapMap CEU). Case-
only analysis did not detect any interaction between smoking or
alcohol use and this SNP in either population group (Table 2). The
non-smoker sample size in the Mixed Ancestry population (N = 13)
was too low to perform an interaction test in this subgroup.
Linkage disequilibrium analysis
Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the GSTT2B and GSTT1
deletion polymorphism was low in both populations. In the Black
population, LD measures were r2
= 0.04 and D9 = 0.27. In the
Mixed Ancestry population the GSTT1 and GSTT2B deletions
both have similar frequencies (0.495 and 0.501 respectively), but
all four possible haplotypes exist, giving r2
= 0.07 and D9 = 0.33,
with the Del-Del and wildtype-wildtype (WT- WT) haplotypes having
lower frequencies than expected under linkage equilibrium.
Haplotype analysis in the Black population showed no overall
evidence of association (p = 0.500), and none of the individual
haplotypes was associated with OSCC (Table 3). In the Mixed
Ancestry population, strong evidence for association was obtained
overall in the haplotype analysis (p = 0.0089), but this was due
solely to the effect of GSTT2B, and conditional analysis showed
that including GSTT1 had no additional effect (p = 0.35).
Examining the haplotype-specific results (Table 3) shows that the
two haplotypes with a significant effect compared to the baseline
WT-WT haplotype both carry the deletion at GSTT2B (WT-DEL,
DEL-DEL), and have similar OR of 0.58, indicating that carrying
an additional deletion at GSTT1 did not reduce OSCC risk
further. In Mixed Ancestry individuals, who were successfully
genotyped for both the GSTT1 and GSTT2B deletions, 13 of 414
controls (0.031) and 16 of 217 cases (0.074) were homozygous for
both deletions (genotype Del-Del/Del-Del), which was a marginally
significant difference (p = 0.027). In Black individuals this genotype
was present in 22 of 462 controls (0.048) and 17 of 311 cases
(0.055), which was not a significant difference (p = 0.786).
Discussion
In this study we have investigated the involvement of the
GSTT1 deletion, the GSTP1 functional polymorphism Ile105Val
and the recently described GSTT2B deletion, which greatly
reduces expression of GSTT2, in susceptibility to OSCC in two
South African populations. The GSTT1 deletion was genotyped
using a multiplex PCR assay which discriminates between
subjects carrying zero, one or two functional alleles of the
GSTT1 gene [21]. Such individuals show a trimodal pattern of
enzyme activity [39], thus discrimination between the 3
genotypes is important in the assessment of possible increased
cancer risk in deletion heterozygotes. In our study, the GSTT1
genotype showed no evidence of association with OSCC in
either the Black or the Mixed Ancestry populations, which is
consistent with the meta-analysis in White European and Asian
populations [35]. Our analysis of the GSTP1 Val105 allele also
showed no association with OSCC. We did, however, observe
association of the GSTT2B deletion with a reduced risk of
OSCC in the Mixed Ancestry population (OR = 0.71; 95% CI
0.57–0.90). We did not find this association in the Black
population; however the odds ratio (0.86) did overlap with the
95% confidence interval for the Mixed Ancestry population, so
it is possible that a smaller effect might be revealed in the Black
population in a larger sample size.
Power calculations show that our study is well-powered to
identify association with variants that confer a direct association,
and moderate power to detect a gene-environmental interaction.
The Mixed Ancestry sample has 82% power to detect a genetic
variant with frequency 0.5 (similar to the genotyped variants)
which confers an increased odds ratio of 1.4 under an additive
model. For the larger sample size in the Black population, there is
a similar level of power (83%) to detect a lower odds ratio of 1.35.
For the gene-environment interaction in a case-only analysis, an
odds ratio of 1.75 would be detectable with power of 0.83 for the
Mixed Ancestry population, and 94% for the Black population
(assuming 30% exposure prevalence).

GST Polymorphisms and OSCC Risk in South Africa
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 December 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 12 | e29366
Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is a high-incidence
cancer in South Africa, with smoking and alcohol drinking being
important risk factors. We examined the interaction between
smoking and alcohol use and the GSTT1, GSTP1 and GSTT2B
polymorphisms on risk of OSCC by testing for a difference in
allele frequency between smokers and non-smokers, and between
drinkers and non-drinkers (case-only analysis). We found no
evidence for a different effect of the GST polymorphisms in
smokers and non-smokers in either the Black or the Mixed
Ancestry populations. Similarly, no interaction was detected with
alcohol use.
The lack of an interaction betweeen the GSTT2B deletion and
smoking or drinking in the Mixed Ancestry population may reflect
the small numbers of cases in the non-smoking and non-drinking
groups. For smoking, the number of non-smokers (N = 11) was too
small to perform a meaningful statistical test. However, the
protective effect of this deletion in smokers from the Mixed
Ancestry population was marginally stronger than in all Mixed
Ancestry cases.
The low level of linkage disequilibrium between GSTT1 and
GSTT2B which we observed in both the Black and Mixed
Ancestry populations (r2
,0.1) shows that the two deletions are
independent and require separate assessment for disease risk in
these populations. These results are broadly consistent with those
of Zhao et al. [22], which reported strong LD between these
deletions in Whites (r2
= 0.699), but weaker LD in the Japanese/
Chinese (r2
= 0.173) and very low LD in Yorubans (r2
= 0.005).
Also, haplotypes with both GSTT1 and GSTT2B deletions were
less frequent than expected in both South African populations
(observed 5% and 16% vs 28% and 25% expected in Black and
Mixed Ancestry populations respectively), which is consistent with
the underrepresentation of the double-deletion haplotype in
Whites [22]. The haplotype association test did not detect any
association with OSCC in the Black population. The GSTT1/
GSTT2B DEL-DEL haplotype was associated with reduced risk of
OSCC in the Mixed Ancestry population, but the GSTT1 deletion
had no effect either alone or in combination with GSTT2B. It is
interesting that a small proportion of both cases and controls are
homozygously deleted for both GSTT1 and GSTT2B, and are
therefore likely to have little or no activity for the theta class of
GST enzymes.
There are several possible explanations for the protective role of
the GSTT2B deletion in OSCC. GSTs catalyze the conjugation of
GSH to a wide variety of electrophilic compounds to produce
water-soluble compounds which are excreted easily from the
organism. GSH depletion to about 20–30% of total GSH levels
may impair the conjugation defence against electrophilic com-
pounds, which in turn could damage DNA and cause cancer
initiation. Thus, the combined conjugation activities of GSTs may
lead to GSH depletion and thereby increase cancer risk.
Conversely, a decrease in GST activity as a result of deletion of
some of the corresponding genes may produce an optimal GSH
level to protect the organism against carcinogens. An alternative
explanation may relate to the fact that GSTs, in addition to
detoxification of carcinogens, can cause toxic effects in the cell.
GSTs can convert several classes of compounds, via conjugation
with GSH, into cytotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic metabolites
that can readily attack DNA and cause cancer initiation [16]. In
this context, it is possible that the reduced GSTT2 activity caused
by the GSTT2B deletion may protect individuals from cancer. The
fact that GSTs have overlapping substrate affinity is also relevant
in this context. Thus deficiency of a single GST enzyme may not
result in decreased detoxification of carcinogenic compounds
because other GSTs with similar substrate specificities can
compensate. The lack of association of GSTT1 and GSTP1
polymorphisms with OSCC observed in this study may reflect
provision of their enzyme activity by other carcinogen-metaboliz-
ing enzymes. Simultaneous determination of the polymorphism of
all the GSTs may therefore be an important prerequisite for
reliable interpretation of the role of GST superfamily in
susceptibility to OSCC. This could be addressed by development
of a microarray that allowed genotyping of all known relevant
polymorphisms in the GST and other gene families involved in the
detoxification of carcinogens.
In conclusion, we have shown that the presence of the recently
described GSTT2B deletion and the consequent reduction in
GSTT2 expression may have a protective effect on the initiation
and development of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in the
Mixed Ancestry South African population. It will be important to
determine whether this effect can be replicated in other
populations with a high incidence of OSCC, and to determine
whether it contributes to susceptibility to other forms of cancer.
Materials and Methods
Study group
All patients diagnosed with OSCC were recruited from Groote
Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, with the diagnosis confirmed by
histopathological examination. Control samples were recruited
from the healthy individuals from same population groups as the
patients and from the same area, age-group, gender and ethnic
group. Demographic information including ethnicity, language,
gender, age, smoking and drinking habits was collected by
interviews conducted by professional research nurses. This study
was limited to Black and Mixed Ancestry South African
individuals since they have a high prevalence of OSCC [7]. The
Mixed Ancestry population was formed about 300 years ago from
the union of different ethnic groups, receiving genetic contribu-
tions from the indigenous Khoi and San people and from
Indonesian, European and sub-Saharan African populations [40].
A total of 1469 blood samples (907 controls and 562 cases) were
collected. The control group included 479 Black and 428 Mixed
Ancestry individuals, while the case group included 330 Black and
232 Mixed Ancestry individuals. Written informed consent was
obtained from all control individuals and patients. Ethical
approval for the study was obtained from the joint University of
Cape Town/Groote Schuur Hospital Research Ethics Committee.
Isolation and Purification of DNA
Blood samples were collected and stored at 220uC prior to
DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted according to the
method of Gustafson et al. [41]. DNA concentration was
determined by PicoGreen assay and the DNA samples were
diluted to a concentration of 50 ng/ml for storage at 220uC.
Determination of the GSTT1 and GSTT2B deletion
genotypes
The GSTT1 deletion polymorphism was genotyped by multiplex
PCR assay as previously described [21]. A four primer set was
used to identify both the deletion and non-deletion alleles in a
single reaction (Fig. 2A). Briefly, 50 ng of genomic DNA was
added to buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dNTPs,
10 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer and 0.5 U of HotStart
Taq polymerase, with GC-rich solution (Roche). Fragments were
amplified in a final volume of 10 ml. The PCR reaction was
carried out in an Applied Biosystems (Veriti Thermal Cycler) and
thermal cycling conditions consisted of an initial hot start of
15 min at 95uC followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95uC for

30 sec, annealing at 65uC for 30 sec, and extension at 72uC for
1:30 min, with a final extension at 72uC for 7 min. Genotyping of
the GSTT2B deletion polymorphism was performed by multiplex
PCR assay using a three-primer set for simultaneous amplification
of the non- deletion and deletion alleles (Fig. 2B), as previously
described [22]. The PCR reaction was performed in a final
volume of 10 ml with 0.5 U Taq polymerase (GoTaq, Promega),
1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dNTPs, 10 pmol of each primer, and
50 ng of genomic DNA. The thermal cycling conditions consisted
of an initial hot start of 95uC for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of
denaturation at 95uC for 30 sec, annealing at 55uC for 30 sec, and
extension at 72uC for 60 sec. The final extension was at 72uC for
5 min. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 1%
agarose gels in Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer. The gels were stained
with ethidium bromide and digitally photographed using a UV
transilluminator (Syngene Gel Documentation System, SN SYDR
4/2525). GeneRuler DNA Ladder Mix (Fermentas) was used as
marker.
Determination of the GSTP1 genotype
The GSTP1 Ile105Val SNP (rs1695) was determined by
TaqMan genotyping assay using fluorescent allele-specific Taq-
Man probes (reagents from Applied Biosystems). Amplification
was performed in a total volume of 5 ml containing 2.5 of ml of
TaqMan Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0,25 ml of SNP probe
and 5 ng of DNA diluted in dH2O. The thermal cycling
conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95uC for
15 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 92uC for 15 min
and annealing/extension at 60uC for 60 sec. Fluorescence was
measured using a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system and
genotypes were assigned using SDS 2.2.2 software (Applied
Biosystems). Successful genotyping was achieved for all 3 genetic
variants in 99% of samples, with 12 samples classified as
undetermined and not included in the study.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed in a case-control design and the
analysis was performed separating the Black and Mixed Ancestry
population groups to avoid confounding effects due to ethnicity.
Genotype counts among controls were tested for deviation from
Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) using the chi-square test
with one degree of freedom [42].
The genetic association study was performed assuming a
multiplicative genetic model for any risk allele. We used a chi-
square test on the allele-based 262 table, which tests for
differences in allele frequency between cases and controls. Odds
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for
the tested allele. A conservative p-value threshold of 0.0083
( = 0.05/(2*3)) was used for assessing significance, applying a
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing of the two population
groups and three polymorphisms tested. Significant results were
followed up by investigation of dominant and recessive genetic
models.
We performed case-only analysis of drinking and smoking by
alleles using a 262 table of alleles against drinking or smoking
status (yes/no). Where sample sizes were sufficiently large ($40
cases in each group), we tested for differences in allele frequency
using a chi-square test.
We determined the level of LD between the GSTT1 and
GSTT2B deletions, and tested for association of GSTT1/GSTT2B
haplotypes with OSCC using UNPHASED [43].
Power calculations were carried out using Quanto, assuming a
significance level of 0.05 (http://hydra.usc.edu/GxE).
