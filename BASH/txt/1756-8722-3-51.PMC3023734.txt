Abstract
Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective treatment for severe
aplastic anemia (SAA). However, graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are major causes of the early
morbidity in Allo-HSCT.
Methods: To reduce graft failure and GVHD, we treated fifteen patients with SAA using high- dose of HSCT with
both G-CSF mobilized PB and BMSCs from HLA-identical siblings to treat patients with SAA.
Results: All patients had successful bone marrow engraftment. Only one patient had late rejection. Median time to
ANC greater than 0.5 × 109
/L and platelet counts greater than 20 × 109
/L was 12 and 16.5 days, respectively. No
acute GVHD was observed. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 6.67%. The total three-year probability of disease-
free survival was 79.8%.
Conclusion: HSCT with both G-CSF mobilized PB and BMSCs is a promising approach for heavily transfused and/or
allo-immunized patients with SAA.
To the Editor
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-
HSCT) is a cure for patients with severe aplastic anemia
(SAA). However, complications such as graft failure and
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) have limited the appli-
cation of allo-HSCT [1,2]. Increasing the number of donor
blood stem cells decreases graft failure, however, high-
dose of blood stem cell transplantation also increases the
incidence of GVHD[3]. A combination of un-manipulated
marrow and T-cell depleted PBSC as the stem cell source
for SAA have shown rapid engraftment without increasing
the risk of GVHD [4,5]. Here, we report that transplanta-
tion of un-manipulated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)
combined with bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) in
patients with SAA to reduce the incidence of graft failure
without negative effects on GVHD.
Fifteen SAA patients, received HLA- 6/6-identical sib-
ling G-CSF-mobilized PB plus BMSC transplantation
(Table 1). CY/ALG (12/15 patients) or Flu/CY/ALG
(3/15 patients) were used as conditioning regimen for
all of them. CsA-MMF regimen was used to prevent
aGVHD. Other supportive treatment were also given,
such as acyclovir, intravenous rhG-CSF, and intravenous
immunoglobulin. The engraftment of transplant cells
was determined using the following methods: STR-PCR
analysis, Y PCR analysis, and tests for hematopoietic
reconstitution and GVHD.
All fifteen patients receiving allo-HSCT had successful
bone marrow engraftment except for one of them had a
late rejection. The incidence of acute and chronic GVHD
was 0% and 6.67%. The reasons for the decreased inci-
dence may be multifactorial, the use of G-CSF mobilized
PBSC + BMSCS as the source of grafts, usage of ALG in
conditioning regimen and CsA/MMF for the prophylaxis
of GVHD. No recipients died from treatment-related
complications within the first 100 days after transplanta-
tion. There were twelve disease-free survivals. The total
three-year probability of disease-free survival was 79.8%
(Figure 1).

Our data indicate that high- dose of HSCT with both
G-CSF mobilized PB and BMSCs resulted in a quick
engraftment, low graft rejection, a relatively low inci-
dence of acute GVHD, and good DFS, although larger
scale, prospective, and randomized studies are required
to confirm these benefits.
