Radiotherapy and concomitant/adjuvant therapy with temozolomide are a common treatment regimen for children and adults
with high-grade glioma. Although temozolomide is generally safe, it can rarely cause life-threatening complications. Here we
report a case of a 31-year-old female patient who underwent surgical resection followed by radiotherapy plus concomitant
temozolomide. She developed pancytopenia after adjuvant treatment with temozolomide. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy
showed hypocellularity with very few erythroid and myeloid cells, consistent with aplastic anemia. In the English literature, aplastic
anemia due to temozolomide is extremely rare.
1. Introduction
The standard management of patients with glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) includes surgical resection followed by
radiotherapy (RT) plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolo-
mide [1]. Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent and
is generally well-tolerated treatment with fatigue, throm-
boembolic events, and lymphopenia as the most common
side eﬀects. Grade III or IV myelosuppression is a relatively
uncommon side eﬀect that is reported in 4% of patients
[2]. We hereby describe a case of GBM treated with surgical
resection followed by RT plus concomitant and adjuvant
temozolomide, who developed a progressive irreversible
aplastic anemia.
2. Case Report
A 31-year-old female was admitted to the neurosurgery
department with fainting and headache. MRI of the brain
revealed a mass in the left frontal lobe. She underwent
a left frontal craniotomy and complete excision revealing
a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Later, she was started
on antiepileptic medication, phenytoin, and referred for
adjuvant treatment. She started concomitant brain RT with
TMZ, administered at 150 mg/m2 for 5 days every 4 weeks.
After three cycles of adjuvant TMZ therapy, she was admitted
to the medical oncology department with fever, and complete
blood count showed pancytopenia with hemoglobin level
6.3 g/dL (13.6–17.2), platelet count 19,000/mm3 (156,000–
373,000), and total leucocyte count 100/mm3. TMZ was
stopped. She was treated with blood products, growth
factors, and antibiotics. Phenytoin was changed to carba-
mazepine. Her medical history revealed a fever continuing
for 30 days with productive cough. Chest radiograph and CT
scan revealed an inﬁltration at the superior segment of the
left lower lobe with pleural eﬀusion. Aspergillus sp. grew in
bronchial washing and sputum cultures, cytology revealed
no malignancy, and cultures were negative for tuberculosis.
Forty days later, blood tests showed hemoglobin level
8.3 g/dL (13.6–17.2), platelet count 16,000/mm3 (156,000–
373,000) and total leucocyte count: 50/mm3. Clinical and
radiographic ﬁndings were not improved. Bone marrow
aspiration and biopsy were subsequently performed. The
biopsy was severely hypocellular with very few erythroid and
myeloid cells at any stage of diﬀerentiation and hardly any
identiﬁable progenitor cells, suggesting features of aplastic
anemia (Figure 1). Cytogenetic analysis of marrow was not
performed. She did not receive co-trimoxazole prophylaxis,

and her vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were normal. The
patient had a rapidly deteriorating course and died due to
septicemia.
3. Discussion
Adverse eﬀects of TMZ are typical of traditional cytotoxic
chemotherapy. Myelosuppression is often dose limiting
with speciﬁc guidelines regarding dose reductions based
on neutrophil and platelet counts. Myelosuppression tends
to occur later in the treatment cycle; it is noncumulative
and generally reversible within two weeks [3]. Grade 3
and 4 hematological toxicity was documented in only 7%
of patients on concurrent therapy treated prospectively in
the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC) and National Cancer Institute of Canada
(NCIC) landmark study [2]. Gerber et al. described 52
patients developing severe myelosuppression after radiother-
apy and concomitant adjuvant temozolomide therapy with
high-grade gliomas [4].
Aplastic anemia is classiﬁed as inherited or acquired
depending on etiology, and nonsevere or very severe on
the basis of degree of pancytopenia. Aplastic anemia is
thought to result from injury or destruction of pluripotential
stem cells aﬀecting all subsequent blood cell populations.
Erythrocytes, granulocytes, and platelets may decrease to
dangerously low levels. The pathophysiology of aplastic
anemia is now believed to be immune mediated, with active
destruction of blood-forming cells. Drugs and chemicals
are among the most frequent causes triggering the aberrant
immune response [5].
In the English literature, Doyle et al. described three
patients developing severe myelosuppression after low-dose
TMZ and RT. Two patients with aplastic anemia were given
concurrent co-trimoxazole [6]. Villano et al. described a
case of aplastic anemia after the 4th cycle of adjuvant TMZ,
and the patient was on concomitant anticonvulsant [7].
In the case described here, the patient was also receiving
phenytoin, which typically causes agranulocytosis rather
than pancytopenia. Phenytoin was stopped but pancytopenia
did not recover.
It is important to be aware of the potentially life-
threatening toxicity of every chemotherapeutic agent, includ-
ing temozolomide. Temozolomide should be prescribed with
recognition of the potential side eﬀects reported here.
