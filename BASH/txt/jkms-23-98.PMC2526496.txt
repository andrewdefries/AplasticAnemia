INTRODUCTION
Many complications occur during hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) due to regimen-related toxicities and
graft-related toxicities. The cytoreductive regimens that are
used in conventional HSCT damage the rapidly dividing cell
populations, particularly the bone marrow progenitor cells and
mucosal epithelial cells. These deficits cause various bacterial
infections during the neutropenic pre-engraftment period (1).
In the pre-engraftment period, pulmonary edema syndromes
can occur because of pulmonary infections, iatrogenic fluid
overload, and cardiac dysfunction caused by prior treatments
with anthracyclins or radiation (2). In addition to the pulmo-
nary edema syndromes, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD),
acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), and engraftment syn-
drome (ES) are also common during the pre- and peri-engraft-
ment period.
ES has both an obscure pathogenesis and disease definition.
ES is characterized by a noninfectious fever and various other
clinical findings during the early neutrophil recovery phase,
including skin rash, pulmonary infiltrates, and weight gain
(3-5).
We observed the characteristic clinical findings that mimic
ES during the pre-engraftment period but not during the early
neutrophil recovery period after HSCT. In this work, we desc-
ribe these clinical findings as pre-engraftment syndrome (pES)
and also report the results of a retrospective incidence and risk
factor analysis for pES in pediatric patients who received HSCT
from various stem cell sources.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From September 1997 to March 2004 all patients who re-
ceived HSCT with bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood (PB),
and cord blood (CB) at Dong-A University Hospital were
consecutively entered into this analysis, which was approved
by the institutional review board of Dong-A University Hos-
pital. Of the total 56 patients who received HSCTs during
this period, 6 patients were excluded from the study because
they did not have sufficient medical records. Sixteen patients
had acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 8 patients had acute
lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 5 patients had chronic myel-
ogenous leukemia, 4 patients had myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS), 11 patients had severe aplastic anemia (SAA), 3 patients
had neuroblastoma, 2 patients had Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome,

Pre-engraftment Syndrome in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation
The clinical findings of fever and skin rash with or without evidence of fluid reten-
tion, which mimic engraftment syndrome, have been observed during the pre-en-
graftment period in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
In order to characterize this newly observed clinical syndrome called pre-engraft-
ment syndrome (pES), we retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of 50 patients.
Three out of 14 patients (23.1%) who underwent cord blood stem cell transplan-
tation developed non-infectious fever, skin rash, and tachypnea 4-15 days prior to
neutrophil engraftment. Two patients spontaneously recovered with fluid restric-
tion and oxygen inhalation. One patient died of a complicated pulmonary hemor-
rhage in spite of aggressive supportive therapy and steroid treatment. Four out
of 23 patients (17.4%) who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
developed non-infectious fever and skin rash 4 to 5 days prior to neutrophil engraft-
ment. All four of these patients recovered with only steroid treatment. These char-
acteristic findings were not observed in patients who had undergone autologous
peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Interestingly, the speed of neutrophil
engraftment was significantly faster for the patients suffering from pre-engraftment
syndrome. The close observation and further pathophysiological research are re-
quired to better understand this syndrome.

and 1 patient had non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Sources
for the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) were bone marrow in
23 patients, peripheral blood in 13 patients, and cord blood
in 14 patients (Table 1). The patients’ median age was 8.4 yr
(range: 1-18 yr) and the median weight was 33 kg (range:
6-76 kg). The male-to-female ratio was 1:0.61.
Conditioning regimens
All patients were treated with conventional doses of condi-
tioning chemoradiotherapy. The conditioning regimens for
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were busulfan/
cyclophosfamide for leukemia (n=11) and MDS (n=4), cyclo-
phosfamide/procarbazine/antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (n=6)
or cyclophosfamide/thoraco-abdominal irradiation/ATG (n=2)
for SAA. For the cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBSCT),
the conditioning regimens were busulfan/melphaln/ATG for
leukemia (n=10) and SAA (n=2) and busulfan/cyclophos-
famide/ATG for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (n=2). For the
autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBS-
CT), the conditioning regimens were carmustine/etoposide/
cytosine arabinoside/cyclophosfamide for AML (n=6) and
NHL (n=1), busulfan/cyclophosfamide for ALL (n=2), and
melphalan/etoposide/carboplatin for neuroblastoma (n=3).
Finally, for the allogeneic haploidentical PBSCT, the condi-
tioning was cyclophosfamide/procarbazine/ATG for the pati-
ent with SAA (n=1).
Supportive care
Hematopoietic growth factor support and isolation, as well
as antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral prophylaxis were pe-
rformed according to institutional protocols. Briefly, all the
patients received intravenous daily doses of granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (G-CSF, 5 g/kg or 300 g/m2
) from day
0 or day 5 until an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) above
500/ L was achieved for 3 days. The patients also received pa-
cked red blood cell transfusions to maintain hemoglobin lev-
els at 8.0 gm/dL or higher. Platelets were also transfused to
keep the platelet count at 20,000/ L or greater. All blood prod-
ucts were irradiated to 1,500 cGy and then filtered prior to
transfusion. In order to decontaminate the gut, all the patients
received vancomycin plus kanamycin orally. Fluconazole was
given for antifungal prophylaxis until an ANC above 500/ L
was observed. Pnemocystis jiroveci prophylaxis consisted of tri-
methoprim/sulfamethoxazole until day-1. After this point, the
treatment was resumed three times a week following the my-
eloid engraftment. Finally, all patients received prophylactic
acyclovir and preemptive gancyclovir treatment for herpes sim-
plex virus and cytomegalovirus infections.
Patients with fever had a comprehensive workup performed
for infections that included urine culture and blood cultures
through the peripheral line as well as through the central lines.
This workup was followed by an empirical systemic antibi-
otic therapy.
Prophylaxis for GVHD
For GVHD prophylaxis, cyclosporin with or without met-
hotrexate was used for allogeneic sibling BMT and methotrex-
ate plus cyclosporin or tacrolimus was used for unrelated BMT.
Cyclosporin with or without methylprednisone was used for
CBSCT.
Definition of the pES
In order to characterize the pES, we used criteria similar to
those that describe ES, but included only symptoms that oc-
curred during the pre-engraftment period before neutrophil
engraftment, not during the early neutrophil recovery phase.
Engraftment was defined as absolute neutrophil count greater
than 0.5×109
/L for two consecutive days. Those symptoms
are noninfectious fever and skin rashes mimicking GVHD
with or without the evidence of fluid retention.

Statistics
All data were expressed as mean±standard deviation. Statis-
tical analyses were performed by t-tests, Moses extreme reac-
tions tests, and Fisher’s exact tests on SPPS software, version
10.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). Significance was assumed
when p values were less than 0.05.
RESULTS
Incidence of pES
Seven out of 50 patients (14%) fulfilled the diagnostic cri-
teria for pES. Of these seven patients, 4 were male and 3 were
female. The median age and body weight of the patients with
pES were 6.7 yr (1-12) and 25.7 kg (8-48), respectively. Three
cases of pES developed in the patients who received unrelat-
ed CBSCT, 3 cases developed in the patients receiving allo-
geneic sibling BMT, and 1 case was observed in an unrelat-
ed BMT. pES did not develop in the patients who received
PBSCT (Table 2).
Description of pES
The clinical characteristics of patients with pES are present-

patients was 3-7 days, and the time of onset for these symp-
toms was 4-15 days before neutrophil engraftment. Tachypnea
with pulmonary infiltrates was recognized in 3 patients who
received CBSCTs.
Four patients (UPN-3, 6, 12, and 18) who presented with
fever plus skin rash without respiratory symptoms complete-
ly resolved with methylprednisone therapy. However, one of
these patients (UPN-18) developed acute GVHD on day +20
and expired from complications due to multiorgan failure. One
patient (UPN-35) who presented with fever plus skin rash with
respiratory symptoms had a spontaneous resolution of the sy-
mptoms.
Another patient (UPN-36) developed fever plus skin rash
with tachypnea on day +8 and abruptly progressed with wors-
ening pulmonary edema and hypoxia. We treated this patient
with methylprednisone and fluid restriction as well as endo-
tracheal intubation. With these therapies, the pulmonary ed-
ema abruptly resolved on the next day (Fig. 1) and the neutro-
phils were engrafted on day +13. Finally, one patient (UPN-
32) who developed fever plus skin rash with tachypnea on day
+8 was treated with methylprednisone and fluid restriction.
However, this patient expired on day +14 due to complica-
tions of pulmonary hemorrhage.
The histopathological findings of skin rashes in patients with
pES (UPN-32) revealed similar findings compatible with those
of acute GVHD (Fig. 2).
Risk factors and outcomes of the pES
We found no significant differences between the patients
with and without pES occurrences with regard to gender, age,
body weight, ABO incompatibility, human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) disparity, infused cell dose, and the starting date of G-
CSF treatment. The source of stem cells, i.e., BM, PB, and CB,
also had no impact on the pES occurrences (Table 4).
The engraftment speed was more rapid for patients with pES
who received BMT (10.75±0.5, 10-11 day) than for patients
without pES (12.31±2.47, 9-18 day) (p=0.032). Furthermore,
the engraftment speed was also more rapid for patients with
pES who received CBSCT (17.5±6.36, 13-22 day) than for pa-
tientswithoutpES(32.14±15.12,12-61)(p=0.143)(Table5).
Acute GVHD appeared in 1 out of 7 patients (14.28%) who
developed pES and in 4 out of 43 patients (9.30%) without
pES. Hepatic VOD developed in 1 out of 7 patients (14.28%)
with pES and in 2 out of 43 patients (4.65%) without pES. pES
had no impact on the occurrence of acute GVHD (p=0.707)
andhepaticVOD(p=0.342)(Table5).

The 5-yr survival rate was 71.43% for patients with pES and
49.59% for patients without pES. However, we found no sig-
nificant differences in the survival rate with regard to the occur-
rence of pES (p=0.417) (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
Many etiological factors can cause fever, skin rashes, and pul-
monary infiltrates during the pre-engraftment period follow-
ing HSCT. These factors include infections, chemotherapeutic
or antibiotic agents, immunosuppressive agents, growth fac-
tors, and blood products (3, 4, 6). ES also contributes to the
fever, skin rashes, and pulmonary infiltrates that develop in
the early neutrophil recovery phase (3, 4). In this study, with
the comprehensive septic workup and clinical course, we were
able to show that concurrent infections, ES, and other etiologic
factors are not the causative factors for fever, skin rashes, and
pulmonary infiltrates. We considered the syndromes that pre-
sented to our patients before engraftment, were different from
ES occurring during the early engraftment period. Therefore,
the characteristic findings mimicking ES that were observed
during the pre-engraftment period in this study could be
another clinical syndrome that follows HSCT.
Takaue also observed this clinical syndrome in about 70%
of CBSCT patients who received reduced-intensity condition-
ing regimens. He referred to this event as an “early inflamma-
tory syndrome (EIS)” (personal communication, 2003). There
have been no definite criteria or proven pathophysiological
etiologies for this clinical syndrome until now. Thus, we pre-
ferred to describe this condition as “pre-engraftment syndrome”
because it develops during the pre-engraftment period. Even
though Takaue told that the incidence of EIS was about 70%

Pre-Engraftment Syndrome in HSCT 103
inCBSCTpatients,weobservedpESinonly14%ofallpatients
and in only 21.4% of the CBSCT patients. Further studies are
required to determine whether the high incidence of EIS in
Takaue’s experience was related to the patient’s characteristics
or reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.
ES risk factors have been identified in many studies (7-10)
and include gender (9), the infused cell dose (9, 10), the stem
cell source (9), and G-CSF use (9). We also analyzed the risk
factors for pES, but we could not find any with significance.
However, these results might be related even with the small
study size. Although other studies have reported that the ES
occurred more frequently in autologous HSCT than in allogene-
ic HSCT (4, 5, 9), our study revealed that pES developed only
in allogeneic HSCT, and not in autologous PBSCT.
The pathophysiology of ES has not been well clarified. The
complex interplay of the microenvironment with the cytokines
of the interacting cells, which occurs during the engraftment
process, can play an important role in this syndrome (3, 10-
14). These cytokines have been well correlated to neutrophil
regeneration during the post-transplant period (10). Ravoet
et al. (10) reported that neutrophil engraftment was more
rapid and enhanced in patients with ES than in patients
without ES. Although we did not perform these cytokine
studies, we suspect that the positive impact of pES on the
speed of neutrophil engraftment in this study may also be
due to various cytokine effects.
In most patients, the pES was completely resolved either
spontaneously or with methylprednisone and supportive ther-
apy. The beneficial effects of steroid therapy may be derived
from its immunosuppressive effect on cytokine reactions and
from its anti-inflammatory nature. However, close observation
is required for patients with pES because some cases became
worse and were refractory to methylprednisone and support-
ive therapy.
In summary, we have described a new distinctive clinical
syndrome that occurs during the pre-engraftment period. This
syndrome is very similar with ES, yet unique in the timing of
its occurrence. pES may be associated with enhanced engraft-
ment and has no impact on the other clinical outcomes. How-
ever, patients with this syndrome should be closely moni-
tored for the possibility of rapid deterioration and early ther-
apeutic challenges. The disease entity and diagnostic crite-
ria of pES are obscure; therefore, further multicenter clinical
studies and pathophysiological research are required for bet-
ter understanding of this newly described syndrome.
