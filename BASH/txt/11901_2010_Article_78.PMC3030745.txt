Abstract Hepatitis C is one of the leading causes of liver
disease in the United States, affecting more than 4 million
individuals. The current treatment regimen involves pegy-
lated interferon in combination with ribavirin. Although
antiviral treatment has been associated with a greater than
50% sustained viral response rate, the adverse effects have
proven to be detrimental to quality of life and therapy
adherence, and consequently lead to lower sustained viral
response rates. This article identifies the most frequently
described complications associated with pegylated interfer-
on and ribavirin. The active management of these compli-
cations is discussed, including both preventive and empiric
treatments.

Introduction
Hepatitis C is a major public health concern. With almost 4
million Americans with chronic infection, hepatitis C is the
one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease and is the
single most common indication for liver transplantation [1–
3]. Antiviral therapy is effective in more than half of
infected patients, but the actual rate of sustained viral
response depends on viral, host, and adherence factors.
Viral and host factors tend to be nonmodifiable, whereas
interventions may increase adherence.
The current standard of care for hepatitis C therapy is the
combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin [4].
Sustained viral response for antiviral therapy is about 55%
[5•, 6•]. However, adverse effects from antiviral therapy
directly affect treatment adherence and can decrease the
likelihood of a sustained viral response. These complica-
tions can severely compromise quality of life [7]. Both
interferon and ribavirin are associated with signature effects
that are predictable, manageable, and improve with dose
modification or discontinuation [8••]. Rarely is an adverse
effect from hepatitis C antiviral therapy permanent. Ad-
verse effects can arise from both interferon and ribavirin,
and may lead to treatment termination and dose modifica-
tions in 10% to 15% and 32% to 42% of patients,
respectively [5•, 6•, 9]. When interferon and ribavirin doses
are reduced by a certain threshold, the sustained viral
response may also decrease [10]. For instance, the results of
a recent study by Reddy et al. [11••] demonstrated the
sustained viral response is 34% when a patient’s cumulative
ribavirin dose decreases below 60%.
An understanding of the antiviral adverse effects is
essential to effectively deal with adverse effects in a timely
manner. The goal during therapy is to maximize the
likelihood of achieving a sustained viral response while
improving tolerability and maintaining quality of life.
Providers should discuss the potential issues with patients
and with their social support. During clinic follow-up,
patients should be queried about treatment adverse effects.
Many times, the adverse effects can accumulate over time

and lead to early treatment discontinuation. The current
paper reviews the most frequent adverse effects associated
with hepatitis C therapy, and proposes interventions to
ameliorate complications. The adverse effects from pegy-
lated interferon and ribavirin are considered separately.
Pegylated Interferon
The efficacy and therapeutic value of hepatitis C treatment
is dependent on the degree of tolerability and adherence to
the drugs, which in turn are related to the management of
the side effects. The frequency and number of side effects
related to interferon therapy are common, with most clinical
trials reporting at least one interferon-related adverse effect
in 95% of the patient group [5•, 10, 12]. The most
frequently reported adverse effects from interferon include
constitutional, hematologic, neuropsychiatric, and endocri-
nologic complications (Table 1). The onset of the adverse
effects differ. The onset can be from minutes after the
interferon injection, to months (Table 2).
Constitutional Effects
The most common adverse effects from interferon are
constitutional symptoms. The severity of these side effects
is inversely related to the amount of time after the
interferon injection. Fatigue, headache, and fever were each
reported in about 50% to 60% of treated patients [6•, 9, 12].
Constitutional effects can manifest early during therapy,
even after the first dose of interferon [12]. However, several
constitutional effects (e.g., fever) resolve or wane after the
first several injections. Certain precautions can assist with
the effects, such as maintaining adequate hydration and
light to moderate exercise. The suggested intake of water in
ounces is equivalent to half the patient’s body weight in
pounds. To prevent interferon therapy from interfering with
work, injections should occur on Fridays. As a result, most
of the constitutional effects will occur on Saturday. By
Monday, treated patients tend to feel better. The use of
acetaminophen or ibuprofen before the injection can also
ameliorate many of the constitutional adverse effects. Other
adverse effects (e.g., arthralgia) can respond to acetamino-
phen or ibuprofen. However, ibuprofen should be avoided
in patients with liver cirrhosis.
Hematologic Effects
Hematologic side effects are the most recurrent abnormal
laboratory values that can lead to dosage reductions and
premature treatment termination [9]. Because of its myelo-
suppressive effect, interferon can affect hemoglobin, white
blood cell, and platelet values. However, the anemia seen
during combination treatment is mostly associated with
ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia.
The definition of neutropenia varies between the two
commercially available pegylated interferons. For instance,
neutropenia is defined as an absolute neutrophil count less
than 500 cells/mm3
when using pegylated interferon α-2a,
and below 750 cells/mm3
when using pegylated interferon
α-2b [13, 14]. Certain populations appear to be more likely
affected by the neutropenic effects of interferon, such as the

elderly and non-African Americans [15]. Although African
Americans are prone to constitutional neutropenia, initia-
tion of interferon treatment usually only leads to minimal
further decreases in neutrophil count. However, the clinical
impact of neutropenia on significant infection is controversial.
In a study of 119 subjects, 22 infections were documented and
were dominated by sinusitis, pharyngitis, and urinary tract
infections [15].
In most clinical trials, neutropenia is treated with dose
modification. Interferon dose reduction occurs in about
17% to 20% of patients and treatment termination in 2% to
3% of patients [16••, 17, 18]. The rapid decline in
neutrophils usually occurs within the first 2 weeks of
treatment initiation, with stabilization occurring over the
next 4–6 weeks [9]. One study of 25 patients illustrated a
median drop of 21% in neutrophils following the first dose
of interferon [19].
Another option for patients who develop neutropenia
from interferon therapy is the use of granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (GCSF) [20–22]. Few clinical studies
have included the use of GCSF [20, 21]. These studies have
indicated that the GCSF is able to raise neutrophil counts
during interferon therapy. However, the results of a recent
study failed to show a correlation between interferon-
induced neutropenia and incidence or severity of infections
[15]. Thus, although GCSF can improve neutrophil counts,
future studies are required to determine the utility of GCSF
in clinical practice, particularly given its increased costs and
its own associated adverse effects. Regardless of the
intervention of neutropenia, affected patients need regular
cell counts to monitor neutrophil levels.
Another interferon-induced hematologic adverse effect is
thrombocytopenia. Several mechanisms exist for the devel-
opment of thrombocytopenia. It has been shown that
platelet count can fall up to 50% because of posttranscrip-
tional suppression of megakaryopoiesis or platelet seques-
tration in capillaries [23]. In addition, there have been rare
cases of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia leading to
significant decreases in platelet count, which can be
rectified by termination of interferon treatment or cortico-
steroid therapy [24, 25]. Platelet reduction often occurs
within the first 24 h of interferon administration, with nadir
being reached within 8 weeks of therapy. Platelet levels will
then stabilize at this low level during the length of therapy
[23, 24]. However, it may compound the already present
thrombocytopenia associated with cirrhosis and portal
hypertension. With pegylated interferon α-2a, dose
reduction is suggested when platelet counts fall below
50,000/mL and therapy termination when counts fall
below 25,000/mL [13]. The threshold is set a little higher
with respect to pegylated interferon α-2b, with limits of
80,000/mL for dose reduction and 50,000/mL for discontin-
uation [14]. Discontinuation of therapy is often followed by
normalization of platelet counts within 4–8 weeks [23, 24].
Recent studies have shown eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin
receptor agonist, to effectively increase platelet counts to
greater than 250,000/mm3
in thrombocytopenic patients with
hepatitis C virus [26]. However, its safety and utility in
patients with advanced liver disease remains to be deter-
mined, because it may increase the risk of thrombosis [27].
Neuropsychiatric Effects
Not only is the prevalence of depression in patients with
hepatitis C higher than the general population, antiviral
therapy increases the likelihood of a variety of neuropsy-
chiatric complications, including worsening depression,
anxiety, and suicidal ideation [28]. Thus, it is imperative
to assess for underlying depression and other preexisting
psychiatric illness before considering antiviral therapy. In
fact, antiviral therapy is contraindicated in patients with
uncontrolled neuropsychiatric disorders. With a treated
patient’s approval, it is helpful for their social support to
provide feedback on mood changes because patients
themselves may not notice changes in their disposition.
About 20% to 30% of patients treated with interferons
report depression during therapy or the exacerbation of a
preexisting depressive state [6•, 29]. Depending on the type

and severity of neuropsychiatric effects, patients may be
monitored or may be treated with more frequent clinic visits
or telephone calls, antidepressant medications, psychiatric
referral, or dose modification or even discontinuation.
The selection of antidepressant medication requires
tailoring, because depression may have nuances that
improve or worsen with the choice of therapy [30]. The
greatest experience with antidepressant medications is with
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [31, 32].
Although the use of antidepressant medication may not
necessarily significantly improve the likelihood of a
sustained viral response, it does improve adherence and
help maintain quality of life [33]. In patients believed at
increased risk of interferon-associated depression, preemp-
tive treatment with SSRIs was associated with a significant
reduction in the incidence of major depression [33].
Endocrinologic Effects
Thyroid abnormalities are the most commonly associated
interferon-induced endocrinologic adverse effect, occurring
in 1% to 6% of interferon-treated patients [34, 35]. Both
hypo- and hyperthyroidism can develop. Patients with
hepatitis C may be predisposed to developing thyroid
abnormalities because of an increased rate of thyroid
autoantibodies prior to starting antiviral therapy [36]. For
instance, one study described the development of thyroid
disorder in 60% of patients with antithyroid microsome
antibodies present prior to the initiation of interferon
therapy, compared to only 3.3% of patients without these
antibodies [35]. In a similar study, 38.5% of females with
antithyroid peroxidase antibodies developed hypothyroid-
ism versus only 7.8% of females lacking these antibodies
[37].
Thyroid function tests should be obtained at baseline and
every 12 weeks during antiviral treatment, and after
treatment completion. If a patient develops symptomatic
hypothyroidism, hormone replacement should be initiated
while continuing antiviral therapy. Moreover, if the patient
develops hyperthyroidism, the patient should be referred to
an endocrinologist for further management with reevalua-
tion of the antiviral regimen. Similar to the autoantibody
destruction seen in the thyroid, antibodies to the adrenal
cortex, pancreatic islet cells, and antiphospholipid anti-
bodies have been reported with the use of interferon [38,
39]. Although rare, new-onset insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus with the presence of antibodies directed toward
islet cells and insulin has been reported [40].
Dermatologic Effects
Many dermatologic adverse effects are associated with
interferons, with an incidence ranging from 13% to 87%
[5•, 41]. Besides nonspecific symptoms, reactions at the site
of interferon injection are common, with 30% to 40% of
patients complaining of erythema, pruritus, and tenderness
[6•, 42]. Because the lesions may take weeks to resolve, it
is recommended to rotate between unique injection sites.
After injection, the sites are often warm and raised,
expanding to a circumference of 5 cm or more. If the site
continues to enlarge and remains warm and tender, the
patient must be examined for possible abscess formation.
Rarely, infection and skin necrosis are seen at the injection
site. However, these symptoms do not necessarily warrant
termination of treatment.
An additional major complaint from interferon therapy is
skin dryness, which occurs in two of three treated patients
[43]. Skin dryness can be exacerbated in cold weather, and
may be accompanied by intense pruritus. Topical steroids,
emollients, and soothing baths may help to alleviate these
symptoms, but studies have not shown a significant
response [43]. Another typical adverse effect seen with
interferons is alopecia, occurring in about one third of
patients, with a higher prevalence in females [44]. To
combat alopecia, the patient can cut his/her hair short prior to
interferon initiation and avoid pulling, braiding, or vigorously
combing the hair. In addition, patients should avoid the use of
harsh hair-care products, harsh hair dyes, hair dryers, and
other products that may be detrimental to hair growth.
Other Effects
Neurologic, pulmonary, and ophthalmologic adverse effects
associated with interferon use have been reported. Sensory
and autonomic neuropathies, as well as Bell’s palsy, have
been documented with interferon use, most likely arising
from an autoimmune phenomenon or neuronal injury
caused by interferon stimulation of the immune system
[45]. Neuropathy usually resolves with the termination of
interferon treatment, but additional steroids and/or cyclo-
phosphamide may be beneficial [12]. In addition to the
neuropathies stated, there have been rare cases of myasthe-
nia gravis. In such cases, interferon therapy is withdrawn and
pyridostigmine therapy is initiated [46]. During interferon
treatment, multiple pulmonary adverse effects can occur,
such as interstitial pneumonitis, alveolar disease, and
sarcoidosis reactivation. If a patient complains of continual
cough and dyspnea on exertion or rest, a chest radiograph
should be obtained to exclude pneumonitis. Possible bacte-
rial pneumonia should be treated with proper antibiotics in
conjunction with halting antiviral therapy, which can be
reinitiated when there is clinical improvement. Occasionally,
pulmonary function tests may be indicated, including forced
vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, and carbon monox-
ide diffusion capacity, as well as a thoracic CT scan.
Interferon-induced interstitial pneumonitis can be life-
36 Curr Hepatitis Rep (2011) 10:33–40
threatening, although it usually resolves with withdrawal of
interferon. However, the most common cause for cough and
shortness of breath is likely ribavirin-induced [43].
In addition to the pulmonary and neurologic effects,
interferons have been associated with retinopathy (e.g., retinal
hemorrhages and cotton wool spots), particularly in patients
with diabetes [47]. In one study of 63 patients treated with
antiviral therapy, 40% of patients developed retinal hemor-
rhages and 44% developed cotton wool spots [48]. Diabetes
and hypertension were risk factors for retinopathy [47, 49]. It
is important for patients with pre-treatment risk factors for
retinopathy to undergo retinal examination prior to treatment,
and if any visual changes occur during treatment, to undergo
ocular re-evaluation. Antiviral treatment must be halted if
retinopathy worsens during therapy.
Ribavirin
Ribavirin is used with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Like
interferon, it is associated with several adverse effects.
Although the adverse effects from ribavirin appear to be
less severe than those from interferon, maintaining ribavirin
dose appears more critical to the likelihood of achieving a
sustained viral response than sustaining the interferon dose
[6•]. Thus, it is still imperative to understand and be able to
manage ribavirin-associated complications.
Hematologic Effects
The signature adverse effect of ribavirin is anemia, occurring
in up to 30% of treated individuals [5•, 6•]. Ribavirin-related
anemia is one the most common reasons for dosage
reduction or discontinuation of the drug, resulting in 9% to
22% of patients requiring dosage reduction [5•, 6•]. Anemia
can result in persistent fatigue, shortness of breath, and lower
quality-of-life scores [12]. Treatment with ribavirin displays
a drop in hemoglobin during the first 4 weeks of treatment,
followed by stabilization, then normalization after treatment
completion [9]. The mechanism of ribavirin-associated
hemolytic anemia is unclear, but is believed to be related
to impaired antioxidant defenses and red blood cell oxidative
damages through its metabolites [51]. The degree of
hemolytic anemia is directly related to ribavirin dose, renal
function, and perhaps patient age [52, 53]. Recently, ITPA
gene variants have been found to be protective of anemia in
patients treated with ribavirin [54••].
The definition of anemia can vary. Although anemia may
be suggested by the rate of hemoglobin drop, it is commonly
defined by an absolute value of less than 10 g/dL [55].
Intervention for ribavirin-induced anemia depends on the rate
of hemoglobin decrease, absolute hemoglobin value, comor-
bidities, and symptoms. Therapeutic options include frequent
monitoring, blood transfusion, erythropoietin grown factor,
and ribavirin dose modification [6•, 8••, 50••]. The risk of
significant anemia can be predicted by hemoglobin trends.
For instance, a decrease in hemoglobin of at least of 1.5 g/dL
after 2 weeks predicts significant decreases after 4 weeks of
therapy [56]. Recognition of impending anemia may prompt
small reductions of ribavirin to avoid significant decline in
hemoglobin.
There is a discrepancy between the intervention for
anemia according to package inserts, and what is often done
in clinical practice. The respective package inserts recom-
mend decreasing the ribavirin dose by 200 mg/day when
using peginterferon α-2b/ribavirin and by 600 mg/day
when using peginterferon α-2a/ribavirin, if hemoglobin
decreases to less than 10 g/dL in a patient without cardiac
risk factors [13, 14, 55]. The package inserts also
recommend termination of ribavirin if the hemoglobin
levels decrease below 8.5 g/dL.
Studies have shown erythropoietin can improve hemo-
globin values, maintain ribavirin dosage levels, and
improve quality of life in patients with symptomatic
ribavirin-induced anemia [57]. Despite improved adherence
with erythropoietin, no studies have shown that the use of
erythropoietin translates to higher sustained viral response.
This may be due to the large cohort of treated patients needed to
show a beneficial effect. There have been reported cases of
antibody-mediated pure red-cell aplasia induced by erythro-
poietin, which is potentially life-threatening, but resolves with
termination of erythropoietin treatment and initiation of danazol
[58]. A recent study highlighted the correlation between the
magnitude of hemoglobin decline and the likelihood of
sustained viral response, and indicated an association between
the magnitude of hemoglobin decline and ribavirin exposure
[59]. Erythropoietin use in early-onset anemia minimized
treatment discontinuation and led to higher sustained viral
response rates. However, erythropoietin for anemia after
8 weeks of therapy was not associated with higher sustained
viral response rates. Moreover, erythropoietin has been linked
to a greater incidence of mortality with its use in ischemic
stroke patients [60]. These recent concerns regarding raised
risks of thromboembolic events and aplastic anemia with
erythropoietin justify the judicious use of this agent.
Other Effects
Other ribavirin-associated complications include nausea and
pulmonary, dermatologic, and teratogenic effects. Studies
have shown that 25% to 40% of patients complain of nausea
[5•, 6•, 12]. However, this symptom can be managed with
alterations in the patient’s dietary regimen. More specifically,
along with maintaining adequate hydration, patients should
avoid acidic, spicy, sweet, or greasy foods. Instead, dietary
intake should consist of clear beverages and dry foods (e.g.,
Curr Hepatitis Rep (2011) 10:33–40 37
toast and crackers). If nausea persists after dietary changes,
antiemetics may be prescribed.
Ribavirin therapy is often associated with a dry, nonpro-
ductive cough, which resolves only upon termination of
treatment. Most patients can tolerate this adverse effect, and
thus it is not a major cause of dose reductions or treatment
termination. However, if the cough becomes productive or
other clinical indications are present, a chest radiograph
should be considered.
The addition of ribavirin in combination therapy increases
the incidence of dermatologic adverse effects. More specifi-
cally, one study compared the incidence of skin rash in two
groups, one receiving interferon monotherapy and one receiv-
ing interferon and ribavirin. Monotherapy resulted in an 8%
incidence, whereas combination therapy resulted in 28%
incidence [41]. Dermatologic side effects with combination
therapy are typified by generalized pruritus, skin xerosis, and
eczematiform lesions, which are localized to the extremities.
Although ribavirin is shown to increase the incidence of
dermatologic conditions when added to interferon treatment, it
should be noted that ribavirin alone may cause rash and
pruritus. Ribavirin must be discontinued if an acute hyper-
sensitivity reaction develops. However, transient rashes do not
require ribavirin treatment interruption [55]. Management
entails topical corticosteroids, which may be tapered once
signs of inflammation and irritation begin to recede. Preven-
tive measures can be taken, with daily emollient therapy and
skin moisturizers to commonly affected areas.
Ribavirin has been associated with significant teratogenic
or embryocidal effects in nonhuman animal species exposed
to it; therefore, patients must take proper precautions when
beginning ribavirin treatment. Moreover, ribavirin therapy,
which according to the Food and Drug Administration is
pregnancy category X, is contraindicated in pregnant woman
and in the male partners of women who are pregnant. It is
imperative for patients to avoid pregnancy during ribavirin
treatment and for 6 months after treatment completion. It is
suggested that two reliable forms of effective contraception be
used during this time. Upon cessation of treatment, recovery
from ribavirin-induced testicular toxicity was apparent within
one or two spermatogenesis cycles. Although human studies
are lacking, there is a ribavirin pregnancy registry that enrolls
pregnant women who have been directly or indirectly exposed
to ribavirin [61]. Although underpowered, the results of a
recent registry questioned the association between ribavirin
and human teratogenicity [62].
Conclusions
The current standard of care for the treatment of hepatitis C
infection involves the use of pegylated interferon and
ribavirin. This antiviral combination therapy is associated
with several potentially serious adverse effects. Fortunately,
pegylated interferon and ribavirin have been available for
almost a decade, and most of the adverse effects regarding
incidence and time of onset have been defined. The
management of these antiviral complications has also been
well described, including preventive and empiric strategies.
Understanding the limitations of current treatment is
essential to assure quality of life and adherence during
therapy, and may provide insight to deal with the finer
points of future treatment strategies.
