Abstract: T10B9.1A-31/MEDI-500 is a nonmitogenic immunoglobulin M kappa murine
monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the alpha-beta (αβ) heterodimer of the
T-lymphocyte receptor complex. The hybridoma was first produced by fusing spleen cells from
BALB/C mice immunized with human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes with SP2/O-Ag14
mutant myeloma cells. The mAb is produced and purified using multistep ion exchange and
molecular sieve chromatography protocols. T10B9 has been used successfully to treat acute
cellular rejection in renal transplantation and as an immunosuppression induction agent in heart
and simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation. Because T10B9 is nonmitogenic and causes
minimal cytokine release, both treatment of rejection and induction of immunosuppression
were accomplished with significantly fewer and milder untoward effects (cytokine release
syndrome) than its comparator OKT3. Since T10B9 is directed against the αβ heterodimer of
the CD3 epitope, it spares the gamma delta (γδ) region. These gamma delta (γδ) T cells have
a unique role in the immune response controlling many serious human diseases and perhaps
facilitating the development of immunologic tolerance. T10B9 has a relatively short duration
of action, depleting T cells for only 10 to 14 days, unlike the protracted depletion seen with
thymoglobulin and Campath-1H. There is no B-lymphocyte depletion with T10B9 as there is
with both of the aforementioned reagents. The lack of prolonged lymphocyte depletion may
account for less infection observed with T10B9 treatment.

Introduction
Induction of immunosuppression has become a standard therapy in the United States
with over 70% of transplantation programs using agents to inhibit the first rejection
response. The drugs most often used fall into three categories; 1) the interleukin-2
anti-CD25 selective blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAb) such as basiliximab
and daclizumab, 2) polyclonal antisera against T-lymphocytes such as rabbit
antilymphocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin) or 3) the mAb alemtuzumab (Campath-1H)
which targets T and B cells. The latter two agents have significant effects on B-cells.
After an initial dose of 30 mg, Campath-1H profoundly suppresses T-cells for up to
330 days and B-cells for 90 to 150 days. Thymoglobulin significantly suppresses
T-cells for up to 90 days and has a profound anti-B-cell effect from 15 to 980 days,
opening many windows for opportunistic infection. (Figure 1).1–11
Clearly there would
be an advantage for a shorter acting immunosuppression agent which allows T-cell
recovery, has little or no effect on B cells and, therefore, does not produce profound
long-term immunosuppression.

OKT3, the first mAb shown to be effective in treating
acute cellular rejection, is such a short-acting agent;
however, it causes significant adverse events including
those related to its mitogenicity and marked stimulation
of inflammatory cytokines. T10B9.1A-31/MEDI-500 is a
short-acting but murine immunoglobulin M kappa (IgMκ)
mAb that is nonmitogenic in vitro which was developed
at the University of Kentucky. The purpose of this review
is to discuss T10B9.1A-31 (T10B9) briefly describing its
manufacturing process, state its known mechanism of action
with comparison to OKT3, give a synopsis of T10B9’s
clinical efficacy, discuss the ability of T10B9 therapy to
spare γδ T cells which may be important in infection and
in the development of tolerance; and finally to support the
thesis that a shorter acting more selective anti-T-lymphocyte
monoclonal antibody may be a better choice for induction of
immunosuppression and/or treatment of acute rejection.
Manufacturing process
T10B9.1A-31 is a nonmitogenic IgMκ isotype murine mAb.
It was produced by fusing spleen cells from BALB/C mice
immunized with human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes
with SP2-0/Ag-14 mutant myeloma cells. After preliminary
screening and cloning three times by limiting dilution, it was
determinedthatT10B9wasdirectedatamonomorphicantigen
expressed on all post-thymic peripheral blood T-cells, but not
on other circulating cells or cell precursors. With the help of
the College of Pharmacy at the University of Kentucky, the
initial production, purification, and lyophilization of stable
clinical material was achieved and approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for T-cell depletion under
BB-IND-4279. Although the first lot of T10B9 was extracted
from mouse ascites, subsequent lots were produced in vitro
and purified with proprietary multistep ion exchange and
molecular sieve chromatography protocols. The final product
exhibited 95%–100% protein purity using SDS-PAGE analy-
sis and passed the FDA recommended testing for bacterial,
fungal, and viral sterility, general safety and pyrogen.12–14
T10B9: Proposed mechanism of action
The therapeutic effectiveness of unmodified murine anti-T
cell mAb in reversing acute human allograft rejection is
dependent on the combination of both antibody isotype and
idiotype interactions with their respective ligands or epitopes.
The most successful are those specific for the CD3/TCR αβ
antigen recognition complex.15
The mechanism of OKT3
action (a murine IgG2a mAb) includes interaction of its Fc
portion with the high affinity Fc gamma receptor I that is
present on monocytes. This produces immune activation
followed by immunosuppression. T10B9, a murine IgMκ
isotype, is specific for the TCR αβ heterodimer region of the
CD3 complex, does not react with Fc gamma receptor I and
thus exhibits reduced immune stimulation and the cytokine
release syndrome. The TCR αβ specificity of T10B9 is
defined by its ability to modulate the αβ but not the γδ TCR
whereas OKT3 modulates both types of CD3 T cell receptors.
Since T10B9 is directed against the αβ TCR and OKT3
against the CD3 ε (Epsilon) part of the CD3 complex, they
differ idiotypically. They are isotypically different as well
because T10B9 is an IgMκ and OKT3 is an IgG2a murine
isotype. Therefore, human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA)
directed against one monoclonal antibody does not neutralize
the other mAb; they are not cross-reactive. Indeed, patients
with allograft rejection not responding to therapy with one
monoclonal antibody have successfully been treated with
the alternative agent.16
Attempts to fully humanize T10B9
have been unsuccessful to date; however, there is a chimeric
mAb which appears to be comparable to the parent compound
in vitro (JST, personal communication).

T10B9 induces short-term lymphocyte
depletion
T10B9 administration results in a rapid decline in lymphoid
cell counts with respective epitope modulation and
recovery by day 14. (Figure 2) This is in marked contrast
to thymoglobulin and Campath-1H and may be one reason
why infections may occur over many months when either of
these agents are administered (Figure 1).
T10B9 does not induce proliferation
OKT3 is an established potent T cell mitogen in vivo
and in vitro whereas studies suggest that T10B9 reduces
proliferation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
In vitro studies were performed to compare the ability of
T10B9 and OKT3 to induce proliferation and to determine
whether T10B9 in high concentrations or cross-linked on
plastic remained incapable of inducing proliferation. The
response of PBMC from five normal donors was tested
after day 3 of culture. Soluble T10B9 at doses as high as
10 mcg/mL were non-mitogenic, while soluble OKT3 is a
potent mitogen even at low doses.15
Cytokine release
In vitro
In order to compare the ability of both T10B9 and OKT3
to induce cytokine secretion, the in vitro production of
cytokines by PBMC from normal donors was determined.
OKT3 (20 ng/mL) strongly stimulated tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNFα), interferon-γ (INFγ), interleukin-2 (IL-2),
and IL-6 release whereas T10B9 (160 ng/mL) failed to induce
detectible cytokine release from PBMC over a six-day test
period. In a dose escalation study, T10B9 at doses of 80, 800,
and 8000 ng/mL failed to induce TNFα release at 24 hours
after exposure.15
In vivo
Plasma samples from kidney transplantation patients rejecting
their allograft and undergoing monoclonal MAb antibody
therapy were tested for cytokine levels. Samples collected
under informed consent two hours following the first dose
of either T10B9 or OKT3 underwent ELISA quantitation
of TNFα, INFγ, IL-2, and IL-6. Of significance, only six of
30 patients treated with T10B9 exhibited a TNFα response

compared to 19 of 23 OKT3-treated patients (P = 0.001).
Likewise the T10B9 group exhibited a significantly lower
INFγ response; however, there was no statistical difference
observed in the IL-2 or IL-6 response (Figure 3).15
Induction of activation antigens
Incubation of PBMC with either T10B9 or OKT3 reveals
a difference in the in vitro expression of CD69, CD71
(transferrin receptor), CD25 (P55 Il-2 receptor), and DR
activation antigens. OKT3 and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)
induce expression of all activation antigens tested. None
of the PBMC donors tested exhibited CD25 or DR antigen
expression following incubation with 10 or 50 µg/mL of
T10B9. At 50 µg/mL (molar equivalent of 10 mcg/mL
OKT3) T10B9 did not induce CD69 or CD71 expression.15
Induction of apoptosis and IL-2
release in Sup-T13 cells
The ability of OKT3 to induce program cell death (apoptosis)
has been well documented. Accordingly, the ability of T10B9
to induce apoptosis in the αβ T-cell line Sup-T13 after
20 hours of incubation was compared to OKT3 using DNA
fragmentation analysis and dexamethasone as the positive
control. Both T10B9 and OKT3 induced the DNA frag-
mentation definitive for apoptosis. The degree of apoptosis
was quantitated using flow cytometric methods. The media
control exhibited 18% apoptotic MC540 positive cells. This
was increased to 38% following T10B9 incubation and 43%
with OKT3. The secretion of IL-2 by the Sup-T13 cell line
was also determined following T10B9 or OKT3 stimulation.
T10B9 proved to be a weaker stimulus for IL-2 than did
OKT3. However, T10B9 had the ability to generate a cellular
signal as confirmed by the induction of apoptosis and IL-2
release in the human T-cell line Sup-T13.15
T10B9 in clinical solid organ
transplantation
T10B9 has been used successfully to treat acute cellular rejec-
tion in renal transplantation.16–18
In a phase 2 clinical trial of 81
kidney recipients transplanted at the University of Kentucky,
T10B9 provided treatment for biopsy proven acute cellular
rejection equal to that of OKT3 with fewer untoward effects,
less cytokine release and cytokine nephropathy. Compared
to OKT3, serum creatinine began falling after two days of
T10B9 therapy instead of three days and the peak serum
creatinine rise seen with OKT3 therapy was not present
(Figure 4). Consistent with its lack of mitogenicity, there was
significantly less cytokine (TNFα and INFγ) release seen after
T10B9 administration (Figure 4). Additionally in the T10B9
treated patients there were fewer serious infections, no PTLD
and no significant increase in the development of HAMA.18
T10B9 has been successfully used as an immunosup-
pression induction agent in heart transplantation19
and in
simultaneous kidney–pancreas transplantation.20
T10B9 is
also used for T-lymphocyte depletion in harvested bone
marrow prior to haploidentical bone marrow transplantation
to control graft versus host disease.12,13
Unlike other
monoclonal and polyclonal antibody preparations, there is no
experience in treating acute leukemia or aplastic anemia.
T10B9 specificity for αβ TCR
and for sparing γδ T-cells
T10B9 is specific for the T cell αβ heterodimer region of
the CD3 epitope. It modulates the αβ but not the γδ TCR
whereas OKT3 binds to the ε (epsilon) portion of the CD3
and modulates the entire epitope. Flow cytometry confirms
the absence of αβ + T cells after both T10B9 and OKT3
induced modulation; however, after T10B9 administration
the γδ T-cells persist (Figure 5). The sparing of γδ T cells was
also confirmed in a multicenter bone marrow depletion trial
sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.
Discussion
Since the onset of human organ transplantation, many new
drugs have been added to improve transplantation outcome.
In addition to the small molecule shorter acting staples of
maintenance immunosuppression that include corticoste-
roids, calcineurin inhibitors, purine synthesis and mTOR
T10B9 is nonmitogenic and causes minimal
cytokine (TNFα and IFNγ) release producing
fewer and milder untoward effects

inhibitors, biologicals, both monoclonal and polyclonal, have
been increasingly used for induction of immunosuppression
and treatment of rejection. The addition of these drugs has
greatly reduced acute rejection and, in most cases, improved
long-term graft survival, albeit there is an increased incidence
of cytopenias, renal insufficiency, neurological complica-
tions, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, infection complications,
and PTLD.
T10B9 is a novel mAb, with a short duration of activity
allowing phenotypically altered T lymphocytes to repopu-
late after therapy, has no effect on B lymphocytes, is not
mitogenic and therefore produces fewer cytokine induced
side effects and appears to have less propensity toward
infectious complications. One of the unique characteristics
of T10B9 is its specificity for only those T lymphocytes
that express the αβ T-cell receptor (TCR αβ). Generally αβ
T lymphocytes compose between 95% and 98% of all T-cells
in the peripheral blood. The remainder are T lymphocytes
that express only the γδ TCR. In both mice and in humans,
γδ T lymphocytes are primarily located in proximity to
epithelial tissues, including the skin, bowel and lung – all
areas of the body that have early contact with the external
environment.21,22
These γδ T cells play a major role in host
first-line defense against bacteria, viruses, and fungi.23–29
An
important function that differs from the αβ T lymphocyte
population is the ability of γδ T lymphocytes to recognize and
respond to such stimuli without the requirement for antigen
processing and presentation by accessory cells. In this regard
they contribute to innate immunity, ie, the ability to react
quickly without requiring prior antigen processing.
Another important feature of their “first-line defense” is
well documented in the skin. When skin is injured by any
mechanism, a population of γδ T lymphocytes called den-
dritic epidermal T cells (DETC) responds quickly to injury
and attach to keratinocytes (the primary cells of the skin).
These DETC’s secrete pre-growth factors (keratitic growth
factors 1 and 2 and insulin growth factor 1) that stimulate
regrowth of the epithelium. This phenomenon has been
demonstrated in murine lung and is presumed to occur when
injury occurs to any epithelial tissue. exposure to mild immune
response. This capacity allows γδ T lymphocytes to control
a variety of infectious agents, such as Nocardia asteroids,
Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium bovis, Bordatella per-
tussis, etc.21,22,30

infected with viruses.21,22,24,31
Gamma/delta T lymphocytes
are also able to modulate inflammatory responses in situ, ie,
they can directly recognize molecules induced on epithelial
cells by stress and respond very rapidly. They can also control
the host immune response and thereby present or limit the
immunopathology that may occur if there is a sustained
response to the initial stress. Taken together it is clear that
the γδ T lymphocytes are actually a critical component of the
immunesystemwithparticularreferencetothecontrolofmany
opportunistic infections and the maintenance of homeostasis.
Currently, the drugs used for immunosuppression induction
or the treatment of rejection suppress both the αβ and the γδ
T lymphocytespopulations.Forexample,Thymoglobulin®
not
only suppresses T lymphocytes but also B lymphocytes and
Campath-1H suppresses T and B lymphocytes and monocytes.
There have only been two monoclonal antibodies that uniquely
target the αβ TCR, T10B9 and BMA 031. These two differ by
the fact that BMA 031 is mitogenic and T10B9 is not. Hence,
their toxicity profiles are quite different.
Studies have not been performed to demonstrate that
sparing γδ T lymphocytes makes a difference in solid organ
transplantation outcome. Increased γδ T cells 100 days
post-bone marrow transplantation predict a long-term
favorable outcome. However, the direct evidence that sparing
γδ T lymphocytes is beneficial to transplant outcome is
mostly derived from the reported experience using T10B9
for T cell depletion of donor marrow/stem cells at several
centers23,33,34
and in solid organ transplantation trials where
the overall infection rate was only 16.7%.16,17,19
This compares
favorably to induction with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin
(Thymoglobulin®
) versus basiliximab (Simulect®
) where the
rate of all infections at 12 months was reportedly 85.8% and
75.2%, respectively.35
The studies above suggest that γδ T cells appear to be
important in the control of many serious human diseases,
most of which unfortunately accompany immunosuppression.
These cells also appear to have the capability to facilitate
the development of immunologic tolerance. These are
features that could be maximized by using T10B9 for both
transplant immunosuppression induction and for treatment of
rejection. Parenthetically, T10B9 may be particularly useful
in composite tissue transplantation. This hypothesis is based
on the observation of Siemionow and others36–38
that an anti-
rat Mab directed only at the a/b chains of the T-cell receptor
T10B9 specifically binds with the αβ chains
and spares the γδ chains of the T-cell receptor

was critically important for the development of long term
tolerance to allogeneic composite transplants. Thus, sparing
γδ T lymphocytes may provide an important benefit in stem
cell and solid organ transplantation.
In summary, T10B9 (MEDI-500) is a murine IgMκ
anti-human T cell monoclonal antibody with reduced immune
activation potential both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro it does
not induce DNA synthesis, the expression of activation
antigens or cytokine release, which is in contrast to OKT3.
Clinically T10B9 is effective in the reversal of acute renal
allograft rejection, exhibits lower morbidity and induces
lower TNFα and INFγ levels after infusion. Finally, it spares
γδ T lymphocytes which have a unique and important role
in the immune response; ie, in controlling many serious
human diseases while inducing αβ T cell immunosuppression
and perhaps facilitating the development of immunologic
tolerance. Given the apparent advantages of T10B9 over
currently available polyclonal and monoclonal reagents,
would a shorter acting immunosuppressive agent be a better
therapeutic choice? Is it time for a paradigm shift?
