Overuse and abuse of antibiotics can increase the risk of cancer.
Chloramphenicol can inhibit both bacterial and mitochondrial
protein synthesis, causing mitochondrial stress and decreased ATP
biosynthesis. Chloramphenicol can accelerate cancer progression;
however, the underlying mechanisms of chloramphenicol in
carcinogenesis and cancer progression are still unclear. We found
that chloramphenicol can induce matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP)-13 expression and increase MMP-13 protein in conditioned
medium, resulting in an increase in cancer cell invasion.
Chloramphenicol also activated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK)
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt signaling, leading
to c-Jun protein phosphorylation. The activated c-Jun protein has
been proven to activate binding to the MMP-13 promoter and also
upregulate the amount of MMP-13. Both the SP 600125 (JNK
inhibitor) and LY 294002 (PI-3K/Akt inhibitor) can inhibit
chloramphenicol-induced c-Jun phosphorylation, MMP-13 expres-
sion, and cell invasion. Overexpression of the dominant-negative
JNK and PI-3K p85 subunit also negate chloramphenicol-induced
responses. Other antibiotics that cause mitochondrial stress and
a decrease in ATP biosynthesis also induce MMP-13 expression.
These ﬁndings suggest that chloramphenicol-induced PI-3K/Akt,
JNK phosphorylation, and activator protein 1 activation might
function as a novel mitochondrial stress signal that result in an
increase of MMP-13 expression and MMP-13-associated cancer cell
invasion. The ﬁndings of this study conﬁrms that chloramphenicol,
and other 70S ribosomal inhibitors, should be administered with
caution, especially during cancer therapy.

Chloramphenicol, extracted from Streptomyces venezuelae,
is an antibiotic with a small molecular size and highly lipid
soluble. Chloramphenicol is indicated for the treatment of
wound healing and ocular infections. Chloramphenicol reaches
therapeutic concentrations in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid and is used
for the treatment of meningitis in the third-world countries.
Also, it is used as the last-line defense for multiple drug-resistant
organisms, such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus
(Hammett-Stabler and Johns, 1998). Aside from its pharmaceu-
tical application, chloramphenicol has become a major contam-
inant in farmed seafood (especially shrimps, crab, and ﬁsh). Due
to the fact that some farmed seafood contain excessive
chloramphenicol residue, new concerns about its toxicity have
been raised. Adverse effects caused by overdose and overuse of
chloramphenicol include aplastic anemia, gray baby syndrome,
and leukemogenesis (Hammett-Stabler and Johns, 1998; Holt
et al., 1993; Robin et al., 1981). In a mouse T-cell model,
chloramphenicol induced abnormal cell differentiation and
inhibited apoptosis, leading to the development of leukemia-
like syndrome (Yuan and Shi, 2008). Based on epidemiologic
studies, chloramphenicol did not contribute to carcinogenesis
when applied topically. However, its causal association with
leukemia, especially through systemic use, was probably not
adequately tested in these studies (Smith et al., 2000). From
a thorough review by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer, chloramphenicol is listed as a probable carcinogen to
humans (Group 2A). The underlying mechanism of chloram-
phenicol in human solid-tumor progression is still unclear.
Chloramphenicol reversibly binds to the 50S subunit of the
70S ribosome, inhibiting peptidyl transferase in both prokaryotic
organisms and mitochondria (Balbi, 2004). In histopathological
studies, chloramphenicol-stressed mitochondria showed mor-
phological and functional deterioration (Duewelhenke et al.,
2007). Mitochondrial damage is an important contributor to
human aging and aging-related diseases. Thus, we assumed that
chloramphenicol-treated somatic cells may show senescence-
related phenotypes. In 2005, we found that chloramphenicol
caused senescence-associated morphological changes and se-
nescence biomarker SA-bGal activation in somatic cancer cells
(Li et al., 2005). Besides morphological alteration, senescent
cells often exhibit cell cycle blockage, decreased sensitivity to
growth factors and apoptosis stimulators, and changes in their

gene expression pattern. A study using complementary DNA
(cDNA) array showed that a variety of genes involved in cell
cycle regulation, cytoskeleton, stress response, and metabolism
are altered during senescence (Kang et al., 2003).
Upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) during
senescence may contribute to matrix degradation and senescent
phenotype appearance (Kang et al., 2003). MMPs are a group
of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. It has been demonstrated
that MMPs participate in several physiological (including
embryonic development and wound healing) and pathological
events (rheumatoid arthritis and tumor metastasis) (Kuzuya and
Iguchi, 2003; Leeman et al., 2002). At least 23 different MMPs
have been identiﬁed in humans. MMPs have been classiﬁed
into gelatinases, collagenases, stromelysins, and membrane-
type MMPs. The MMP-13 (also called collagenase-3) can
hydrolyze collagen types I, II, III, IV, X, and XIV; gelatin;
aggrecan; tenascin C; and ﬁbronectin (Kna¨uper et al., 1997a;
Leeman et al., 2002). Because of its proteolytic potency and
wide substrate speciﬁcity, the expression of MMP-13 is
restricted to speciﬁc tissues, including human ﬁbroblasts,
keratinocytes, and solid-tumor cells (Kna¨uper et al., 1997a).
High levels of MMP-13 often correlate with malignant tumor
invasion, suggesting an important role for MMP-13 in tumor
progression (Kna¨uper et al., 1997a; Leeman et al., 2002).
The rationale of the study is to verify chloramphenicol-induced
senescence-like responses, especially the mitochondria-to-nucleus
stress signals and MMP expression in chloramphenicol-treated
H1299 cells. We found that chloramphenicol treatment activates
PI-3 kinase/Akt/c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) signaling and
increases nuclear c-Jun activity, which contribute to MMP-13
expression and H1299 cell invasion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents, cell culture, and treatments. All chemicals used were of
analytical grade and, unless otherwise indicated, were purchased from Sigma
(St Louis, MO). Chloramphenicol was dissolved in ethanol, prepared freshly,
and protected from light. The solvent content was < 5 ll/ml in all experiments.
The H1299 (non–small-cell lung cancer), HepG2 (hepatocarcinoma), A549
(lung adenocarcinoma), and HaCaT cell (immortalized keratinocyte) were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM), supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and cultured in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Transient transfection of dominant-negative-JNK and DN p85. H1299
cells were seeded in complete medium in six-well plates for 24 h before
transfection. Cells were transfected with 2-lg plasmid DNA containing
dominant-negative (DN) JNK (a gift from Dr H.-F. Yang-Yen, Institute of
Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, Taiwan) or DN p85 (d-p85; a gift from
Dr W. M. Fu, Institute of Pharmacology, National Taiwan University, Taiwan)
using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in serum-free
medium, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The medium was replaced
with complete medium 6 h later. Cells were then incubated for another 24 h and
were then exposed to chloramphenicol.
Cellular ATP content measurement. Total cellular ATP levels were
determined by ATP-bioluminescent assay. Cell lysate was prepared as describe
in the manufacturer’s protocol (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Each reaction
was performed by mixing 5–10 ll lysates in 90 ll reaction buffer in a 96-well
plate. Finally, luciferase and its substrates were added and luminescence
intensity was counted immediately, using a luminometer (TopCount; Packard,
Ramsey, MN) calibrated with appropriate ATP standards.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription–PCR, and real-time quantitative
PCR. Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-
phenol-chloroform extraction as described previously (Li et al., 2005). To
analyze MMP messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, reverse transcription
(RT)-PCR were performed by evaluating MMP mRNA content and that of
a housekeeping gene, b-actin, as an internal control. In brief, the ﬁrst strand
cDNA was synthesized from 3 lg total RNA at 42°C for 60 min. Speciﬁc
MMP cDNAs were ampliﬁed as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for
30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s and a ﬁnal 10 min extension at 72°C. The
PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, with
ethidium bromide staining. The PCR primer sets for MMPs and b-actin are
listed in Supplementary table 1.
The real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and quantitative measurements were
performed with SYBR-Green PCR Mix essentially as described by the
manufacturer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For MMP-13, the RT-PCR primer set
was purchased from SABiosciences (Frederick, MD). Normalized expression
levels were then calculated using the starting levels of b-actin in each sample to
normalize for differences in total RNA content in individual samples.
Nuclear protein extraction. Nuclear extracts were prepared using nuclear
and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL). According to the
manufacturer’s protocol, cell monolayer on 100-mm dishes were scraped and
resuspended in cytoplasmic extraction reagent by repetitive pipetting. The
cytosolic fraction was separated by centrifugation (15,000 3 g, 5 min). The
nuclear protein was extracted with nuclear extraction reagent by intermittently
vortexing over 40 min.
Western blots. To evaluate the MMP-13 content in the culture medium,
serum-free DMEM-conditioned medium was collected and precipitated with
10% trichloroacetic acid at 4°C for 30 min (Ahmed et al., 2003). The
precipitated proteins were separated by centrifugation (14,000 3 g) and
redissolved in 23 sample buffer (125mM Tris/HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerin,
b-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8) and boiled for
10 min. To obtain total cellular protein extracts, a cell monolayer was washed
with PBS and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (50mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 1%
Nonidet P-40, 150mM NaCl, 1mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid, 1mM NaF,
1mM Na3VO4, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail). The protein concentration
was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by
10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. For immunodetection, the PVDF
membrane was blocked in nonfat milk and incubated in Tris-buffered saline
with Tween-20 (TBST) with antibodies speciﬁc to Erk, phospho-Erk, p38-
MAPK, phospho-p38-MAPK, Akt, phospho-Akt, JNK, phospho-JNK, and
phospho-cJun (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), MMP-13 (BioVision), and b-actin
(Sigma). For chemiluminescent detection, blots were incubated with horserad-
ish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 in TBST) for 2 h at
room temperature, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection,
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (PerkinElmer).
In vitro invasion assay. The in vitro invasion assay was carried out in
transwell plates with 8-lm pores. Each transwell was precoated with 25–30 ll
diluted Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Belford, MA) (1:3 dilution with serum-free
DMEM) as described previously (Yagel et al., 1989). H1299 (2.5 3 104
cells
per well) or A549 (5 3 104
cells per well) was seeded on top of the Matrigel
layer and incubated for 12–48 h. Noninvading cells and the Matrigel layer were
removed using a cotton bud and the migrated cells, attached to the lower
membrane, were ﬁxed by immersion in 4% formaldehyde for 3 min. Finally,
the invading cells were counterstained with 0.05% crystal violet and counted.
Lung colonization assay. Experimental in vivo metastatic potential of the
H1299 (with or without chloramphenicol treatment) was measured by the lung
CHLORAMPHENICOL INDUCES MMP-13 EXPRESSION 141
colonization assay (Kim et al., 2009). Cells used for injection were grown to
subconﬂuence, treated with chloramphenicol for 24 h, trypsinized, washed, and
single-cell suspensions were prepared in serum-free DMEM. The cell
suspensions (5 3 104
single cells/0.2 ml DMEM) were injected into the tail
vein of 4- to 6-week-old male mice. C57BL/6J mice were obtained from
National Taiwan University Animal Center and housed aseptically in the
animal facilities. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Twenty days later,
the mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and sacriﬁced. The lungs were ﬁxed
with Bouin’s solution, and metastatic colonies on the lung surface were counted
macroscopically.
Gelatin zymography. The enzymatic activity of MMP-13 was assayed by
gelatin zymography (Yoon et al., 2002). Conditioned medium was mixed with
sample buffer without reducing agent. The sample was loaded into a gelatin
(1 mg/ml)-containing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electro-
phoresis, the gel was washed twice in washing buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4;
150mM NaCl; and 2.5% Triton X-100) for 30 min and then incubated in
incubation buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 150mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3,
10mM CaCl2, and 1lM ZnCl2) at 37°C. After 12 h of incubation, the gel was
stained with 0.1% Coomassie brilliant R-250 in 50% methanol and 10% acetic
acid for 30 min and destained with staining solution without Coomassie
brilliant R-250. The clear zone of gelatin digestion indicated the presence of
MMP protein.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. The assay was performed using the
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) kit (Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, NY).
Living cells were treated with formaldehyde to generate protein-DNA cross-
links. Then, sheer chromatin (with an average DNA fragment size to ~500 base
pairs) was prepared by repeated sonication. The extract was divided to INPUT
and ChIP portions. Anti-phospho-cJun IgG (Catalog sc-822; Santa Cruz) were
added to the ChIP portions at 1:100 dilution for immunoprecipitation. The
nonspeciﬁc IgG was used as a negative control. The immunocomplexes were
pulled down by protein A/Sepharose and washed out of the nonspeciﬁc
binding. The cross-links in the immunoprecipitated chromatin were reversed by
heating overnight with proteinase K at 65°C. The DNA was puriﬁed by phenol/
chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The puriﬁed ChIP-captured
DNA of samples and of input DNA samples were ampliﬁed by the PCR
method as described before. The following oligonucleotides: 5#-CACCCACAT-
CAGGAACCCCCCATC-3#, 5#-GAGGAAGACCTCCAGTTTGCA GAG-3#
(MMP-13) and 5#-GATATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGTCGAC-3#, 5#-ACCATCAC
GCCCTGGTGCCTGGGG-3# (b-actin) were used for PCR detection.
Statistical analysis. All data were expressed as mean ± SD from at least
three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using
Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA, and values of p < 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Chloramphenicol Caused Mitochondrial Stress, ATP
Restriction, and Increased Cancer Cell Invasion
Chloramphenicol testing dosages (10–100 lg/ml) used in
these studies were without cytotoxicity in MTT assay (Supple-
mentary ﬁg. 1). The clinical dosage of chloramphenicol normally
used against infectious diseases is 10–30 lg/ml in serum, which
corresponds to a dose of 50–100 mg/kg/day (Balbi, 2004).
Chloramphenicol inhibited mitochondrial protein translation
(Fig. 1A), caused mitochondrial stress, and decreased ATP
biosynthesis (Fig. 1B) in H1299 cells in a dose-dependent
manner. A transwell assay showed that the ATP-restricted cell
condition could promote cancer cell invasion (Fig. 1C).
Chloramphenicol Induced MMP-13 mRNA Expression in
Cancer Cells and Facilitated Cancer Cell Invasion
The mRNA levels of MMPs were analyzed by RT-PCR
in chloramphenicol-treated H1299 cells. Cellular MMP-3

suppressed mitochondria translation of mtDNA-encoded cytochrome c oxidase
subunit I (Cox I) in H1299 cell. (B) Total ATP was determined by using ATP
bioluminescent assay kit as described in the ‘‘Materials and Methods’’ section.
Mitochondria inhibitor rotenone was used as positive control. Chloramphenicol
treatment decreased ATP biosynthesis in H1299 cell. The ATP restriction
condition resembled the hypoxia. (C) To evaluate the invasion capacity of
chloramphenicol-treated H1299 cell, the Matrigel-coated 8-lm transwells were
used as described in the ‘‘Materials and Methods’’ section. The data showed
that chloramphenicol-induced ATP-restricted H1299 cell exhibited stronger
invasion activity than control. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001

were increased in both dose- and time-dependent manner
(Figs. 2A and 2B). In a qPCR assay, the MMP-13 mRNA was
also increased in chloramphenicol-treated H1299 cells (Fig. 2C).
Under the testing conditions, the collagenases (MMP-1),
gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), stromelysins (MMP-10 and
MMP-11), and MMP-14 remained either unaffected or down-
regulated (Fig. 2A). Chloramphenicol-induced MMP-13 mRNA
expression was observed in H1299, A549, and HepG2, whereas
the MMP-3 mRNA expression was observed only in H1299 and
A549. Chloramphenicol-induced MMP-13 expression was
observed in nine solid-tumor cell lines (including H1299,
HepG2, A549, CL-10, NCI-N87, Huh7, SAS, GBM8401, and
Hep1) but not in leukemia suspensions (including THP-1,
HL-60, and Jurkat) (Supplementary ﬁg. 2). Leukemia suspen-
sions usually have less mitochondria copy number than somatic
cells (Mendoza et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2008; Shmookler
Reis and Goldstein, 1983). The less mitochondria copy number
in leukemia suspensions may diminish the mitochondria-to-
nucleus stress signaling, resulting in less response of cells to
chloramphenicol.
Both MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA expression levels remained
unaffected in immortalized normal cells (including HaCaT
keratinocytes, CCD-966SK ﬁbroblast, IMR-90, retinal pigmented
epithelial cell [ARPE]) and primary cultures (human umbilical
veinendothelialcell,humankidneyepithelialcell,mouselungcell,
rat cardiocyte, and rat vascular smooth muscle cell) (Supplemen-
tary ﬁg. 2). Our ﬁndings suggest that the chloramphenicol-induced
MMP-13 expression only existed in solid-tumor cells but not in
leukemia suspensions and normal cells.
Recently, both MMP-3 and MMP-13 have been demon-
strated to enhance extracellular matrix degradation and cancer
cell invasion. However, the chloramphenicol-induced invasive
activities were inhibited by coincubation with the speciﬁc
MMP-13 inhibitor CL-82198 but not the MMP-3 inhibitor
NNGH (N-isobutyl-N-[4-methoxyphenylsulphonyl] glycyl
hydroxamic acid) (Fig. 2D).
FIG. 2. The MMP-13 mRNA was induced in chloramphenicol-treated cancer cell and then facilitated cancer cell invasive activity. The mRNA levels of
MMPs in chloramphenicol-treated cells were analyzed by RT-PCR as described in the ‘‘Materials and Methods’’ section. (A) Both MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA
expression were induced in chloramphenicol (10–100 lg/ml)-treated H1299 cell in a dose-dependent manner. (B) Chloramphenicol (20 lg/ml)-induced MMP-13
mRNA expression was observed in cancer cell lines H1299, A549, and HepG2 in a time-dependent manner. However, chloramphenicol-induced MMP-3 mRNA
expression was observed only in cancer cell lines H1299 and A549. Both MMP-3 and MMP-13 mRNA expression levels remained unaffected in immortalized
HaCaT and primary human umbilical vein endothelial cell . (C) The qPCR data showed that chloramphenicol treatment increased MMP-13 mRNA expression.
(D) Chloramphenicol-induced cancer cell invasion could be inhibited by MMP-13 inhibitor, CL-82198 (20lM), but not by MMP-3 inhibitor, NNGH (20lM).

CHLORAMPHENICOL INDUCES MMP-13 EXPRESSION 143
Wealsofoundthattheconditionedmediumofchloramphenicol-
treated H1299 cells could enhance the invasive ability of
A549 cells, which have previously been demonstrated to have
weak invasive ability (Mooradian et al., 1992). This increase
could also be inhibited by CL-82198 (Fig. 3A). During the
entire process, the Western blots and gelatin zymography also
showed strong proteolytic activity of the MMP-13 protein in
conditioned medium with chloramphenicol-treated H1299
cells (Fig. 3B). Next, we investigated the effect of
chloramphenicol-induced MMP-13 expression on cancer cell
metastasis in vivo. In comparison with H1299, treatment with
100 lg/ml chloramphenicol for 24 h led to a remarkable
increase in metastatic colony formation on lung surface. The
MMP-13 inhibitor, CL-82198, inhibited metastatic activity of
chloramphenicol-treated cells (Fig. 3C). The in vivo data
supported that chloramphenicol-induced MMP-13 expression
is strongly associated with metastatic capacity of solid-tumor
cells.
Chloramphenicol Activated Mitogen-Activated Protein
Kinases and PI-3 Kinase/Akt Signaling
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p42/
p44 ERK, JNK and p38-MAPK, and Akt, were activated in
chloramphenicol-treated H1299 cells in both a dose-dependent
(Fig. 4A) and a time-dependent manner (Supplementary ﬁg. 3).
The Effects of MAPKs and PI-3 Kinase Inhibitors on
Chloramphenicol-Induced MMP-13 Expression
To assess the involvement of MAPK and phosphatidylino-
sitol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt signaling in chloramphenicol-
induced MMP-13 mRNA expression, cells pretreated with
MAPKs and PI-3K inhibitors were cotreated with chloram-
phenicol and assayed by RT-PCR. Results showed that both SP
600125 and LY 294002 suppressed chloramphenicol-mediated
MMP-13 mRNA expression. However, the induction of MMP-
13 by chloramphenicol treatment remained unaffected by PD
98059 or SB 203580 (Fig. 4B). The SP 600125 and LY 294002
FIG. 3. The MMP-13 protein in chloramphenicol-treated H1299 condition

A549 cells were
seeded into transwells and incubated with condition medium of chloramphenicol-
treated H1299 cell for 24 h. The data showed that secreted MMP-13 in condition
medium could enhance A549 cells invasion. The increase in invasive A549 cell
counts could be prevented by MMP-13 inhibitor, CL-82198 (20lM), but not by
MMP-3 inhibitor, NNGH (20lM). *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001

was collected, and the protein was precipitated by 10% trichloroacetic acid. MMP-
13 protein in condition medium was detected by Western blotting. For gelatin
zymography, the condition medium was concentrated. The gelatin enzymatic
digestion wasperformed as described inthe ‘‘Materialsand Methods’’ section. Both
MMP-13 protein level and activity were increased in chloramphenicol-treated
H1299 condition medium in a time-dependent manner. (C) The in vivo metastatic
activity was evaluated by lung colonization assay. The H1299 or chloramphenicol-
treated H1299 cells were iv injected into living C57BL/6J mice. Twenty days later,
the colonies formation on lung surface was counted. No colony was found in mice
received DMEM injection. Treatment with 100 lg/ml chloramphenicol for 24 h led
to a remarkable increase of metastatic colonies formation on lung surface compared
to H1299 cell control. MMP-13 inhibitor, CL-82198, treatment inhibited metastatic
activity to a resting state. ***p < 0.001 indicate a statistical difference with the

also inhibited MMP-13 activity by gelatin zymography
(Fig. 4C) and chloramphenicol-induced cell invasion
(Fig. 4D). Chloramphenicol-induced JNK phosphorylation
could also be inhibited by LY 294002, whereas SP 600125
did not abolish Akt activation (Fig. 5A). The data suggest that
PI-3K/Akt/JNK signaling is essential for chloramphenicol-
associated MMP-13 induction and cancer cell invasion.
PI-3 Kinase/Akt/JNK Signaling Required for
Chloramphenicol-Induced c-Jun Phosphorylation and
MMP-13 Expression
Coincubation with SP 600125 or LY 294002 inhibited
chloramphenicol-induced c-Jun phosphorylation in the nu-
cleus. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein
was used as an internal control in the nuclear extracts (Fig. 5A).
Plasmids encoding DN JNK or the p85 subunit of PI-3K
(DN p85) were transfected into H1299 cells. The HA-tag
protein conﬁrmed the successful expression of the DN JNK
and p85 proteins. In these successfully transfected cells,
chloramphenicol-induced JNK activation and c-Jun phosphor-
ylation were reduced, and there was no MMP-13 activity in
gelatin digestion (Fig. 5B).
Chloramphenicol Increased Activator Protein 1 DNA–
Binding Activity and Induced MMP-13 Expression
The transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) com-
ponent protein, phospho-cJun, increased in nuclear extracts
from chloramphenicol-induced H1299 cells in both a dose-
dependent (Fig. 6A) a and time-dependent manner (Supplemen-
tary ﬁg. 6). MMP-13 expression could be repressed by the AP-1
inhibitor curcumin (Fig. 6B), but not by the nuclear factor-jB
inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate or Bay–17–7085 (Supple-
mentary ﬁg. 4). The direct DNA binding between phospho-cJun
protein and AP-1 consensus sequence (TGACTCA) were
demonstrated by EMSA studies in vitro (data not shown).
ChIP was used for assaying the phospho-cJun protein–
binding activity to the MMP-13 promoter. Validation of the
method is shown in Supplementary ﬁgure 5. The phospho-cJun
protein was coimmunoprecipitated together with the MMP-13
promoter in both a dose-dependent (Fig. 6C) and a time-
dependent manner (Supplementary ﬁg. 6). Coincubation with
SP 600125 or LY 294002 inhibited the interaction between
phospho-cJun and MMP-13 promoter (Fig. 6D). This ﬁnding
suggests that the transcription factor AP-1 is required for
chloramphenicol-induced MMP-13 expression and further
MMP-13–mediated cell invasion.

In addition to chloramphenicol, other antibiotics, including
minocycline, doxycycline, and clindamycin, may also inhibit
FIG. 4. Effects of MAPKs and PI-3 kinase inhibitors on chloramphenicol-induced MMP-13 mRNA expression. (A) H1299 cells were treated with
0–100 lg/ml chloramphenicol for 24 h, and the phosphorylation of MAPKs and Akt were detected by Western blotting. The blots showed that ERK, JNK,
p38-MAPK, and Akt were activated in respond to chloramphenicol treatments. Chloramphenicol-induced activation of MAPKs and Akt can be inhibited by
speciﬁc inhibitors, PD 98059 (ERK inhibitor), SP 600125 (JNK inhibitor), SB 203580 (p38-MAPK inhibitor), and LY 294002 (PI-3K inhibitor). The fold
changes of protein phosphorylation were analyzed by densitometry. (B) Chloramphenicol-mediated MMP-13 expression was inhibited by SP 600125 and
LY 294002 but not by PD 98059 and SB 203580. The fold changes of MMP-13 mRNA were analyzed by densitometry. (C) The gelatin zymography showed
SP 600125 and LY 294002 could inhibit chloramphenicol-mediated increase in pro-MMP-13 activities. (D) Chloramphenicol-induced increase in invasion

signaling in chloramphenicol-induced JNK activation. (B) Plasmids encoded DN

mitochondrial translation (Fig. 7A), cause ATP restriction
(Fig. 7B), induce MMP-13 mRNA expression (Fig. 7C), and
facilitate cell invasion (Fig. 7D). It has been reported
previously that doxycycline inhibits MMPs. For MMP-13,
doxycycline did not function as an inhibitor below 200lM
(48 lg/ml). The inhibition concentration may be difﬁcult to
achieve in vivo (Smith et al., 1998). However, the 10 lg/ml
doxycycline induced MMP-13 expression in H1299 cell.
DISCUSSION
Tumor cells usually change their mitochondrial function,
triggers a mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling, and changes gene
expression that make the tumor cells more likely to invade
(Fosslien, 2008; Uchiyama et al., 2004). The MMPs are well-
known metastatic factors (Kuzuya and Iguchi, 2003). Tumor
metastatic potential correlated with enzymatic degradation of
type IV collagen. MMP-13 shows the highest proteolytic
activity among the collagenases and could degrade type IV
collagen at both a2(IV) and a1(IV) chains. Thus, MMP-13–
expressing cells often have strong invasive capacities (Kna¨uper
et al., 1997a). Clinical evidence support the fact that MMP-13
appearances is highly relevant to the invasive of squamous cell
carcinomas, non–small cell lung cancer, malignant peripheral
nerve sheath tumors, and breast tumors (Holtkamp et al., 2007;
Hsu et al., 2006; Nil et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2008). Our
previous studies showed that chloramphenicol treatment
caused mitochondrial stress and senescence-associated apopto-
sis resistance in cancer cells (Li et al., 2005). In this study, we
further proved that chloramphenicol treatment caused ATP
restriction and enhanced cancer cell invasion both in vitro and
in vivo. The involvement of MMP-13 was supported by the fact
that both MMP-13 protein and mRNA were induced by
chloramphenicol treatment. This enhanced invasion was
blocked by MMP-13 inhibitors. The activation of proMMP-
13 can be regulated by membrane-type MMPs (MMP-14) and
stromelysin (MMP-10) (Itoh and Seiki, 2006; Nakamura et al.,
1998). In this study, the expression of MMP-14 did not change
signiﬁcantly. However, MMP-10 and MMP-11 were down-
regulated, suggesting that the invasive effects mentioned above
resulted directly from MMP-13 induction. Furthermore, the
activated MMP-13 can activate gelatinases and enhance
invasion indirectly (Kna¨uper et al., 1997b).
FIG. 6. Chloramphenicol treatment increased AP-1 DNA–binding activity to MMP-13 promoter. (A) The blot showed that the phospho-cJun was accumulated
in nuclear extract of chloramphenicol-treated H1299 cell. The PCNA was used as internal control of nuclear extract. (B) Chloramphenicol-induced MMP-13
expression was inhibited by the transcription factor AP-1 inhibitor, curcumin (10–50lM). The fold changes of MMP-13 mRNA were analyzed by densitometry.
(C) The ChIP was used for assay the interaction between phospho-cJun and MMP-13 promoter. In chloramphenicol-treated cell, the ChIP-captured MMP-13
promoter was increased in dose-dependent manner. (D) Coincubation with SP 600125 and LY 294002 decreased the DNA-binding activity of phospho-cJun
protein to MMP-13 promoter. These data suggested that JNK, PI-3K/Akt, and AP-1 activities were required for chloramphenicol-induced MMP-13 mRNA
induction. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001 indicate a statistical difference with the control. #

CHLORAMPHENICOL INDUCES MMP-13 EXPRESSION 147
MMP-13 can be induced by parathyroid hormone, platelet-
derived growth factor, basic ﬁbroblast growth factor, TGF-b,
and interleukins (Rydziel et al., 2000; Selvamurugan et al.,
1998; Solı´s-Herruzo et al., 1999; Varghese et al., 2000). The
JNK/AP-1, p38-MAPK/NF-jB, p38-MAPK/Smad, PI-3K/Akt,
and NO/cGMP/ERK have been associated with MMP-13
expression as previously reported (Ahmed et al., 2003;
Barchowsky et al., 2000; Lechuga et al., 2004; Leivonen
et al., 2002; Zaragoza et al., 2002). Our data showed that PI-
3K/Akt/JNK was activated in chloramphenicol-treated cells.
Inhibition of JNK and PI-3K/Akt (by chemical inhibitor or by
DN kinases) could negate chloramphenicol-induced c-Jun
phosphorylation, MMP-13 expression, and cell invasion. The
c-Jun phosphorylation proved that transcription factor AP-1 is
essential. The AP-1–responsive genes, including proteases
(MMPs and cathepsins) and actin cytoskeleton regulators, are
strongly associated with cell invasion (Ozanne et al., 2000).
An AP-1 consensus sequence was found in the proximal
region of MMP-13 promoter (Tardif et al., 1997), and the
binding of phospho-cJun protein with MMP-13 promoter was
demonstrated by ChIP assay. These ﬁndings suggest that
chloramphenicol-induced MMP-13 upregulation is dependent
on PI-3K/JNK/AP-1 activity (Supplementary ﬁg. 7).
Mitochondrial stress, by mitochondrial DNA depletion,
hypoxia, or aging, resulted in altered energy metabolism and
intracellular calcium homeostasis. Mitochondrial stress also
induced mitochondria-to-nucleus stress signaling, such as
MAPKs and PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling (Uchiyama et al.,
2004). The speciﬁc stress signaling conﬁrmed apoptosis
resistance and enhanced cancer cell invasion (Fosslien,
2008). Recently, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin has been
demonstrated to interfere with mitochondrial transcription,
inhibit apoptosis, and lead to invasive phenotype formation
(Biswas et al., 2008). In mitochondria-damaged cells, with the
increase of cytosolic calcium, calcineurin-sensitive NF-jB/Rel
factor is activated. This signaling strengthens the expression of
cathepsin L and cathepsin B and leads to an increase in
invasive ability (Amuthan et al., 2001; Biswas et al., 2008;
Hamer et al., 2009).
In our study, we found that chloramphenicol-induced
PI-3K/JNK/AP-1 activation might function as a novel
mitochondria-to-nucleus stress signal. The signal increased
MMP-13 expression and MMP-13–associated cancer cell
invasion. Moreover, antibiotics with the ability to inhibit
mitochondrial translation would also cause senescence-
associated apoptosis resistance (Li et al., 2005) and MMP-
13 expression. These antibiotics have been used for many
years in the treatment of skin and other infections. Hence, the
clinical signiﬁcance of our study is that chloramphenicol
application, as well as other 70S ribosomal inhibitors, should
be used with caution, especially during cancer therapy. As
a result, the chloramphenicol-treated solid-tumor cell also
provides a model for further investigation of mitochondrial
damage and cancer progression.
