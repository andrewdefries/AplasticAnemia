THE RELATIONSHIP OF SERUM LYSOZYME TO LEUKOCYTES AND
OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL FACTORS
The primary objective of this study was to explore the relationship between
leukocyte turnover and serum lysozyme. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes and
monocytes contain relatively high concentrations of this enzyme,1"2 and it
seems possible that the major portion of the lysozyme found in plasma is
derived from the eventual breakdown of these cells. Thus, variations in rates
of leukocyte production and destruction would alter serum lysozyme concen-
tration. In order to evaluate these relationships, however, it was necessary
to determine the influence of age, sex and certain other constitutional factors
on serum lysozyme. Of special interest in this study was whether or not
serum lysozyme levels might reflect alterations in leukocyte or other body
tissue turnover in subjects previously exposed to excessive amounts of ioniz-
ing radiation.
Previous investigations with the enzyme, lysozyme, suggest its suitability
for studies of this type. Lymphocytes and erythrocytes contain little or
none1'2 while certain other body cells contain moderate to relatively large
concentrations."1 Following in vitro physical disruption of leukocytes some
of the enzyme is released,"' but much of it probably remains firmly within
granules and other cellular components. Additional experimental evidence
has shown that in vivo lysis of granulocytes will elevate serum lysozyme.12

METHOD OF STUDY
During the months of April, May, and June of 1961 serum lysozyme determinations
were performed for 670 regularly-scheduled Japanese subjects participating in the
Adult Health Study in Hiroshima, Japan. This continuing clinical investigation of
possible late effects attributable to ionizing radiation from the atomic bomb is a joint
undertaking of the Japanese National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Atomic
Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC).

The sample for the ABCC-NIH Adult Health Study is composed of four age-sex
balanced components:
Group 1: within 2,000 meters of the hypocenter; reported acute radiation symptoms.
Group 2: within 2,000 meters of the hypocenter; reported no acute radiation symp-
toms.
Group 3: 3,000 to 3,499 meters from the hypocenter.
Group 4: beyond 10,000 meters from the hypocenter or not in the city at the time
of the bomb.
The Hiroshima sample totals slightly more than 13,000 persons, and the Nagasaki
sample consists of slightly more than 6,000 persons who receive detailed clinical
examinations at approximately two-year intervals (Table 1). The entire sample is
divided equally into twenty-four examination groups, designated A through X. Each
month, one of these alphabetically-designated groups is scheduled for routine clinical
examination at ABCC.

RESULTS
Serum lysozyme values were not strongly related to the total leukocyte
count or to the absolute granulocyte count, although the latter relationship
was more impressive than the former. The two correlation coefficients were

the 5 per cent significance level. When the data were arranged in categorical
fashion, however, the relationships were seen more clearly (Table 2). Chi
square tests returned significant values, barely so for the total leukocyte
count but highly significant for the absolute granulocyte count. Comparisons
between the 50 highest and lowest absolute monocyte counts and corre-
sponding serum lysozyme values showed no significant relationship.

Serum lysozyme values varied significantly with sex, age, and month of
examination (Tables 3, 4, and 5). Significantly higher values were obtained
for males in comparison to females.
Serum lysozyme varied directly with age in a consistent, steady, step-
wise fashion for each of the age decades measured. Differences through the
middle years of life, however, were small. As measured by the correlation

age, and even more influential than sex.
The data relating serum lysozyme values to distance from the hypocenter
at the time of the bombing are shown in Table 6. There is no suggestion
from this material that level of serum lysozyme is related to distance from
the hypocenter or symptoms of acute radiation injury following the bombing.
Relationships between serum lysozyme and medical diagnoses are more
difficult to evaluate. The subjects under study come to the ABCC clinic not
because they are ill, but for a routine physical examination at a prearranged
time. A few arrive with acute illnesses of moderate severity and some have

chronic illnesses, but the majority are completely well or have only trivial
medical problems. In fact, of the 670 subjects studied here, 237, or 35 per
cent, had no disorder diagnosed; while the remaining 433 subjects had 744
diagnoses assigned to them. For analysis in relation to serum lysozyme
values, certain diagnoses were grouped following the International Classi-
fication of Diseases.'5 The distributions of lysozyme values by diagnoses
are shown in Table 7. For patients with multiple diagnoses, each diagnosis

with its corresponding serum lysozyme value is considered separately.
Only a few diagnostic groups demonstrated relationships to serum lyso-
zyme values. The only statistically significant different distribution of
values in comparison to the over-all occurred with diabetes mellitus (chi
square of 12.75, and p < .01). For tuberculosis and diseases of the
respiratory system the differences were suggestive, but not significant (p
between .05 and .10).
In an attempt to explain the increased serum lysozyme values found in
patients with diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis, the data were examined
from the standpoint of peculiarities in distribution of persons with these
diagnoses. It was found that, for each of the two diagnoses the increases in
average lysozyme values were not entirtely explicable on the basis of unusual

distributions by sex, age, or month of examination. After correction for all
three factors simultaneously, persons with these diagnoses still had elevated
serum lysozyme values, but the elevation was reduced to about one half of
the uncorrected difference, and was no longer statistically significant.
The clinical records of the 26 patients with diabetes mellitus were
examined for evidence of infection. It was found that of the 14 with clearly
elevated lysozyme values, 11 had suggestive or definite evidence of some
type of inflammatory process. Three had active pulmonary tuberculosis and
for these patients the serum lysozyme values were 2.37 unit, 3.43 unit, and
4.14 unit. Of the 12 remaining diabetic patients with normal or low lyso-
zyme values, none had overt evidence of infection, but two had moderately
increased sedimentation rates.
With respect to respiratory illness, more detailed study showed that 9 of
the 45 had acute respiratory disease and 36 had chronic disturbances. Of the
9 with acute respiratory infections, 7 had serum lysozyme values in excess
of 2.20 units, and of the 36 with chronic respiratory disorders only 9 had
serum lysozyme values in excess of 2.20 units.
The data showing variation in serum lysozyme values by month of
examination were examined in several ways. Although the relative number
of patients with diabetes mellitus, active pulmonary tuberculosis and acute
respiratory disease was greater in the studies completed in April compared
to those for June, the numbers were small and did not appear influential.
Furthermore, the mean lysozyme values for patients with these associated
disorders declined progressively with month of examination, suggesting
that the processes were quite independent of one another. Other tests
showed that the time trend was not the result of variations in distribution of
subjects examined in relationship to sex, age, or absolute level of granulo-
cytes.
DISCUSSION
Total leukocyte count and serum lysozyme were, at best, weakly related.
A much stronger relationship was established between absolute granulocyte
level and serum lysozyme. This later relationship was studied for other
possible influences and it was determined that it could not be explained on
the basis of age, sex, month of examination, or type of medical illness. If the
total granulocyte counts in the individuals studied was a reasonable reflec-
tion of the size of the total leukocyte mass it then becomes possible to relate
serum lysozyme levels to granulocyte turnover.
In this study it was not possible to adequately examine the relationship
between circulating monocytes and serum lysozyme. Those subjects with the
a"'
Volume 36, APril, 1964
Serum lysozyme and leukocytes I FINCH, LAMPHERE, JABLON
highest and lowest absolute monocyte counts, however, did not show signifi-
cant variation. It seems likely that the variation in total monocytes in
healthy subjects is too small to significantly influence serum enzyme levels.
The results of this investigation give indirect support to the belief that
lymphocytes contain little lysozyme. No enzyme activity was detected by
two of the authors (S.C.F. and J.P.L.) following in vitro lysis of platelets
removed from two patients with thrombocytosis.
The kinetics of leukopoiesis are poorly understood, but there now is much
evidence that with certain abnormalities, the number of leukocytes in circu-
lation is not necessarily an accurate reflection of either total leukocyte mass
or rate of leukocyte production and destruction. A low peripheral white
count may be the result of decreased leukocyte survival, a shift of leukocytes
from circulating to noncirculating sites, diminished leukopoiesis, or com-
binations of any of these. An elevated leukocyte count may be the result of
prolongation of leukocyte survival, a shift in leukocytes from noncirculating
sites to active circulation, increased leukopoiesis, or various combinations
of these.
If a valid relationship exists between in vivo granulocyte destruction and
serum lysozyme, then those subjects with elevated granulocyte counts and
increased serum lysozyme levels have increased granulocyte turnover.
Similarly, those patients with low absolute granulocyte counts and reduced
serum lysozyme levels have decreased granulocyte turnover. This study
does not prove these relationships but the data are consistent with the
hypothesis. It is quite likely that the patients with high leukocyte counts
and high lysozyme levels not only have increased granulocyte turnover but
also increased fixed tissue breakdown associated with infection to con-
tribute to the elevated lysozyme content of the serum. More convincing is
the fact that low absolute granulocyte counts were associated with low
lysozyme levels. If these low granulocyte counts were the result of dimin-
ished leukopoiesis and a reduced rate of granulocyte destruction, then there
is good support to the thesis that the serum receives its major contribution
of lysozyme from destroyed granulocytes.
A reasonable test of this hypothesis would be to determine serum lyso-
zyme levels in patients with disorders associated with diminished leuko-
poiesis such as aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis. Patients with leukemoid
reactions, granulocytic leukemia and monocytic leukemia might give
information at the other end of the spectrum.
The direct relationship between age and serum lysozyme cannot be
explained at the present time, but the data suggest that increased lysozyme
levels may be part of the normal aging process. The data for serum lysozyme
3S7
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
levels by age were examined for other possible influences. It was deter-
mined that sex, diagnosis, and month of examination were not responsible
for the relationships. The absolute granulocyte count varied inversely with
age, but the relationship was weak. It was, however, stronger in females
than in males. Although the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis
increased with advancing age, this did not account for the relationship
betwen age and serum lysozyme.
The most intriguing possibilities to explain the high serum lysozyme
levels in the aged are that intracellular enzyme accumulations are increased
or that there is increased catabolism of tissues containing lysozyme.
Increased accumulation of hydrolytic enzymes, appearing in association
with "age pigment," has been described in the cytoplasm of "aged" cells.'
It was postulated in these studies that the increased quantity of intra-
cellular hydrolytic enzyme in the aging cell results in eventual death of the
cell by a process of autodigestion. Cathepsin was one of the enzymes
described, but it seems not improbable that lysozyme also could be similarly
involved. Other mechanisms to be explored are diminished renal function
with advancing age and increase in the rate of granulocyte destruction. Irre-
spective of cause, however, the relationship between serum lysozyme level
and age may provide an additional tool for study of the aging process.
No correlation between serum lysozyme level and distance from hypo-
center or radiation symptoms was found. It has been speculated that a late
effect of heavy exposure to ionizing radiation might be diminished granulo-
poiesis. This should be associated with decreased granulocyte destruction
and low serum lysozyme. Neither reduced granulocyte counts nor low serum
lysozyme characterized the heavily exposed A-bomb survivors. Prevoius
investigations within the Adult Health Study population also have failed
to show a significant relationship between previous irradiation and absolute
granulocyte levels.17 If lysozyme is related to the aging process, the question
arises as to whether there are differences in the age-lysozyme relationship
among survivors compared to those not in the city at the time of the bomb.
No differences were observed in this small series, but perhaps these
relationships should be tested on a much larger scale.
The increased serum lysozyme levels in diabetic subjects is difficult to
explain. The diabetes in this group of patients was mild with persistent
moderate hyperglycemia and glycosuria without acidosis. Most of the
patients did not take insulin, but our observations have shown no
evidence of a relationship between hyperglycemia and elevation of the serum
lysozyme. Degenerative processes may have been accelerated, but it is more
likely that changes of this type would have been insignificant. Bacterial
358

infection probably was the single most important factor, even though
peripheral leukocyte counts were not elevated. At least in part, the higher
serum lysozyme values were attributed to the greater than average age for
this group in comparison to the controls.
Local tissue inflammation with increased fixed tissue and granulocyte
destruction probably was responsible for the small, nonsignificant elevations
in serum lysozyme levels in the groups with respiratory diseases and tuber-
culosis. Increased lysozyme levels have been noted previously in the plasma
of patients with tuberculosis.'8 At the present time we are studying a large
group of patients who are in different stages of active pulmonary tuber-
culosis. The modest relationship between increased serum lysozyme and
tuberculosis in the present study may have been due to the fact that most
of the diagnoses were in patients with minimal or inactive disease. In
general, this group of patients tended to have slightly higher granulocyte
counts.
No explanation is offered for the moderate sex variation in serum lyso-
zyme values. It was shown not to be due to peculiarities in respect to age,
disease, month of examination, or absolute granulocyte count.
The most difficult relationship to explain is that between serum lysozyme
values and month of examination. Tests for unusual distribution of patients
during each month in respect to age, sex, type of disease, and absolute
granulocyte count were not rewarding. The laboratory techniques did not
change during this period, and consistent results have been repeatedly
obtained. Although these relationships should be explored further, the
monthly change in mean values did not interfere with other portions of
the study. A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that in the early
months clinically unrecognizable respiratory disease was responsible.
SUMMARY
1. Serum lysozyme levels were determined in 670 consecutive outpatients
seen for regularly scheduled clinic examinations as part of the Adult
Health Study in Hiroshima, Japan.
2. Serum lysozyme levels were found to vary significantly with the absolute
peripheral granulocyte count, age, sex, and month of study.
3. A high level of correlation was noted between serum lysozyme and
diabetes mellitus. This may have been due to a combination of greater
than average age in patients with diabetes and underlying inflammatory
disease.
4. A suggestive relationship was established between serum lysozyme
levels, respiratory diseases and tuberculosis. These changes are believed
359
YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE Volume 36, April, 1964
to reflect active inflammation with excessive destruction of granulocytes
and parenchymal tissues in those patients with the more acute processes.
5. No relationship was found between serum lysozyme and previous
exposure to ionizing radiation.
6. These studies indicate that the serum lysozyme level may be useful in
the study of the kinetics of leukopoiesis, the aging process, and in the
detection of subtle inflammatory processes.
