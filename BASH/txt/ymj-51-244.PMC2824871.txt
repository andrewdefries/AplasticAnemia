Urolithiasis is one of the most common urologic diseases, and its incidence and
prevalence is generally reported between 0.1-0.3% and 5-10% in the general
population.1
Although there is still debate regarding the causes of stone, the risk
factors that are known to contribute to stone occurrence are Caucasian race, the
male gender, a family history of urolithiasis, immobilization, urinary infection,
glucocorticoid therapy, hypercalcemia, hyperuricuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitria, etc.
The role of glucocorticoid is particularly striking in patients treated with con-
solidation chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Howard, et al.2
reported that the rate
of urolithiasis was 4.5 times higher for patients during induction therapy and 2.2
times higher for patients during consolidation therapy using pulsatile gluco-
corticoids than that for patients who had completed therapy.
Despite anticipating a high incidence of stone due to the characteristic therapy
for patients suffering from malignant hematologic diseases, there have been few
studies on this in the English medical literature. Therefore, we performed this study
to find incidences and characteristics of urolithiasis in patients with malignant
hematologic diseases.

Purpose: We performed this study in order to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of urolithiasis in patients
with malignant hematologic diseases. Materials and Methods: Nine hundred one patients who underwent medical
treatment for malignant hematologic disease and 40,543 patients who visited the emergency room and without
malignant hematologic diseases were included in our study. The patients with malignant hematologic diseases were
divided into two groups depending on their primary treatment. Group I included patients with acute and chronic
leukemia (AML, ALL, CML, CLL) for which chemotherapy and steroid therapy was necessary, and group II
included patients with anaplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome and who had undergone repeated
transfusion for treatment. Comparisons were made between the two groups in respect to the incidence of
urolithiasis and the stones’ radiopacity. Results: Twenty nine patients (3.2%) of the 901 malignant hematologic
patients were diagnosed with urolithiasis, compared to 575 patients (1.4%) of 40,543 emergency room patients.
There was a significant increase of the incidence of urolithiasis in the malignant hematologic group. Compared to
the general patients, the patients with malignant hematologic diseases had a higher rate of radiolucent stones (46.6%
versus 16.3%, respectively), and the difference was significant. Conclusion: The incidence of urolithiasis for
malignant hematologic patients was significantly higher than that for the control group.

INTRODUCTION
Nine hundred one patients from the Hematologic Depart-
ment who received medical treatment for malignant hema-
tologic diseases between July 2003 and June 2005 were
included in our study, and 40,543 patients who visited the
emergency room during that same period without malig-
nant hematologic diseases were included in the control
group.
Of the 901 evaluable patients with malignant hemato-
logic diseases, the median age at the time of diagnosis was
46 years (age range: 20 to 67 years) and that of the 40,543
patients was 46 years (age range: 20 to 94 years). The ratio
of male to female was 0.93 : 1 and 0.96 : 1 in the patients
group and control group, respectively.
The patients with malignant hematologic diseases-were
only enrolled after July 2003 and we excluded the patients
with a history of urolithiasis before making the diagnosis
of malignant hematologic diseases.
The patients with malignant hematologic diseases were
divided into two groups depending on their main treatment:
group I (n = 520) included acute and chronic leukemia
which needed chemotherapy and glucocorticoid therapy,
and group II (n = 379) included patients with anaplastic
anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome and who had
undergone repeated blood transfusions for treatment. We
investigated the presence of chemotherapy and glucocor-
ticoid therapy, the number of blood transfusions, and the
incidence rate of urolithiasis for each group. The diagnosis
of urolithiasis was confirmed by excretory urography or
abdominal computerized tomography (CT) for the patients
who visited our department due to symptoms of uroli-
thiasis-like flank pain and/or hematuria. Comparisons were
made between the two groups with respect to the incidence
of urolithiasis and the stones’ nature by radiopacity through
Plain film of the kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB).
The patients were retrospectively identified by a com-
puter-assisted review of the medical charts and by using an
image recording system. Fisher’s exact test was used to
analyze the data for statistics. p values < 0.05 were regarded
as significant.
Twenty nine (3.2%) of the 901 patients with malignant
hematologic diseases were diagnosed with urolithiasis,
compared to 575 (1.4%) of the 40,543 general patients
who visited the emergency room. The incidence of uroli-
thiasis of the malignant hematologic group significantly
increased (p = 0.043) (Fig. 1). The incidence of urolithiasis
in group I and group II was 2.9% (15/520) and 3.7%
(14/381), respectively. Although the latter was higher than
the former, there was no significant difference (p = 0.181)
The median age of the 29 patients who were confirmed
with urolithiasis and malignant hematologic diseases was
45.3 years (range: 21 years-66 years), and the gender ratio
(male : female) was 1.14 to 1 (Table 1). The size of the
stones was 4.3 ± 0.8 mm. The most common site was the
upper ureter (41.4%, 12/29) and the main symptoms were
flank pain and gross hematuria 43.3% and 36.6%, respec-
tively (Table 2). The initial therapy for urolithiasis in the
group of general patients was electric shock wave lithotripsy
(ESWL) or ureteroscopic lithotripsy [64.0% (345/575)],
while that in the group of malignant hematologic diseases
was conservative therapy [55.2% (16/29)], ESWL [37.9%
(11/29)] and ureteroscopic lithotripsy [6.8% (2/29)].
Compared to the general patients, the patients with malig-
nant hematologic diseases had a higher rate of radiolucent
stones [44.8% (13/29) versus 14.9% (86/575)], and the

difference was significant (p = 0.022) (Fig. 2).
Howard, et al.2
reported in their study, which spanned 30
years and included over 20,000 person-years of follow-up
that urolithiasis occurred in 0.9% of the pediatric acute
lymphatic leukemia patients, and the incidence was much
higher than otherwise healthy children and adolescents. In
our study, the prevalence rate of urolithiasis for the patients
with malignant hemotologic diseases was 3.2% compared
to 1.4% for the general patients, and the rate was statisti-
cally higher than that for the general patients. This incidence
rate of stone was much higher than that Hesse A, et al.4
and
Curhan, et al.4
reported (0.3-0.5%) for the general popula-
tion in Western countries, and it was also higher than that
reported by Kim, et al.5
(0.2%) for Koreans.
We think that these differences are associated with the
therapeutic methods that were used for the patients in differ-
ent studies. The basis of treatment for malignant hematolo-
gic diseases are chemotherapy and maintenance therapy by
glucocorticoid. Sixteen of the patients who had urolithiasis
had undergone chemotherapy more than once and nine of
them were given additional treatments for maintenance
therapy by glucocorticoid. It is presumed that chemotherapy
is a risk factor for urolithiasis due to tumorlysis syndrome
that often occurs during chemotherapy of patients with
malignant hematologic diseases, and tumorlysis syndrome
after chemotherapy often causes an increased concentra-
tion of uric acid in the serum by the increasing cell damage
and hemolysis.6
Glucocortcoid is widely used as maintenance therapy for
the treatment of patients with leukemia because it dec-
reases the leukemic blast cell count and the rate of extra-
medullary infiltration.7
However, glucocorticoid therapy
over a long period affects the metabolic pathway of calcium,
and then it induces decreased absorption of calcium in the
gastrointestinal tract and increased excretion of calcium in
the urine. All of these problems can lead to urinary stone
disease. Almost all the patients in the aplastic anemia and
myeloplastic syndrome groups, which had a relatively
higher incidence rate of urolithiasis, underwent repeated
blood transfusions for symptom relief. This incidence rate
was 64% of those patients who underwent blood trans-
fusion 20 times before the diagnosis of urolithiasis.
Most of patients with malignant hematologic diseases
have compromised immunity. They are susceptible to
urinary tract infection and renal dysfunction owing to
urinary obstruction. Therefore, the occurrence of urolithia-
sis in these patients is more morbid and complicated com-
pared to general patients. Yet the urolithiais of these patients
can be misdiagnosed as other diseases like gastritis,
cholecystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis. Pui, et al.10
reported in
their study that they enrolled 2,457 patients with acute
leukemia to investigate urinary stone and non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, and they confirmed urinary stones in only five
of their patients (0.2%, 5/2457). They explained that it is
possible that the urologic symptoms of urolithiasis, like
flank pain and abdominal discomfort, were mistaken for
neuropathy that was caused by chemotherapy or for
gastritis that was caused by glucocorticoid therapy. Jaing,

asserted that when patients with acute leukemia
were diagnosed as staghorn calculi, it was important to
distinguish urolithiasis from hemorrhagic cystitis due to
the side effects of chemotherapy, and attention should be
paid to the similarity of the symptoms.
In our study, we have some limitations for diagnosis
because we surveyed patients who consulted our clinic for
symptoms that were suspicious of urolithiasis. Therefore, it
is possible that symptoms of urolithiasis were in fact
neglected or mistaken for those seeming side effects of
chemotherapy given in other departments. We did not per-
form an analysis of urolithiasis in our study, therefore we
cannot confirm the accurate composition of the stones.
However, the most basic test to diagnose urinary stones is
a simple X-ray of the KUB, and the level of radiopacity on
KUB enables us to infer the composition of urinary stones
indirectly.12
The total ratio of radiolucent stones in patients
with hematologic diseases was much higher than that for
general patients. Yet the control group was limited to
patients with confirmed urolithiasis and who visited the
emergency room. So this cannot completely represent the
general population.
ESWL is inadequate to completely remove stones in the
group of patients with malignant hematologic diseases
because of the existence of radiolucent stones or hema-
tologic abnormalities, and many cases were unsuitable for
invasive ureteroscopic lithotripsy due to the chemotherapy
patients were receiving or their generally poor condition.
Further studies on the risk factors associated with the
incidence of urolithiasis, the electrolyte levels of serum or
urine, and an analysis of the composition of urinary stones
need to be done in the near future.
In conclusion, the incidence rate of urolithiasis and radio-
lucent stone in the group of patients with malignant hematol-
ogic diseases was higher than that in the group of general
patients. We cannot definitely find out the pathophysi-
ology of the stone in this study. However, close attention
should be paid to the possibility of misdiagnosing urolithi-
asis because of the treatment side effects for malignant
hematologic diseases.
