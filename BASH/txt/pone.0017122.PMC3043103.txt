Abstract
Introduction: Telomere shortening is a cell-intrinsic mechanism that limits cell proliferation by induction of DNA damage
responses resulting either in apoptosis or cellular senescence. Shortening of telomeres has been shown to occur during
human aging and in chronic diseases that accelerate cell turnover, such as chronic hepatitis. Telomere shortening can limit
organ homeostasis and regeneration in response to injury. Whether the same holds true for pancreas regeneration in
response to injury is not known.
Methods: In the present study, pancreatic regeneration after acute cerulein-induced pancreatitis was studied in late
generation telomerase knockout mice with short telomeres compared to telomerase wild-type mice with long telomeres.
Results: Late generation telomerase knockout mice exhibited impaired exocrine pancreatic regeneration after acute
pancreatitis as seen by persistence of metaplastic acinar cells and markedly reduced proliferation. The expression levels of
p53 and p21 were not significantly increased in regenerating pancreas of late generation telomerase knockout mice
compared to wild-type mice.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that pancreatic regeneration is limited in the context of telomere dysfunction without
evidence for p53 checkpoint activation.

Introduction
Telomeres represent tandem repeat sequences at the end of the
chromosomes that protect chromosomes against DNA degrada-
tion, fusions, and induction of chromosomal instability. Telomeres
shorten with each round of cell division due to the ‘end-
replication-problem’ of the DNA polymerase [1]. Upon reaching
a critical length, telomere dysfunction induces an activation of the
p53-checkpoint, which, in turn, results in either apoptosis or p21-
dependent cellular senescence [2–5]. The enzyme telomerase is
able to prevent telomere shortening by de-novo synthesis of the
telomere sequence. In humans, telomerase is active in germ cells,
during embryogenesis, and, to some extent, in adult stem cells.
Impaired organ maintenance and regeneration are hallmarks of
aging. On the molecular level, telomere shortening occurs in most
human tissues during aging [6]. To what extent it causally
contributes to aging in humans is still under debate. In addition,
telomere shortening has been linked to various chronic diseases,
such as anemia, chronic infections, Alzheimer’s disease, and
chronic liver disease [6]. Mutations in telomerase are the cause of
dyskeratosis congenita and have also been found in pulmonary
fibrosis and aplastic anemia patients [7,8]. Telomere shortening
has also been linked to the progression of chronic liver disease,
especially with the formation of cirrhosis in response to chronic
hepatitis [9]. Taken together, these findings indicate that telomere
shortening is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases and
may limit organ regeneration.
In order to analyze the consequences of telomere dysfunction in
vivo, we made use of the telomerase knockout (mTerc2/2
) mouse
[10,11]. mTerc2/2
mice are lacking the RNA component of
telomerase, which leads to an abrogation of the ability to elongate
telomeres during cell division. These mice are characterized by
continuous telomere shortening with successive generations. As a
consequence, late generation mTerc2/2
mice show a progeroid
phenotype with impaired maintenance of highly proliferative
organs, such as the intestinal epithelium and the hematopoetic
system [11]. In addition, studies on mTerc2/2
mice have revealed
that telomere shortening limits liver regeneration upon acute or
chronic injury [12,13].
It is currently unknown whether telomere shortening would
impair the regenerative capacity of the pancreas. Pancreas
regeneration itself is crucial in response to acute or chronic
pancreatitis since both processes damage tissue integrity. It has
been shown that acute pancreatitis has a more unfavourable

outcome in aged compared to young patients [14]. In addition,
it is known that successive telomere shortening occurs in the
human pancreas during aging [15]. However, the effect of
age and the potential contributions of telomere shortening to
pancreatic regeneration after acute pancreatitis have not yet been
investigated.
In the present study, we used a late generation telomerase
knockout mouse model (G3 mTerc2/2
) in order to study
consequences of telomere shortening on pancreas regeneration
after cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. In this model, repetitive
cerulein injections lead to an acute inflammation with significant
damage predominantly to the exocrine pancreas followed by
successive complete regeneration [16]. This study provides the first
experimental evidence that telomere shortening impairs regener-
ation of the exocrine pancreas.
Results
Normal pancreas development of telomerase knockout
mice despite telomere shortening
Aged telomerase knockout mice are characterized by an
impairment in the maintenance of highly proliferative organs
leading to intestine and bone marrow failure [11]. An analysis of
histological sections revealed no morphologic abnormalities of
pancreata of 8–10 month old G3 mTerc2/2
mice compared to
mTerc+/+
mice (n = 75 mice per group, Figure 1A). In addition,
we could not observe any change in pancreatic wet weight
(7.61560.5554 mg/g for mTerc+/+, 7.54460.7685 mg/g for G3
mTerc2/2
mice, p = 0.94, n = 6 each).
Despite normal appearing pancreatic histology, quantitative
fluorescence in situ hybridisation (qFISH) revealed a marked
reduction in telomere fluorescence intensity (TFI) in pancreata of
G3 mTerc2/2
mice (mean TFI: 2,1036102) compared to
mTerc+/+
mice (mean TFI: 4,6836277, p,0.0001, Figure 1B,C).
Reductions in TFI are an established measure of telomere
shortening [17].
Acute phase of cerulein-induced pancreatitis of
telomerase knockout mice is similar to mTerc+/+ mice
It is not known, whether acute inflammatory conditions are
altered in the context of telomere dysfunction. The peak stage of
cerulein-induced pancreatitis occurs 9–12 h after the first cerulein
injection. At this time point, the histological appearance of
cerulein-induced pancreatitis (Figure 2A) and the histological
scoring of pancreatits-associated inflammatory infiltrates, pancre-
atic edema, and necrosis (Figure 2B and Figure S1) revealed no
difference in pancreata of 8-month-old G3 mTerc2/2
mice
compared to mTerc+/+
mice (n = 5 mice per group). Similarly, the
pancreatic wet weight, a measurement for pancreatits-induced
edema, did not show significant differences between the two
cohorts (Figure 2C). Moreover, lipase serum levels (a marker for
acinar cell necrosis) did not reveal significant differences in
cerulein-induced pancreatitis between the two cohorts (Figure 2D).
TUNEL staining revealed similar rates of apoptosis in the
pancreata of G3 mTerc2/2
and mTerc+/+
mice at the peak stage
of cerulein-induced pancreatitis (Figure 2E,F). Together, these
results indicated that telomere shortening did not change the
severity of acute pancreatitis induced by repeated cerulein
injection.
Regeneration after acute pancreatitis is impaired in
telomerase knockout mice
In order to investigate the regeneration from acute cerulein-
induced pancreatitis, pancreatic tissue of mTerc+/+
and G3
mTerc2/2
mice was examined 3 days and 7 days after pancreatitis
induction. In the course of acute cerulein-induced pancreatitis,
pancreata of 8-month-old mTerc+/+
mice had almost completely
regenerated after 3 days (Figure 3A,C). At this time point, age-

matched G3 mTerc2/2
mice showed distinct areas of the exocrine
pancreas with reduced eosin-positive cytoplasm and lack of apical
zymogen granules. Moreover, these areas showed acinar to ductal
metaplasia - a typical feature of cerulein-induced pancreatitis [18].
The metaplastic areas revealed a loss of amylase expression
(Figure 3E,F and Figure S2A,B) and an expansion of ductal
cells with formation of tubular complexes (Figure 3G,H and
Figure S2C,D). A quantification of the amount of these
metaplastic areas revealed a significant difference between the
two cohorts 3 days after cerulein injection (p = 0.048; Figure 3K).
In addition, Sirius red staining 3 days after pancreatitis induction
revealed increased fibrosis in pancreata of G3 mTerc2/2
mice
compared to mTerc+/+
mice (Figure 3I,J).
Apart from an increased occurrence of metaplastic tissue 3 days
after pancreatitis induction, there were no signs of islet
degeneration, evolution of diabetes mellitus, weight loss, or
diarrhea upon 3-week-follow-up of G3 mTerc2/2
mice. Histo-
logically, the pancreata appeared normal on H&E staining after 3
weeks (Figure S3 and data not shown).
Furthermore, proliferating acinar cells were investigated by Ki-
67 staining. No difference in proliferating acinar cells could be
determined in un-stimulated pancreata of both groups
(1.22060.4810 positive cells/high power field (HPF) n = 6 in
mTerc+/+ and 1.17560.5921 positive cells/HPF n = 4 in G3
mTerc2/2
mice, p = 0.62). In contrast, the proliferative response
of acinar cell at day 3 after cerulein-induced pancreatitis was
markedly reduced in G3 mTerc2/2
mice (5.42962.241 Ki-67-
positive cells per high power field, n = 5 mice) compared to
mTerc+/+
mice (33.4365.912 Ki-67 positive cells per high power
field, n = 5, p = 0.008, Figure 4A,B). A similar impairment in
pancreas regeneration of G3 mTerc2/2
mice compared to
mTerc+/+
mice was seen at day 7 after cerulein-induced
pancreatitis (Figure 4A, B). The Ki-67-positive acinar cells were
evaluated in the non-metaplastic areas of the pancreas. In line with

the Ki-67 analysis on cell proliferation, mTerc+/+
mice exhibited a
stronger induction of proliferation markers characterizing the G2/
M stage of the cell cycle (phospho-histone 3 (pH 3) and CDC2)
compared to G3 mTerc2/2
mice (Figure 4C).
DNA damage response in telomere-dysfunctional mice
In order to decipher possible mechanisms limiting pancreas
regeneration in G3 mTerc2/2
mice in response to cerulein-
induced pancreatitis, mediators of the DNA damage response
were analyzed in resting, non-injured pancreata (day 0) and in
damaged pancreata (day 7 after cerulein application). Western blot
analysis revealed an increased expression of p21 in resting, non-
injured pancreata of G3 mTerc2/2
mice compared to mTerc+/+
mice. However, 7 days after cerulein-induced pancreatitis, no
differences in the levels of activated p53 or p21 were observed in
pancreata from G3 mTerc2/2
mice compared to mTerc+/+
mice
(Figure 5). Phosphorylated Chk1 (an upstream kinase inducing
DNA damage responses) was strongly expressed in non-injured
pancreas of G3 mTerc2/2
mice and mTerc+/+
mice. In mTerc+/+
mice, phospho-Chk1 expression declined during pancreas regen-
eration, whereas G3 mTerc2/2
mice failed to inactivate phospho-
Chk1 in response to pancreatic injury (Figure 5).
Discussion
The present study shows that pancreas regeneration in response
to cerulein-induced pancreatitis is impaired in G3 mTerc2/2
mice
with shortened telomeres compared to mTerc+/+
mice with longer
telomere reserve. The experiments revealed no significant
influence of telomere shortening on the severity of pancreatitis
induced by cerulein injection. The severity of pancreatitis was
evaluated histologically by lipase measurement and by pancreatic
wet weight. In addition, TUNEL staining for evaluation of
apoptosis that typically occurs in response to acute pancreatitis,

was performed. Together, these data showed no changes between
G3 mTerc2/2
compared to mTerc+/+
mice indicating that
differences in the regenerative response were not due to differences
in the initiated levels of tissue damage.
The delay in pancreatic regeneration in the context of telomere
shortening was associated with the persistence of metaplastic
exocrine tissue, the formation of tubular complexes, and an
increase in fibrotic tissue at 3 days after tissue injury. Increased
pancreatic fibrosis and tubular complexes are also a hallmark of
human chronic pancreatitis [19,20]. Based on our study, it should
be evaluated whether telomere shortening correlates with the
development of fibrosis and tubular complexes in patients with
chronic pancreatitis. However, up to now it is not known, whether
telomere shortening can be observed in the evolution of human
chronic pancreatitis.
Delayed pancreas regeneration was found to be associated with
impaired proliferation rates in pancreata of cerulein-treated G3
mTerc2/2
mice compared to mTerc+/+
mice. Previous studies
have revealed that proliferating cells seen after acute cerulein-
induced pancreatitis are mainly differentiated acinar cells that
contribute to tissue repair [21]. Studies on telomerase knockout
mice have shown that telomere shortening affects stem cell
compartments of highly proliferative organs and impairs regener-
ation of somatic tissues by activating p21-dependent cell cycle
arrest [22]. In contrast, the current study did not reveal a prono-
unced induction of p53 or p21 in pancreata of G3 mTerc2/2
compared to mTerc+/+ mice. However, G3 mTerc2/2
mice
showed an impaired inactivation of phospho-Chk1 in response to
pancreas injury compared to mTerc+/+
mice. These data suggest
that p53-independent pathways contribute to impairments in
pancreas regeneration in response to telomere shortening possibly
involving Chk1.
It has been shown that transient dedifferentiation and
proliferation of acinar cells is required for exocrine pancreas
regeneration after cerulein damage [21,23]. It is conceivable that
impaired acinar cell regeneration led to delayed pancreas

regeneration and a prolonged persistence of metaplastic tissue in
the pancreata of G3 mTerc2/2
mice compared to mTerc+/+
mice.
However, G3 mTerc2/2
mice did not fail to complete pancreas
regeneration, the process was just delayed. It remains to be
investigated whether a delay in pancreas regeneration could lead
to manifest pancreas defects in the context of chronic organ
damage. If so, telomere shortening could represent a causal factor
influencing disease progression in chronic pancreatitis.
In summary, this study presents the first experimental evidence that
the induction of acute pancreatitis by cerulein treatment is not altered
by telomere shortening in mice. However, telomere shortening was
associated with delayed regeneration after acute pancreatitis appar-
ently involving p53- and p21-independent mechanisms.
Materials and Methods
Animal experiments
mTerc+/+ and mTerc2/2
mice were held in a pathogen-free
area (20–22uC) with free access to food and water.
For the induction of pancreatitis, mice were starved for 18 h
and injected 6 hourly doses of 100 mg/kg cerulein (Takus, Pfizer)
i.p. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points after the first
injection of cerulein.
The animal experiments were approved by the government of
the state of Baden-Wu¨rttemberg (animal protocol number 35/
915.81-3/919).
Histology score
The histology score was calculated blindly by M.W. The score is
based on the level of pancreatic edema, immune cell infiltrate, and
acinar cell necrosis and was determined as previously described [24].
qFISH analysis for telomere length
Telomere length was determined on 5 mm-thick paraffin
sections using quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization
(qFISH) according to previously reported methods [25]. Briefly,
unmasked sections were incubated in pepsine solution (200 mg
pepsine, 168 ml HCL 37%, up to 200 ml H2O) for 6 min at 37uC.
After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, slides were
hybridized with hybridization mix (10 mmol/L Tris pH 7.2;
MgCl2 buffer: 7.02 mmol/L Na2HPO3, 2.14 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.77 mmol/L citric acid; 70% deionized formamide; 0.5 mg/mL
PNA probe 5-Cy3-CCC TAA CCC TAA CCC TAA-3 Applied
Biosystems; 0.25% blocking reagent from Roche) at 80uC for
3 min followed by a 2 h incubation at RT. After washing with
formamide solution (70 ml formamide, 1 ml 1 M Tris pH7,2,
1 ml BSA 10%, up to 100 ml H2O) and phosphate-buffered
saline, sections were mounted with DAPI. The relative telomere
length was determined by quantification of the fluorescence
intensity using TFL software [17].
Lipase measurement
Lipase was measured in serum of the mice in the clinical
chemistry department of the University Hospital of Ulm with the
same protocol and equipment as for routine measurement of human
samples. Before measurement, the serum was diluted 1:4 with PBS.
Immunohistochemistry
H&E staining was performed according to standard procedures.
Quantification of degenerated tissue was performed on serial
pictures of H&E-stained pancreatic tissue (50x magnification; 10
pictures per pancreas) by determination of the degenerated area
using Image J software. The degenerated area was identified by
lack of eosin-positive cytoplasm and disturbed tissue integrity on
H&E-stained sections. These areas were encircled and quantified
using ImageJ (an example is shown in Figure 3A,B).
Immunofluorescence was performed on paraffin-embedded
pancreas using primary anti-amylase (Santa Cruz) and anti-
CK19 (Santa Cruz). Ki-67 immunohistochemistry was performed
on paraffin-embedded pancreas using primary anti-Ki67 (Mono-
san). Primary and secondary antibody dilutions were 1:200 and
1:250, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed on
paraffin-embedded pancreas using primary anti-amylase (Santa
Cruz) and anti-CK19 (Santa Cruz). Primary and secondary
antibody dilutions were 1:100 and 1:200, respectively. For
development ABC Kit (Vector labs) and NovaRed peroxidase
substrate kit (Vector labs) was used. TUNEL staining was
performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche).
Sirius Red staining was performed according to standard
procedures. Sirius red stains fibrotic tissue red. The metaplastic
areas were identified on Sirius red-stained slides by disturbed tissue
morphology and lack of yellow-stained cytoplasm. For amylase
and CK19 staining, at least 3–5 mice per time point and per
genotype were stained and representative pictures were taken. For
Ki-67 staining, non-metaplastic areas of the pancreas were
evaluated since the metaplastic areas are infiltrated by many
immune cells that proliferate and do not represent proliferation of
acinar cells. The magnification of the evaluated pictures was 200x
and the Ki67-positive cells per picture was determined.
Immunoblot analysis
Whole-cell extracts were prepared according to standard
protocols and tested by western blot using anti-P21 (Santa Cruz),
anti-pP53 (Cell Signalling), anti-pChk1 (Cell Signalling), anti-Cdc2
(Santa Cruz), anti-pH3 (Santa Cruz), and anti-GAPDH (Bethyl
laboratory). Dilutions of the primary and secondary antibodies were
1:1,000 1:10,000, respectively. Western blots were performed on
pooled samples of n = 3–5 pancreata per time point and genotype.
Blood sugar measurement
Blood sugar was measured using a glucometer (OneTouch
Ultra) by withdrawing blood from the tail vene of non-starved
mice in the afternoon.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism using
rank-based Mann-Whitney test.
