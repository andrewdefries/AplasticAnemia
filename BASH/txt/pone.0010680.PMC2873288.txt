Abstract
Background: Telomerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the addition of nucleotides on the ends of chromosomes. Rare loss of
function mutations in the gene that encodes the protein component of telomerase (TERT) have been described in patients
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here we examine the telomere lengths and pulmonary fibrosis phenotype seen in
multiple kindreds with heterozygous TERT mutations.
Methods and Findings: We have identified 134 individuals with heterozygous TERT mutations from 21 unrelated families.
Available medical records, surgical lung biopsies and radiographs were evaluated retrospectively. Genomic DNA isolated
from circulating leukocytes has been used to measure telomere lengths with a quantitative PCR assay. We find that
telomere lengths of TERT mutation carriers decrease in an age-dependent manner and show progressive shortening with
successive generations of mutation inheritance. Family members without TERT mutations have a shorter mean telomere
length than normal, demonstrating epigenetic inheritance of shortened telomere lengths in the absence of an inherited
TERT mutation. Pulmonary fibrosis is an age-dependent phenotype not seen in mutation carriers less than 40 years of age
but found in 60% of men 60 years or older; its development is associated with environmental exposures including cigarette
smoking. A radiographic CT pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which is consistent with a diagnosis of IPF, is seen
in 74% of cases and a pathologic pattern of UIP is seen in 86% of surgical lung biopsies. Pulmonary fibrosis associated with
TERT mutations is progressive and lethal with a mean survival of 3 years after diagnosis. Overall, TERT mutation carriers
demonstrate reduced life expectancy, with a mean age of death of 58 and 67 years for males and females, respectively.
Conclusions: A subset of pulmonary fibrosis, like dyskeratosis congenita, bone marrow failure, and liver disease, represents
a ‘‘telomeropathy’’ caused by germline mutations in telomerase and characterized by short telomere lengths. Family
members within kindreds who do not inherit the TERT mutation have shorter telomere lengths than controls,
demonstrating epigenetic inheritance of a shortened parental telomere length set-point.

Introduction
Telomerase is a multimeric ribonucleoprotein enzyme that
catalyzes the addition of repetitive DNA sequence to telomeres,
specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes. The human
enzyme consists of both a functional RNA (hTR) and a reverse
transcriptase protein component (hTERT)[1,2]. Its action on
telomeres solves the end-replication problem by counteracting the
progressive shortening of the chromosome that occurs with each
cell division. hTERT is highly expressed in germ cells, cells with
proliferative potential and immortalized cancer cells[3,4,5].
Telomerase activity is restricted in humans. Evidence of this is
seen by the progressive shortening of telomere lengths of human
mononuclear leukocytes with age[6] and several diseases of
inherited telomerase dysfunction[7]. Mutations in the genes
encoding the telomerase complex were first found in patients with
dyskeratosis congenita (DKC), and then in patients with bone
marrow failure syndromes, pulmonary fibrosis and liver disease.
While these are very different clinical diseases, a subset of each
share a common pathogenesis related to short telomere lengths
due to inherited germline telomerase mutations. DKC is a very
rare multisystem disorder (prevalence of 1 in one million
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 5 | e10680
individuals) affecting children. Most DKC patients have mutations
in the X-linked DKC1 gene, which encodes dyskerin[8]; fewer
patients have mutations in TERC, which encodes hTR[9]. Case
reports of rare kindreds have been described with mutations in
TERT[10], NOP10[11], NHP2[12] and TINF2[13], which encode
different components of the telomerase and the telomere complex.
DKC is considered a syndrome of premature aging with death
occurring at a median age of 16 years and a maximum of 50,
usually from bone marrow failure, cancer or pulmonary
disease[14].
Like DKC, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal
disease; patients have a median survival of approximately 3–5
years after diagnosis[15]. However, unlike DKC, IPF is much
more common with its prevalence increasing with age to 65 cases
per 100,000 for those 75 years or older [16]. Heterozygous loss-of-
function mutations in TERT have been found in up to 15% of
kindreds with the familial pulmonary fibrosis[17,18] and in 1–3%
of sporadic cases[19,20]. IPF is one of the most common
interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), a heterogeneous collection of lung
disorders affecting mainly the supporting structures (interstitium)
of the lung. A diagnosis of IPF portends a much worse prognosis
than most other ILDs and predicts the lack of a therapeutic
response with prednisone, which is commonly used to treat other
ILDs[15]. Within our initial reports of heterozygous TERT
mutation carriers, most affected with pulmonary fibrosis were
diagnosed with IPF but some had a granulomatous lung disease or
pulmonary fibrosis which was not consistent with IPF. This raises
the question of the actual spectrum of pulmonary phenotypes
associated with TERT mutations.
Using probands initially identified with heterozygous TERT
mutations and pulmonary fibrosis, we have expanded these
families to identify 134 carriers of heterozygous TERT mutations,
ranging in age from 5 to 88, with a mean age of 51 years. We have
collected information regarding their medical history and
environmental and occupational exposures. Here we show that
40% of TERT mutation carriers with a mean age of 51 years have
self-reported pulmonary fibrosis, which is usually but not always
clinically consistent with IPF. The relative frequencies of bone
marrow dysplasias, cancer and other diseases are described for this
cohort. Telomere lengths of mutation carriers in successive
generations of the three largest kindreds show progressive telomere
shortening. Related family members who do not inherit the TERT
mutation have shorter telomeres than controls, demonstrating
epigenetic inheritance of a shortened parental telomere set-point.
Methods
Human Subjects
This study was approved by the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Co-
horts of familial pulmonary fibrosis kindreds and sporadic cases of
idiopathic interstitial pneumonias were collected as described[19].
Each sporadic case and at least one member of each kindred with
familial pulmonary fibrosis carried a diagnosis of IPF or
unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia in concordance to established
criteria[15]. Written informed consent was obtained from all
subjects. Each participant completed a questionnaire and self-
reported their ethnicity, medical history, pulmonary symptoms,
and exposures to fibrogenic medications, radiation and particu-
lates. Medical records, open lung biopsy samples and radiographic
studies were obtained when available. Genomic DNA was isolated
from circulating leukocytes with an Autopure LS (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) or from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archived
tissue using the QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA
samples for the population of normal control subjects (n = 195, age
19–89 years) were obtained from a cohort of unrelated,
multiethnic individuals from Dallas, Texas kindly provided by
H. H. Hobbs.
CT Chest Scan Analysis
Available CT scans of the chest were obtained from different
US medical centers and were independently reviewed by a chest
radiologist (J.D.G.). Each scan was categorized as ‘‘typical or UIP’’
as defined in [15] with peripheral and basal reticulations, traction
bronchiectasis and honeycombing. Those deemed ‘‘consistent with
UIP’’ lacked honeycombing.
Surgical Lung Biopsy Analysis
Available lung biopsies were independently reviewed by a
pulmonary pathologist (A.-L.K.).
Sequencing and Mutation Analysis
Sequencing of both TERT and TERC were performed as
described[18].
Determination of Telomere Length
Genomic DNA was quantitated in triplicate using a ND-8000
spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies; Wilmington, DE),
stored at 50 ng/ml in TE (10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA),
diluted to 2 ng/ml in water and added as a 20 ng aliquot to the
final reaction. Multiplexed quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) determination of telomere lengths were performed on a
RotorGene real-time PCR system (Qiagen) as described[21] with
0.15X SYBR Green I (Invitrogen) and the single copy Albumin
gene primers at a final concentration of 500 nM. A standard curve
was generated using serially diluted genomic DNA (ranging from 5
to 40 ng) pooled from 5 control individuals. Reference DNA
isolated from cell line MCF7 (ATCC Cat#HTB-22), which has
very short telomeres, and two control individuals were included on
each run. RotorGene Q Software version 1.7.94 was used for the
construction of standard curves and crossing point (Ct) values. T/S
ratios were calculated as previously described[19]. Each sample
was assayed in triplicate. The final reported T/S value is the
average T/S from two independent experiments. The relative T/S
ratio was calculated by dividing the sample T/S value by the T/S
value of the reference MCF7.
Telomerase Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) Assay
Missense mutations in the TERT gene were introduced into the
parental plasmid pGRN125 and TRAP assays were performed as
described[19].
Statistical Methods
Analyses on quantitative traits were performed by fitting linear
models and contingency tables were tested by using Fisher’s exact
test. All analyses were performed with the R software package,
version 2.8.1 (www.r-project.org). The log transformed relative
T/S ratio was normally distributed.
Results
We have identified 21 different families with heterozygous
coding mutations in the gene encoding the protein component of
telomerase, TERT (Figure 1 and Table S1). Most of the families
have been previously reported[18,19]. Eight have been identified
more recently and all have been more fully expanded. From our
collection of 106 unrelated kindreds with familial pulmonary

fibrosis, 19 (18%) have been found with heterozygous TERT
mutations. Previously, we reported that in a group of unrelated
individuals with an idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and no family
history of pulmonary fibrosis in a first or second-degree family
member, 2 (3%) had a TERT mutation. We have also expanded
these two families (S957R and R865C in Figure 1) and included
them in the analysis. All of the missense mutations involve
conserved residues in regions of the protein that have postulated
roles in enzyme activity; none of the mutations were reported in a
multiethnic panel of 528 controls[22] or are present in the SNP
database. Two of the mutations (V144M and R951W) have been
found in different unrelated families[18]. All the new mutations
(R631Q, R671W, V867M, H925Q, R951W and G1063S) have
not been identified previously and demonstrate reduced in vitro
telomerase activity as measured by the telomere repeat amplica-
tion protocol (TRAP) assay (Figure S1). All probands have been
sequenced for the entire coding exons and flanking introns of
TERT and TERC. Only the families with TERT mutations have
been included in this analysis.
Direct genomic DNA sequencing for the proband’s TERT
mutation in the expanded families identified 134 heterozygous
TERT mutation carriers with a mean age of 51 years. For some
deceased individuals, archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded
tissue was obtained and directly sequenced for the mutation. Only

individuals for whom the mutation was directly sequenced or
could be inferred based upon the family structure have been
included in our analysis. Most of the mutation carriers come from
three large pedigrees (Figure 1). The self-described ethnicity of
90% of mutation carriers is white, the remainder is Hispanic.
Each subject completed a medical questionnaire including self-
reporting of medical diagnoses; these were confirmed with medical
records when available. Forty percent of the mutation carriers are
affected with pulmonary fibrosis and almost half reported one of
the following respiratory diseases: pulmonary fibrosis, obstructive
sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma or
previous pneumothorax. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is
reported by 26%, with gastritis and/or peptic ulcer disease found
in ,8%. Eight percent of patients have elevated liver function tests
and for one of these, cryptogenic liver cirrhosis was diagnosed.
Osteopenia and/or osteoporosis are reported by over one-fourth
of mutation carriers. Over 15% have at least one blood dyscrasia;
mild anemia is more common than aplastic anemia or myelodys-
plastic syndrome combined. The relative frequencies of other
diseases are listed in Table 1.
Telomere length of genomic DNA isolated from circulating
leukocytes was determined using a modified multiplexed
quantitative PCR assay. In short, this assay assesses the telomere
length as a ratio of the telomere copy repeats to a single copy
gene, relative to a reference sample. We have observed good
correlation between this method and the standard Southern-blot
method (terminal restriction fragment length analysis) for
determining telomere length (Spearman’s rank correlation = 0.83,
P-value ,2.2610216
, Figure S2). We found that those with a
TERT mutation (n = 86) have significantly shorter telomere
lengths than an unrelated healthy cohort ranging in age from
19–89 years of age (P-value = 2.4610238
, Figure 2B, 2C).
Approximately 80% of TERT mutation carriers fell below the
10th
percentile of the reference group; all were shorter than the
50th
percentile (Figure 2B). Most of the TERT mutation carriers
with pulmonary fibrosis, blood dyscrasias or liver cirrhosis were
40 years of age or older. The age-related decline in telomere
lengths of the TERT mutation carriers was similar to that of the
normal controls.
When comparing telomere lengths between individuals, the
values are age-adjusted and reported as an observed minus
expected value (O-E value) (Figure 2C, 2D). There was no
difference between telomere lengths of the reference population
and the unrelated spouses, but we find that the mean telomere
length of related family members without a TERT mutation was
significantly shorter than the reference population (P-value =
1.0161025
). For the three largest kindreds, we were able to
estimate a minimal number of generations through which the
TERT mutation segregated. For these three families, the mean
telomere length of the TERT mutation carriers progressively
shortened for each TERT-carrying generation, G3 through G5
(Figure 2C) (Linear trend test P-value = 0.04). The spread of
telomere lengths of TERT mutation carriers was sufficiently broad
to partially overlap the spectrum of lengths seen in the normal
controls, spouses and related family members. We also studied the
telomere lengths of children of TERT mutation carriers that did
not inherit their grandparents’ and parents’ mutation (G2+1) and
compared these to age-matched controls. Although not statistically
significant, there was again a trend toward shorter telomere
lengths of children without a TERT mutation who were born to
TERT carriers corresponding to the number of successive
generations the mutation segregated in the family. We investigated
the telomere lengths as related by genotype and parental gender
(Figure 2D). The telomere lengths of children who inherited a

TERT mutation were shorter if the mutant allele was transmitted
from the father rather than the mother, even after adjusting for the
sex of the child (P-value = 0.01). A TERT mutation not
transmitted from parent to child led to an increase in telomere
length, regardless of parental gender, that did not reach the mean
telomere length of controls.
Since pulmonary fibrosis is common in TERT mutation
carriers, we sought to more carefully characterize the clinical
interstitial lung disease phenotype (Table 2). We obtained and
independently reviewed all available medical records and archived
radiographic and pathologic specimens for those with a self-
reported or family-reported diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Only
older adults were affected, with diagnoses made between 42 to 83
years of age. In general, men were more commonly affected (60%)
than women (40%) and had an earlier clinical presentation, with a
mean age of 54 vs. 63 years, respectively. Dyspnea and crackles
were almost uniformly seen.
Pulmonary function tests and diffusion capacity measurements
were available for a subset of those with pulmonary fibrosis
(Table 3). All affected individuals had a decrease in the diffusion
capacity, a cardinal parameter of IPF. In addition, the majority
had evidence of restrictive physiology.

TERT Mutation Lung Fibrosis

Over half were former or current smokers with a mean 21 pack-
year cigarette smoking history. Each of the living TERT mutation
carriers completed a pulmonary questionnaire that included self-
reported drug, radiation, occupational or environmental exposures
that have been linked to the development of pulmonary fibrosis.
Over ninety-five percent of TERT mutation carriers with
pulmonary fibrosis report an exposure to smoking and/or a
fibrogenic environmental or occupational agent that may have
contributed to the development of their interstitial lung disease.
There appears to be a significant association between smoking
and/or fibrogenic exposures with pulmonary fibrosis in TERT
mutation carriers who are $40 years of age. (Table 4).
Radiographs, including CT scans of the chest, were evaluated
for 39 different cases. For 29 (74%) subjects, the pattern of
pulmonary fibrosis was typical for UIP, that is, there was patchy
reticulation concentrated in the periphery and bases which was
accompanied by honeycombing (Table 2). Honeycombing was
generally mild or moderate, but occasionally severe. For 5
subjects, the pattern of fibrosis was consistent with UIP except
for an absence of honeycombing. For the remaining 5 subjects, the
CT scans were atypical of UIP because the fibrosis was
predominantly located in the mid or upper lung fields or along
the bronchi. Figure 3 shows representative CT scans typical of
UIP, consistent with UIP but without honeycombing, and atypical
for UIP. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (exceeding 1 cm in the
short axis) were found in 15 (38%) cases. Sixteen cases included
expiratory scans, which detected air-trapping in 6 cases. All cases
with a radiographic pattern typical or consistent with UIP had a
pathologic diagnosis of UIP (n = 21; Table 5). Regardless of the
specific radiographic pattern, all subjects with serial CT
radiographs (n = 19) showed progression.
Lung biopsy specimens from 29 cases, including 22 surgical
biopsies and 8 explants (both biopsy and explant were available for
one case) were reviewed independently. The majority (25 cases or
86%) had diagnostic histologic features of UIP with a character-
istic heterogeneous mixture of interstitial fibrosis containing both
collagen deposition and fibroblast foci, islands of normal lung, and
areas of architectural distortion with parenchymal scarring and/or
honeycomb change. In 10 cases (35%) chronic inflammation,
consisting of a mixture of lymphocytes and plasma cells, was
increased in the scarred areas of the lung and in adjacent
interstitium compared to that usually seen in typical UIP. Another
unusual feature seen in 5 cases (17%) was the presence of scattered
histiocytes and/or small, loose non-necrotizing granulomas within
the interstitium (Table 5); these are also not usually seen in typical
UIP. Areas of acute lung injury, including bronchiolitis obliterans-
organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)
were superimposed on UIP in 4 cases, and were indicative of the
accelerated form of UIP/IPF. Four cases could not be classified as
UIP. The diagnosis in one could not be established because of the
extent of DAD superimposed on the honeycomb change.
Clinically, this subject was diagnosed with interstial pneumonitis
and died less than 8 weeks from the start of her symptoms
(Table 5). One case showed only BOOP along with unclassifiable
subpleural fibrosis; this subject died from respiratory failure
secondary to ‘‘COPD and pulmonary fibrosis’’ four years from
diagnosis. Another case had chronic interstitial pneumonia with
fibrosis that could not be further classified; this subject died 14
months after the surgical lung biopsy was obtained. A final case
contained only a minute fragment of subpleural scar that was
considered insufficient for diagnosis. For all four non-classifiable
cases, the biopsies were taken from a single lobe.
Pulmonary fibrosis for TERT mutation carriers is an age-
related phenotype. None of the mutation carriers were diagnosed
with pulmonary fibrosis prior to 40 years of age. The penetrance
of pulmonary fibrosis increased to 60% and 50% for men and
women, respectively, $60 years of age (Figure 4A). Individuals

heterozygous for TERT mutations died at an early age. For 29
male mutation carriers, the average age of death was 57.7. For 24
female mutation carriers, the average age of death was 66.6. In
comparison, the life expectancy of individuals in the US in 2006
was 75.1 and 80.2 for men and women, respectively[23]. For
most of the TERT mutation carriers, the cause of death was
related to respiratory insufficiency. On average, the mean life
expectancy of TERT mutation carriers with pulmonary fibrosis
was 3 years from the time of diagnosis (Figure 4B). We find that
a heterozygous TERT mutation status predicted a clinical
outcome of progressive pulmonary fibrosis that mirrors the
clinical course of IPF.
Discussion
Genetic mutations in the TERT gene are the most frequent
molecular defect found in patients with autosomal dominant
pulmonary fibrosis. This disease can be considered a ‘‘telomero-
pathy,’’ like DKC, bone marrow failure and liver disease, when
caused by germline mutations in telomerase and characterized by
short telomere lengths. In this study, we describe the spectrum of
diseases associated with heterozygous TERT mutations. This
study was biased toward collecting subjects with pulmonary
disease as the probands of each family were all collected based
upon their known diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. However, as

TERT Mutation Lung Fibrosis

we expanded the kindreds, we discovered many other TERT
mutation carriers with a similar phenotype. Overall, 40% of 134
TERT mutation carriers with a mean age of 51 carry a diagnosis
of pulmonary fibrosis. All TERT mutations were discovered in
individuals of white or Hispanic ancestry, similar to previous
reports[18,19].
This study demonstrates several similarities and differences
between the different ‘‘telomeropathies.’’ First, the cardinal
features of DKC, reticulated hyperpigmented skin, oral mucosal
leukoplakia and dystrophic nails, are not seen in this cohort of
TERT mutation carriers. Second, the age at the onset of disease
can be very different. DKC is a usually a disease of childhood;
bone marrow failure due to TERT mutations can affect individuals
of a wide range of ages[24]. In contrast, the pulmonary fibrosis
phenotype is age-dependent. None of the TERT mutation carriers
less than 40 years of age have pulmonary fibrosis, but 60% and
50% of men and women, respectively, have pulmonary fibrosis at
$60 years of age. Third, the clinical spectrum of disease seen in
these TERT mutation carriers is milder than seen with DKC.
Over 85% of DKC patients have a manifestation of bone marrow
failure, 20% have pulmonary disease, and fewer have premature
graying, extensive dental loss, esophageal strictures, peptic
ulceration and an increased cancer predisposition[25]. Here we
find aplastic anemia in 2 TERT mutation carriers, but isolated
anemia in 18 individuals. Similarly, crytogenic liver cirrhosis is
found in one TERT mutation carrier, but elevated liver function
tests are seen in 11 individuals. Three other individuals for whom
genomic DNA was not available for sequence analysis died from
hepatitis-related liver cirrhosis. This is consistent with a recent
report of a wide spectrum of familial liver disease in kindreds with
telomerase mutations, including two TERT mutation families [26].
While bone marrow dysfunction or liver cirrhosis can be found
concurrently with pulmonary fibrosis, these diseases are frequently
found in different individuals. The compilation of diseases related
to telomerase dysfunction seen in different members of the same
family rather than in the same individual is a common feature of
the TERT kindreds. The observations in these families suggest that
the penetrance of the TERT mutation is incomplete, though
substantial (,40%) in causing pulmonary fibrosis and that
expression is highly variable.
The ‘‘telomeropathies’’ are related to each other due to a
shared pathogenic mechanism of telomere shortening. While
telomere lengths are short in this TERT cohort, they are not as
short as is usually seen with DKC patients. For the TERT
mutation carriers in this study, 79% have telomere lengths
shorter than the 10th
percentile and 56% have lengths shorter
Figure 3. Radiographic and pathologic findings of heterozygous TERT mutation carriers with pulmonary fibrosis. Computed
tomography (CT) scans of three different subjects with pulmonary fibrosis. Representative cases are shown with a pattern typical of Usual Interstitial
Pneumonia (UIP) with peripheral, basal-predominant fibrosis and moderate to severe honeycombing (A,B), a pattern consistent with UIP with
peripheral, basal-predominant fibrosis in the absence of honeycombing (C,D), and a pattern atypical for UIP with fibrosis predominantly affecting the
upper lobes and along the bronchi (E, F). Scans are shown at the level of the carina (A, C, E) and the lung base (B, D, F). The majority (25 cases or
86%) of TERT mutation carriers with lung specimens available for review had diagnostic histologic features of UIP. In this low magnification view of
UIP (G), typical variegated honeycomb areas (top right) are seen alternating with normal areas (left) and scarred lung (bottom). The case shown in (H)
shows increased inflammation and a small, loosely aggregated non-necrotizing granuloma (arrows) that is characterized by a cluster of epitheloid
histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells surrounded by chronic inflammation in the interstitium. Panels G and H are shown at 40 and 100-fold
magnification, respectively.

than the 1st
percentile of healthy controls. In contrast, 100% of
DKC patients have lengths below the 1st
percentile of
normals[27]. We see an age-dependent decline in telomere
length for the TERT mutation carriers. In contrast, an age-
dependent decline is not seen in DKC patients perhaps because
the affected individuals may have already reached their minimal
telomere lengths[28,29].
Autosomal dominant DKC due to mutations in TERC, which
encodes hTR, or TERT can demonstrate disease anticipation with
increasing severity and an earlier onset in successive generations
[10,30]. The anticipation is due to inheritance of both shorter
telomeres and the parental telomerase mutation. Here we show
that although disease or death can occur earlier in successive
generations, anticipation is not the rule for all the TERT kindreds.
Given the lethality of pulmonary fibrosis and the late onset of this
disease, DNA samples from individuals belonging to preceding
generations were not available. However, evaluation of telomere
lengths of DNA samples of following generations of TERT
mutations has shown a statistical trend toward further telomere
shortening for three large kindreds. Transmission of the TERT
mutation from the father, rather than the mother, led to shorter
mean telomere lengths of the children. Whether these short
telomere lengths are due to the number of cell divisions of the
spermatogonia, relative to the egg, prior to fertilization or to sex-
related genomic imprinting is not clear. However, this finding is
similar to other reports of a strong paternal influence on telomere
length[31,32].
We see shortening of telomere lengths for family members who
are wild-type for both TERT alleles in comparison with two
reference groups: healthy unrelated controls and spouses marrying
into the family. These family members have evidence of telomere
shortening in the absence of a TERT mutation; their telomere

shortening represents an epigenetic modification that has been
stably inherited from the parent with a TERT mutation. Inherited
short telomere lengths in the absence of telomerase mutations have
been reported previously in one large TERC kindred[28] and have
been elegantly studied in mice. Genetic breeding strategies have
produced mice with short telomere lengths; these exhibit
degenerative defects even though telomerase is wildtype[33,34].
We have previously reported that ,25% of human subjects with
the sporadic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias have short telomere
lengths (,10th
percentile) in the absence of telomerase muta-
tions[19], suggesting a role of this epigenetic modification in the
development of non-familial pulmonary fibrosis. It is currently
unknown whether human family members in these TERT
kindreds have any clinical phenotypes that may be associated
with short telomere lengths in the absence of an inherited
telomerase mutation.
A major limitation of this study is that it is a family-based
observational study. Due to ascertainment bias, the prevalence
of pulmonary fibrosis is likely much higher for this group than a
randomly collected population-based cohort with telomerase
mutations. Although the questionnaires were completed pro-
spectively by subject participants, medical records and studies
were reviewed retrospectively. Not all subjects underwent the
same work up for each medical diagnosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is
an age-related phenotype and relevant clinical data was missing
for many of the historical cases. CT scans of the chest were not
widely performed prior to 1980. In addition, pathology review
was not possible for all since many of the affected individuals
had not undergone surgical lung biopsies. The exposure data is
also fraught with recollection bias; those with lung disease may
be more likely to remember the occupational or environmental
exposures that they later have been told are associated with
pulmonary fibrosis. It is also difficult to retrospectively
quantitate past life-long respiratory exposures or obtain
accurate exposure histories from deceased individuals. Despite
these limitations, the pulmonary phenotype was characterized
with available data.
Most of the originally reported TERT mutation cases had IPF,
but some did not fit the narrow diagnostic criteria for this
disease[18,19]. One goal was to determine what percent of TERT
mutation carriers represent IPF using modern diagnostic crite-
ria[15]. The interstitial lung disease associated with the TERT
mutations is characterized uniformly by dyspnea and a decreased
diffusion capacity. Almost three-fourths have a radiographic
pattern of pulmonary fibrosis that is typical of IPF. However,
13% have a pattern that is atypical for IPF, either with reticulation
that is upper or mid-lung zone predominant or fibrosis that occurs
along bronchi. An upper lung predominant pattern of fibrosis can
be consistent with clinical diagnoses of sarcoidosis, pneumoconi-
oses or chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, diagnoses which
some of these individuals carried. However, despite a wide range
of treatment courses, pulmonary fibrosis was progressive with a
mean survival of 3 years from diagnosis. There seemed to be no
difference in the radiologic and pathologic patterns related to
specific TERT mutations.
The coexistence of inflammation and fibrosis may be a
characteristic of organ disease associated with telomerase
mutations. Over 35% of the chest CT scans showed enlarged
mediastinal lymph nodes, a radiographic finding that is usually
not seen with IPF. While UIP was the predominant pathologic
feature in surgical lung specimens, 17% also had scattered
histiocytes and/or non-necrotizing granulomas and 35% had
increased amounts of interstitial inflammation. These features
seen in the absence of UIP generally portend a better response
to immunosuppressant medication. Liver disease associated
with telomerase mutations is heterogeneous in severity and
pathology with findings of co-existent fibrosis and inflamma-
tion[26].
Over ninety-five percent of the TERT mutation carriers have
smoked or had an exposure to a fibrogenic agent that has been
linked to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. This suggests a
role of environmental factors in triggering lung injury in a tissue
that is more susceptible. Some of the variable expressivity of the
clinical phenotype of TERT mutation carriers may be related to
environmental injury of susceptible cells and organs, with possible
influences from other genetic and epigenetic factors. Since there is
reduced penetrance of lung fibrosis even for the oldest age bracket,
modification of environmental exposures may prevent or delay the
onset of disease for those who have inherited this genetic risk. In
the upcoming era of genomic medicine, it will become imperative
