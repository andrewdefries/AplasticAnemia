Genetic Aspects of Toxicity during Development
by Daniel W. Nebert,: Snorri S. Thorgeirsson,* and George H. LambertR
The Ah locus in the mouse controls the induction of cytochrome P,450 and at least eleven asso-
ciated monooxygenase activities. These enzyme systems metabolically potentiate and detoxify
drugs, environmental pollutants, and other foreign chemicals, as well as numerous endogenous
substrates. For certain substrates, it is known that cytochrome P,-450 produces different reactive
intermediates and products that other forms of P-450. Alleles at the Ah locus can be identified in
utero. Developmental toxicity lin the form of stillborns, resorptions, and malformations of the
fetus) by 3-methylcholanthrene and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene given to the pregnant mother
is associated with genetically mediated aromatic hydrocarbon responsiveness in C57BL/6N mice,
compared with that in nonresponsive AKR/N mice. Acetaminiphen-produced hepatic necrosis is
associated with glutathione depletion in the liver, covalent binding of metabolite( s) of the drug to
cellular macromolecules, and P,-450 induction controlled by the Ah locus. For reasons not
known, the fetus and mice 10 days of age or less are relatively resistant to glutathione depletion
and therefore hepatic necrosis by acetaminophen.
Introduction
The theme of this conference is evaluation of
methods routinely used to assess developmental
toxicity. Toxic effects on the developing embryo
and fetus will be either environmental or genetic.
This review will combine environmental and gen-
etic factors, since our laboratory for the past 8
years has studied genetic differences in enzyme
systems that metabolize drugs and other envi-
ronmental agents.
Xenobiotics (foreign compounds) are, in gener-
al, hydrophobic chemicals that are metabolized
by a group of enzymes known collectively as the
cytochrome P-450-mediated monooxygenases
(1-5). These membrane-bound enzyme systems
are known to metabolize: polycyclic aromatic hy-
drocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene (ubiquitous in
city smog, cigarette smoke, and charcoal-cooked
foods) and biphenyl; halogenated hydrocarbons
such as polychlorinated biphenyls, insecticides,
and ingredients in soaps and deodorants; strong
mutagens such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitro-

soguanidine and nitrosamines; aminoazo dyes and
diazo compounds; N-acetylarylamines and nitro-
furans; numerous aromatic amines (found in hair
dyes), nitro aromatics, and heterocyclics; epoxi-
des; carbamates; alkyl halides; safrole deriva-
tives; certain fungal toxins and antibiotics; many
of the chemotherapeutic agents used to treat hu-
man cancer; most drugs; both endogenous and
synthetic steroids; and other endogenous com-
pounds such as biogenic amines, indoles, thyrox-
ine, and fatty acids. These enzyme systems may
metabolically potentiate the detrimental effects
of an inert parent compound by converting it to a
reactive or toxic intermediate [benzo [a]pyrene is
an example (6,7)] or may detoxify a reactive par-
ent compound to an inactive product
[N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine is an ex-
ample (8)]. By "reactive" intermediate or parent
compound, we mean an alkylating or arylating
agent (usually an electrophile) capable of random
damage to critical cellular macromolecules,
thereby leading to toxic effects, mutation and
cancer, or toxicity during development (i.e., birth
defects).
The delicate balance in each tissue between en-
zymes which potentiate and those which detoxify
highly reactive intermediates is being increasing-
December 1976 35
ly appreciated. This balance may be effectively
altered by differences in genetics, age, hormonal
or nutritional balance, circadian rhythmicity, and
enzyme stimulation (induction) or inhibition due
to drug-drug interactions. A myriad of alter-
native pathways, illustrated in the simple scheme
shown in Figure 1, typifies the means by which
xenobiotics are metabolized in the body.

FIGURE 1.
If compound A, for example, causes toxicity, any
factor increasing enzyme 1 or 5 would decrease
the steady-state level of compound A and there-
fore decrease its toxic effects. If compound A re-
quires potentiation to reactive intermediate B,
any factor increasing enzyme 2,3, or 5 or decreas-
ing enzyme 1 would decrease the steady-state
level of the reactive intermediate and therefore
decrease its toxic effects. In either event, if other
more distant enzymes such as 2, 4, or 7 were
rate-limiting for the overall pathway, a factor
changing the level of such an enzyme could be
most important in affecting the steady-state level
of compound A or B.
Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylase "Activity"
Evidence from this laboratory was presented
(9) five years ago for a single gene difference be-
tween C57BL/6N (B6) and DBA/2N (D2) inbred
mouse strains in the induction of a monooxy-
genase activity, hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hy-
droxylase (AHH), and newly formed cytochrome
PA-450 by 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) treatment.
Figure 2 illustrates the AHH assay in vitro.
Figure 3 shows the extent of hepatic AHH induc-
tion by MC in B6 and D2 mice as a function of age.
The basal enzyme activity in either mouse strain
in detectable during the last 5 days of gestation
and increases rapidly during the first week post-
natally. The phenomenon of this "physiological"
increase in hepatic monooxygenase activity oc-
curring immediately postpartum is not well
understood but presumably is similar to the ap-
pearance of enzymes metabolizing, for example,

FIGURE 2. Current concept of the aryl hydrocarbon (benzo[a]

benzo[a]pyrene is oxygenated to an arene oxide which rear-
ranges nonenzymically to the phenol. Oxygenation via direct
oxygen insertion (1) is a second possible mechanism. Other
oxygenated derivatives of benzo[a]pyrene, including
dihydrodiols and quinones, are not measured by this assay
(4,10).
chloramphenicol or bilirubin. Related clinical en-
tities are the Gray Baby Syndrome (12) and neo-
natal hyperbilirubinemia, in which the newborn
and especially the premature have not yet devel-
oped the necessary microsomal enzymes for me-
tabolizing chloramphenicol and bilirubin, re-
spectively. MC transplacentally induces fetal
hepatic AHH to detectable levels 9 days before
parturition in B6 mice, and the capacity for induc-
tion increases markedly around the time of birth
to reach maximal levelsCat 1 to 3 weeks of age.
AHH induction by MC does not develop in the D2
mouse at any age. We therefore conclude that,
during the more than 60 years' existence of the
D2 inbred mouse strain, there has evolved a
stable mutation (to some advantage for the D2
animal) in which there is no response to the
foreign compound MC. And the normal (wild-
type) response, as seen in B6 mice, is to increase
the level of an enzyme which in turn metabolizes
the polycyclic hydrocarbon inducer, so that the
hydrophobic xenobiotic may be converted to
more polar intermediates and products which can
be readily excreted from the cell and from the
body.
Studies by several laboratories of more than 30
inbred strains (4) indicate that about two-thirds
of the mouse strains are genetically "responsive"
(i.e., AHH inducible by aromatic polycyclic com-
pounds) like wild-type or B6 mice and about one-
third is "nonresponsive" like the D2 strain. It ap-
pears that the mutation in nonresponsive mice in-
volves a defective cytosol protein receptor (4,13)
and that nonresponsive mice have the necessary
regulatory and structural genes for AHH induc-
tion by very potent polycyclic aromatic inducers;
this subject, however, is beyond the scope of this
report.

FIGURE 3. Hepatic levels of the basal aryl hydrocarbon
hydroxylase activity and of the enzyme activity in response
to MC treatment of C57BL/6N and DBA/2N mice, as a func-
tion of age (11): (@) mean hydroxylase specific activity from
individual livers of 6-15 mice 24 hr after the intraperitoneal
administration of 80 mg MC/kg of body weight; (o) mean
enzyme activity from individual livers of 5-12 mice 24 hr
after treatment with corn oil alone. The standard deviations
of each group were always less than 25% and usually less
than 15% of the mean specific activity. The closed circles
depicting hydroxylase activity before birth represent the
average specific activity found in five or more individual
livers from a litter of fetuses whose mother had received in-
traperitoneally MC 24 hr. before; the closed circles on day
"zero" indicate the mean enzyme activity from individual
mice born within 24 hr after their mother had received the
MC. Specific activity on the ordinate represents units per
mg of total liver homogenate protein. A unit of AHH activity
is defined (9) as that amount of enzyme catalyzing for 1 min
at 37Â°C the formation of products the fluorescence of which
is equivalent to 1 pmole of 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene
recrystallized standard.
Genetics of Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylase
Induction by Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds
AHH induction by MC is expressed almost ex-
clusively as a single autosomal dominant trait
(9,11,14,15) when B6 and D2 strains are used.
When other strains are crossed (4) however, the
simplest genetic model which can be offered in-
volves a minimum of six alleles at a minimum of
two genetic loci. For our genetic experimental
model system, we therefore routinely use off-
spring from the appropriate crosses between B6
and D2 parent strains: Ahb is the dominant allele
for responsiveness; Ahd is the recessive allele,
the Ahd/Ahd animal being genetically nonrespon-
sive.
The autosomal dominant trait for AHH induc-
tion by polycyclic hydrocarbons was found to be
expressed more or less dominantly in nonhepatic
tissues as well (4,14). A careful dose-response
curve of AHH inducers (4), however, indicates
that the amount of induced AHH activity in liver,
kidney, bowel, or lung in the B6 mouse is always
slightly greater than that in the (B6D2)F, hetero-
zygote and is always considerably greater than
that in the D2 mouse. Similar results exist in skin
(14,16), lymph nodes (16), bone marrow (17), and
the pigmented epithelium of the retina (18), al-
though differences in inducible AHH activity in
these tissues between B6 and D2 mice are often
not as striking as those in bowel, kidney, and
liver. The fact that the magnitude of AHH and
cytochrome P1-450 induction by polycyclic
aromatic compounds appears to be genetically
regulated in most tissues of the mouse (4,5) is of
importance for the remainder of this report.
Differences in Metabolites Produced by
Different Forms of Cytochrome P-450
Several lines of evidence indicate that at least
two different AHH activities exist (4) and are
associated with different forms of P-450: the
enzyme from MC-treated responsive mice associ-
ated with cytochrome P1-450; and the enzyme
from control or phenobarbital-treated responsive
and nonresponsive mice, or from MC-treated
nonresponsive mice, associated principally with
some form(s) other than P,-450. This finding is
extremely important, because it is now apparent
that different forms of P-450 may generate dif-
ferent ratios of metabolites from the same sub-
strate. Comparing MC versus phenobarbital as
the inducer in rat liver, for example (Fig. 4),
various groups have shown that hydroxylations
may occur predominantly in different chemical
positions on the molecule for such substrates as
biphenyl (19), testosterone (20), 2-acetylamino-
fluorene (21,22), bromobenzene (23), n-hexane
(24), and benzo[a]pyrene (25,26). Such differences
in the metabolite profile of a polycyclic hydrocar-
bon or other foreign chemical reflect presumed
differences in the nature of the intermediates
formed; differences in the reactivity of these in-
termediates might result in marked dissimilari-
ties in the toxicity or carcinogenicity of a given
compound. A good example is the metabolism of

FIGURE 4. Chemical structures of known differences in
metabolite formation (7) when each of these six substrates is
oxygenated in vitro with liver microsomes from rats treated
with MC or phenobarbital (PB). Similar differences in
metabolite profile exist in mice for biphenyl (27), 2-
acetylaminofluorene (28), and benzo[a]pyrene (29), but not
for testosterone (30) or bromobenzene (31). To our
knowledge n-hexane metabolites have not been examined in
MC- and phenobarbital-treated mice.
bromobenzene in rats. The p-phenolic derivative
of bromobenzene, presumably arising from the
3,4-oxide, is associated in some manner with
hepatic necrosis, whereas the o-phenolic
derivative, presumably arising from the 2,3-
oxide, is not (23). This finding is an example (in
rats) in which the higher amounts of cytochrome
P,-450 are beneficial to the animal.
With a similar goal in mind, members of this
laboratory for the past several years have
searched for differences in drug metabolism, tox-
icity, and susceptibility to cancer which can be
shown to be associated with differences in a
single gene (or small number of genes). Although
tumorigenesis initiated by DMBA is not associ-
ated with the Ah locus, for example, subcutane-
ous sarcomas initiated by MC are associated with
inducible AHH activity among 14 inbred strains
of mice (32). With the use of offspring from the F,
to parent backcrosses and the F, x F, intercross,
MC-initiated tumorigenesis was shown recently
(33) to be highly correlated with the Ahb allele.
The remainder of this report deals with two ex-
amples of developmental toxicity which appear to
be associated with the Ahb allele: birth defects
produced by MC and DMBA; and acetaminophen-
produced glutathione depletion and hepatic
necrosis, appearing postnatally.
Differences in Ah Locus Found in Utero
Figure 5 shows that the genetically mediated
AHH induction by MC can be present or relative-
ly absent among different fetuses in the same
uterus. In the experiment illustrated, the enzyme
in seven out of ten (B6D2)F2 fetuses in the same
uterus of a MC-treated (B6D2)F, mother is about
5 to 15 times greater than that found in the pla-
centa, fetal bowel, or fetal liver of the three
nonresponsive individuals or of control F2 mice. If
AHH activity is increased in the placenta the
enzyme is also increased in fetal liver and bowel
of that individual, and vice versa. The fact that
the responsive mother or responsive individuals
in the uterus do not influence AHH induction in
the nonresponsive fetuses or their placentas in
the same uterus indicates that no humoral agent
circulating in the pregnant animal is able to
"derepress" AHH induction in Ahd/Ahd fetuses.
This experiment caused us to wonder whether
certain birth defects could be explained on the
basis of genetic predisposition of a particular
fetus rather than genetic predisposition of the
mother. Such an hypothesis could explain why a
birth defect is found in one child, for example,
when the mother has received the same dose of
the same anticonvulsant during each of six preg-
nancies. We first tested this hypothesis with
polycyclic hydrocarbons in responsive and nonre-
sponsive strains, since these chemicals are known
to be toxic and are known to be metabolized by
one or more forms of cytochrome P-450.

FIGURE 5. Placental, fetal bowel, and fetal liver aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities in (B6D2)F2 fetuses from a MC-treated
(B6D2)F, mother (34). MC was administered intraperitoneally (80 mg/kg) at about 19 days of gestational age, and enzyme
activities on individual fetal mice were determined 24 hr later. A control (B6D2)F1 at about 19 days of gestation received corn
oil alone. Specific hydroxylase activities are expressed as units/mg of tissue homogenate protein for placenta and fetal bowel
and units per mg of microsomal protein for fetal liver.
Association of Ah Responsiveness with
Teratogenesis Produced by MC and DMBA
Table 1 shows that, among the 35 litters in con-
trol mice, no malformations are observed and be-
tween 6.9 and 12.5% stillborns and resorptions
are seen among the four inbred strains. These
values are in line with other studies (36,37) using
similar inbred mouse strains; for example, 0.05%
of 1947 C57BL/lOGn newborns was polydacty-
lous (37). The combination of stillborns, resorp-
tions, and malformations can be seen to be
generally greater among MC- or DMBA-treated
responsive B6, C3H/HeN, and BALB/cAnN, com-
pared with that in MC- or DMBA-treated non-
responsive AKR/N (AKR). We repeatedly at-
tempted to breed DBA/2N, 129/J, and AU/SsJ-
three other nonresponsive inbred strains-but
the rates of pregnancy were too low to be in-
cluded in these teratology studies. Except for one
malformation (pigmented lesion on forehead) in
DMBA-treated AKR, all malformations-a total
of 21-are found among 51 litters of polycyclic
hydrocarbon-treated B6 mice.
Table 2 summarizes all the data, regardless of
the dose of MC or DMBA, for the day of gestation
on which the chemical was administered. We real-
ize that the number of letters of responsive ver-
sus nonresponsive strains is not the same at each
dose of MC or DMBA given (Table 1); in spite of
this, comparing all responsive with nonrespon-
sive mice receiving MC or DMBA (Table 2) pro-
vides us with valuable information. The incidence
of malformations in responsive mice, compared
with that in nonresponsive mice, is striking: 6.5%
to 0% for MC; 4.6% to 0.4% for DMBA. The com-
bined stillborns, resorptions, and malformations
are 2- to 3-fold greater in responsive than in
nonresponsive mice for both MC and DMBA: 47%
to 18% for MC; 28% to 11.5% for DMBA. If the
background defects (in control animals) are sub-
tracted from the experimental data, the com-
bined stillborns, resorptions, and malformations
are 5- and about 20-fold greater for MC- and
DMBA-treated responsive mice, respectively,
compared with corresponding nonresponsive
mice: 39% to 7.6% for MC; 20% to 1.1% for
DMBA.

With the results so far, however, we are com-
paring inbred strains only. A similar study, for
example, showed a significantly greater inci-
dence of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin-
induced kidney anomalies in C57BL/6J fetuses
than in DBA/2J fetuses (38). Experiments using
MC- and DMBA-treated pregnant mice with
(B6D2)D2 or (B6AKR)AKR individuals in utero
are currently being performed. Only after malfor-
mations are shown to be associated with the re-
sponsive phenotype can we conclude that the Ahb
allele, rather than merely a difference between
inbred strains, is associated with polycyclic
hydrocarbon-induced teratogenesis. Other hy-
drophobic chemicals and drugs-known or sus-
pected to interact with one or more forms of
P-450-are also being tested in this model
system.
Acetaminophen Metabolism
Various other monooxygenase "activities" are
associated with AHH induction by polycyclic hy-
drocarbons and therefore the Ahb allele and cyto-
chrome(s) P1 -450: p-nitroanisole O-demethylase,
7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase, 3-methyl-4-
methylaminoazobenzene N-demethylase, zoxazol-
amine 6-hydroxylase, 2-acetylaminofluorene
N-hydroxylase, phenacetin O-deethylase,
naphthalene monooxygenase, acetanilide 4-
hydroxylase, biphenyl 4-hydroxylase, and bi-
phenyl 2-hydroxylase (4). It now appears that the
N-hydroxylation of acetaminophen (Fig. 6), like
that of 2-acetylaminofluorene, is predominantly
mediated by PA-450; the N-hydroxylation of
several other N-acetylarylamines also appears to
be catalyzed by PA-450 (40). The rearrangement
of the N-hydroxy derivative to a highly reactive
electrophile has been postulated (39) to be the
principal mechanism by which glutathione or co-
valently bound protein or nucleic acid occurs
ortho to the hydroxyl group. The amount of radio-
active metabolite covalently bound to acid-precip-
itable material, following administration of large
doses of [3H]acetaminophen, is associated in the
hamster and mouse with gluthathione depletion
and the magnitude of hepatic necrosis observed
(39). It recently has been found (28,40) that the
Ahb allele is highly correlated with
acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and in-
creases in covalently bound metabolites of the
drug.

always between 2% and 6% of the total content
in this figure and in subsequent figures (41). Total
glutathione content in fetal liver is quite small
when compared with that in adult liver, increases
at birth to about 33% of adult levels, and reaches
adult levels at about 10 days postpartum. Similar
developmental curves-such as this for glutathi-
one content and Fig. 3 for basal and inducible
AHH activity-are common for numerous en-
zymes, e.g., y-glutamyltransferase (43), tyrosine
aminotransferase (44), glucose-6-phosphate de-
hydrogenase (45), uridine kinase (46), lysyl hy-
droxylase (47), and pyruvate decarboxylase (48).
It can be seen in Figure 6 that an increase in
N-hydroxylation enhances the need for reduced
glutathione. It is known (39) that glutathione
depletion precedes marked increases in covalent-
ly bound acetaminophen. Figure 8A shows
glutathione depletion in maternal liver following
acetaminophen administration. Glutathione con-
tent decreases to about 15% of normal 2 hr after
a 250 mg/kg dose but returns to 63% and 120% of
normal 3 hr and 5 hr, respectively, after the drug
was given. Twenty-four hours later the glutathi-
one content is 165% of normal; the mechanism for
this overcompensation is not understood. Both
500 and 1000 mg/kg of acetaminophen depletes
glutathione content to less than 10% of normal
within 2 hr, and there is no recovery during the
next 3 hr. In most instances these pregnant mice
die within 12 hr, the cause of death presumably
related to the irreparable hepatic necrosis at
these large doses of acetaminophen. In contrast
to the results in maternal liver, no significant
glutathione depletion in fetal liver occurs after
the 250 mg/kg dose of acetaminophen (Fig. 8B),
and there is only about 50% depletion 5 hr after
the 1000 mg/kg dose.
The reasons for this striking "protection" of
the fetoplacental unit against the toxic effects of
acetaminophen are not known. Acrylamide, at
doses which produce neuropathy in pregnant
rats, fails to cause adverse effects in fetuses near
term; this protection of the fetoplacental unit was
shown not to be due to failure of acrylamide to
cross the placenta (49). Likewise, acetaminophen
crosses the placenta readily (Fig. 9).
Figure 10 illustrates that liver glutathione in
mice 10 days of age or less in relatively resistant
to depletion by acetaminophen. By 15 days of age,
however, the glutathione depletion is as great as
that seen in the adult. There may be a greater
rate of sulfate or glucuronide conjugation, rela-
tive to the PA-450 N-hydroxylation pathway (see

[3H]acetaminophen (final specific radioactivity of 0.9
jACi/jlmole) was given, and the parent drug that remained at
various time intervals was determined according to the
method of Mitchell et al. (50). Three mothers, two litter-
mates and two placentas from each mother were used in this
experiment.

Covalent Binding of Acetaminophen Associated
with the Ahb Allele
Figure 11 shows that MC treatment enhances
glutathione depletion by acetaminophen in both
maternal and fetal liver of genetically responsive
mice. Such an enhancement is not seen in preg-
nant nonresponsive AKR/N mice. These data
suggest that the N-hydroxylation of acet-
aminophen is associated with P1-450 induction
and therefore the AhI allele. This suggestion was
recently confirmed (40); using MC-treated prog-
eny from the appropriate backcrosses and inter-
cross of the B6 and D2 strains, Wirth and co-
workers demonstrated a highly statistically sig-

Pathological Conditions Associated with
Ahb Allele or Aromatic Hydrocarbon
Responsiveness
Table 3 summarizes the various effects caused
by differences in xenobiotic metabolism due to
the Ah locus, which have been reported by this
laboratory as well as by Kouri, Hutton, et al.
DMBA-produced skin inflammation, MC-or
DMBA-caused birth defects, benzo[a]pyrene-
initiated tumors, and acetaminophen-caused cat-
aracts all have been studied to date only as
differences among inbred strains. All other
effects listed in Table 3 have been demonstrated
to be correlated specifically with the Ahb allele by
means of studies using siblings from the (B6D2)F,
x D2 backcross. In vitro effects that have been
shown to be correlated with the Ahb allele include
MC, 6-aminochrysene, and 2-acetylaminofluorene
mutagenesis (55) and differences in the profile of
benzo[a]pyrene metabolites binding to DNA
nucleosides (7).
