Summary
We examined the genetic status of human leucocyte
antigens (HLA), human platelet alloantigens (HPA) and
neutrophil-speciﬁc antigens (NA) in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus and diabetic arteriosclerosis obliterans
(ASO). To our knowledge, the present study is the ﬁrst
report showing the relationship among three genetic
factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus and ASO patients. HLA
typing was performed by the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR)–restriction fragment length polymorphism method.
HPA-typing and NA-typing were by a PCR-sequence-speciﬁc
primer method. The incidence of HLA-DRB1*1501 was
found to be signiﬁcant in type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic,
particularly ASO-positive patients, compared to control
subjects. There were no differences in NA1/NA2 between
the control and diabetic or non-diabetic ASO groups.
However, the frequency of NA2/NA2 in ASO-positive
diabetes and non-diabetic ASO patients was signiﬁcantly
higher than controls. The a/b genotype of HPA-5a/5b was
signiﬁcantly lower in type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic
ASO-positive patients than in controls. These ﬁndings
suggest that genetic studies of HLA, NA and HPA could
be useful to understand the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes
and ASO.
Introduction
The underlying pathology of atherosclerosis obliterans
(ASO) is basically atherosclerosis, and complete occlu-
sions by fresh or old thrombi are often observed
(Schwartz et al., 1995; Williams & Tabas, 1995). Recent
evidence indicates that the incidence of thrombotic
disease is steadily increasing among Asian populations
(Kauffmann-Zeh et al., 2000). Epidemiological studies
indicate that thrombotic diseases result from complex
interactions between susceptibility factors, chronic en-
vironmental inﬂuences and established intercurrent dis-
orders such as diabetes mellitus (Kunicki, 2002). The critical
role of platelets in the thrombotic process is now well
accepted (Rauch et al., 2001). At sites of vascular injury,
thrombus formation is initiated by binding platelet glyco-
protein (GP) Ib to von Willebrand factor and binding
platelet GPIa/IIa to collagen, which leads to platelet acti-
vation and aggregation by binding platelet GPIIb/IIIa to
ﬁbrinogen and von Willebrand factor (Kunicki, 2000).
Several polymorphisms in the genes encoding for platelet
GPs have been associated with increased platelet ad-
hesiveness and aggregation, and in some studies, they have
been associated with an increased risk of arterial throm-
bosis (Bray, 1999; Bussel et al., 2000; Reiner et al., 2000).
Human platelet alloantigens (HPA) are important for
sensitization to platelet GP polymorphisms. In general,
HPAs play important roles in the pathogenesis of neonatal
alloimmune thrombocytopenia and post-transfusion pur-
pura, as well as in some cases of refractoriness to platelet
transfusion (Von dem Borne Kr. et al., 1981; Von dem
Borne Kr. & Ouwehand, 1989; McFarland et al., 1991;
Dreyfus et al., 1997). However, there are few reports
available concerning the relationship between type 2 dia-
betes and diabetic ASO.
Leucocytes have been suggested to play an important
role in the development of atherosclerosis (Beekhuizen &
van Furth, 1993; Jonasson et al., 1986). The ﬁrst step in the
process of leucocyte inﬁltration into the sub-endothelial
space is adhesion of circulating cells to the endothelium
(Jonasson et al., 1986). Thus, the pathogenesis of athero-
sclerosis appears to be inﬂammation (Ross, 1993). A recent
study suggests genetic predisposition and chronic inﬂam-
mation play the leading roles in the early stages and in the
development of vascular damage (Diamantopoulos et al.,
2002; Tsuchiya et al., 2003). In addition, the Fcγreceptor
polymorphism is related to susceptibility of some immu-
nological diseases (Dijstelbloem et al., 2000; Nieto et al.,
2000; Fujimoto et al., 2001), and neutrophil-speciﬁc anti-
gens (NA)1 and NA2 are located on the Fcγreceptor IIIb
(Matsuo et al., 2000). On the other hand, studies have
long suggested associations between certain human leuco-
cyte antigens (HLA) and many autoimmune diseases.

With respect to the genetic aspects of thrombotic diseases
such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, the HLA haplotype of
patients can possibly be considered a potentially important
factor in the aetiology, although its role remains unclear.
This study examined the genetic status of HLA, HPA
and NA in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and dia-
betic ASO. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report detail-
ing relationships among these three genetic factors in type
2 diabetes mellitus and ASO patients.
Materials and methods
Subjects
We studied 104 Japanese patients (67 men and 37 women,
aged 39–85 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as
deﬁned by the American Diabetes Association Criteria
(The Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classiﬁca-
tion of Diabetes Mellitus, 1997). Seventeen non-diabetic
ASO patients were used for patient control subjects.
A brief clinical proﬁle of the 104 diabetic patients and
17 non-diabetic ASO patients is presented in Table 1.
One hundred and twenty-nine controls were randomly
selected from among healthy unrelated Japanese individ-
uals. Approval was obtained from the Institutional
Review Board for these studies, and informed consent was
obtained in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Diagnosis of ASO
All patients were evaluated by the ankle-pressure index
(API). Patients with an API > 1.0 were considered not to
have ASO. Thirty-three patients with API < 1.0 under-
went angiography and plethysmography, and 28 were
diagnosed as having ASO (Fontain’s class I–III). Of these,
21 patients with ASO underwent bypass procedures for
femoral and trifurcation occlusive disease. Seventeen non-
diabetic ASO patients were also diagnosed with Fontain’s
class I–III. Of these, 10 patients with ASO underwent
bypass procedures.
HLA DNA typing by PCR–RFLP
Genomic DNAs from 104 diabetic patients, 17 non-
diabetic patients and 126 healthy control subjects were
isolated by phenol extraction of sodium dodecyl sulphate-
lysed and proteinase K-treated cells. DNA was ampliﬁed
by PCR with Taq DNA polymerase, and HLA typing was
performed by the PCR–restriction fragment length poly-
morphism (RFLP) method (Ota et al., 1992). The reaction
mixture was subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation at
96–97 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55–62 °C for 1 min,
and extension at 72 °C for 2 min in an automated PCR
thermal sequencer (Iwaki Glass, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). After
ampliﬁcation, aliquots of the products were digested with
allele-speciﬁc restriction endonucleases for 3 h after
addition of the appropriate reaction buffer. Samples
of the ampliﬁed and cleaved DNAs were subjected
to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gel in a
minigel apparatus (Mupid-2, Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd, Tokyo,
Japan). Cleavage of ampliﬁed fragments was detected
by staining with ethidium bromide, and genotypes were
determined on the basis of the RFLP band patterns thus
generated.
NA genotyping by PCR–preferential homoduplex
formation assay (PHFA)
We applied PCR–preferential homoduplex formation
assay (PHFA) developed by Oka et al. (1994) to DNA
typing of neutrophil-speciﬁc antigens (NA1, NA2 and
SH) located on the neutrophil receptor, FcγRIIIb. Gene
fragments containing the polymorphic sequences corre-
sponding to NA1, NA2 and SH of FcγRIIIb, as well as the
homologous fragment of FcγRIIIa, were ampliﬁed by
PCR using speciﬁc primers (Fujiwara et al., 1996, 1999).
Assay procedure was performed according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions (Wakunaga Pharm. Co., Ltd, Hiro-
shima, Japan).
HPA DNA typing by enzyme-linked mini-sequence
assay (ELMA)
Gene fragments that contained polymorphic sequences
corresponding to HPA-1, HPA-2, HPA-3, HPA-4, HPA-5
and HPA-6 were speciﬁcally ampliﬁed by the PCR
method. Enzyme-linked mini-sequence assay (ELMA)
typing was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Smitest HPA Genotype ELMA, Sumitomo
Metal Industries, Ltd, Ibaraki, Japan).
Statistical analysis
The χ2
method with continuity correction and Fisher’s
exact test were used for HLA data analysis. Relative risk
was calculated according to Wolf’s method with Hold-
ane’s correction. Brieﬂy, it was calculated as (a × d)/(b × c),
where a, b, c and d are the number of marker-positive
patients, marker-negative patients, marker-positive con-
trols and marker-negative controls, respectively (Thom-
son, 1981). The frequencies of the FcγRIIIb and HPA
alleles were estimated by a gene-counting method and
tested for deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg equilib-
rium using the χ2
test.

Results
Table 2 shows the HLA-DRB1 alleles in the control and type
2 diabetes patients. The incidence of HLA-DRB1*1501
was found to be signiﬁcant in type 2 diabetes and non-
diabetic ASO-positive patients compared to controls (con-
trol vs. ASO-negative diabetic patients, 11.6% vs. 35.5%,
P < 0.05; control vs. ASO-positive diabetic patients, 11.6%
vs. 60.7%, P < 0.01; control vs. non-diabetic ASO-positive
patients, 11.6% vs. 52.9%, P < 0.05). In addition, the
incidence of this allele was found to be signiﬁcant in ASO
patients compared to non-ASO patients, although there
was no signiﬁcant difference between diabetic and non-
diabetic patients (Fig. 1). On the other hand, another
DRB1 allele did not exhibit signiﬁcant differences.
Table 3 shows NA gene frequency in control and type
2 diabetes patients; there were no differences in NA1/
NA2 among the control, type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic
ASO groups. However, the frequency of NA2/NA2 in
ASO-positive diabetic and non-diabetic ASO patients was
signiﬁcantly higher than in controls (control vs. ASO-
negative diabetic patients, 12.4% vs. 23.7%, N.S.; control
vs. ASO-positive diabetic patients, 12.4% vs. 39.3%,
P < 0.05; control vs. non-diabetic ASO-positive patients,
12.4% vs. 41.2%, P < 0.05).
Table 4 shows the HPA genotypes of the control and
diabetic patients. The a/b genotype of HPA-5a/5b was
signiﬁcantly lower in type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic
ASO patients than in controls (Control vs. ASO-negative
diabetic patients, 7.0% vs. 1.3%, N.S.; control vs. ASO-
positive diabetic patients, 7.0% vs. 0%, P < 0.05; control
vs. non-diabetic ASO-positive patients, 7.0% vs. 0%,
P < 0.05).
Discussion
Polymorphisms of class II genes within the major histo-
compatibility complex can now be precisely determined
by typing using the PCR–RFLP method. For example,
serologically deﬁned HLA-DR antigens can be divided
into many alleles reﬂecting the polymorphism of the
amino acid sequence in the allelic hypervariable regions of
the β chain. In addition, it has been reported that aplastic
anemia patients with HLA-DR2 are likely to respond to
immunosuppressive therapy (Nimer et al., 1994; Nakao
et al., 1994). We have reported that the frequency of
HLA-DR decreased and that of DRB1*0410 signiﬁcantly
increased in immune thrombocytopenic purpura patients
with poor response to prednisolone (Nomura et al.,

1998). Thus, the analysis of HLA antigens and alleles
appears to offer some guidelines for the treatment of
autoimmune diseases. In the present study, HLA
DRB1*1501 was found to be more common in diabetic,
particularly ASO-positive, patients. In addition, this allele
was also found to be more common in non-diabetic ASO-
positive patients. Thus, the association between patients
and DRB1*1501 is not always related to type 2 diabetes,
because this association is detected in non-diabetic
patients. Type 1 diabetes was reported to be associated
with some HLA alleles (Park, 2004). However, for the
type 2 allele, such relationship was not detected. On the
other hand, the association between HLA and infection is
possible to detect. In the recent study, Veneri et al. (2005)
reported the relationship between Helicobacter pylori and
HLA in immune thrombocytopenic purpura patients. Our
ﬁndings suggest the hypothesis that HLA regulates immu-
noreactive inﬂammation or infection associated with type
2 diabetes or ASO. Thus, analysis of some HLA alleles
may provide the information for predicting ASO or type
2 diabetes, if racial differences are taken into account.
Diamantopoulos et al. (2002) evaluated 197 patients with
type 2 diabetes, and found a signiﬁcant association
between HLA-A3 and carotid intimal media thickness.
In the Japanese population, the frequency of HLA-A3 is
extremely low. In addition, most DRB1*1501 are associ-
ated with HLA-A2, -A24 or -A26. The discrepancy
between our results and Diamontopoulos’s is thought to
depend on racial differences. However, most autoimmune
diseases share pathogenetic mechanisms characterized by
association with an HLA class II haplotype. Also, the
pathogenesis of diabetic or non-diabetic ASO may be
heterogeneous; therefore, analysis of a larger population
with diverse genetic backgrounds will be needed.
FcγRIIIb is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
protein expressed on neutrophils (Ravetch & Perussia,
1989). NA1 and NA2 located on the neutrophil receptor
FcγRIIIb are known to be involved in disorders such as
neonatal alloimmune neutropenia, autoimmune neutro-
penia and transfusion-related acute lung injury (Lalezari
et al., 1960, 1975; Yomtovian et al., 1984). In addition,
polymorphisms inﬂuencing the binding afﬁnity between
the FcγRs and IgG of different subclasses are recently
thought to be important for individual susceptibility to
infection with gram-negative bacteria contributing to per-
iodontal disease (Meisel et al., 2001). Indeed, Kobayashi
et al. (2000) reported the importance of the FcγRIIIb-
NA2 allele for susceptibility to IgG in Japanese periodon-
titis patients. In the present study, the frequency of NA2/
NA2 was found to be signiﬁcantly higher in ASO-positive
type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic ASO patients than in
controls. Our results suggest the importance of the NA2
allele in susceptibility to ASO. Apart from some reports of
periodontal disease, Fijen et al. (2000) reported that the
FcγRIIIb-NA2/NA2 allotype appeared associated with
meningococcal disease. However, previous reports have
not always noted the importance of the NA2 allele. For
example, Raknes et al. (1998) reported that myasthenia
gravis patients with the NA1/NA1 genotype had the most
severe condition. The function of FcγRIIIb is not entirely
clear; however, interestingly, FcγRIIIb induces actin ﬁla-
ment assembly that is a prerequisite for phagocytosis,
while cross-linking of the FcγRIIIb by immune complexes
enhances FcγRII mediated phagocytosis (Salmon et al.,
1991; Flesch et al., 1998). These functions may be related
to the development of atherosclerosis, since the pathogen-
esis of atherosclerosis includes inﬂammation. In addition,
our results possibly reﬂect on such a hypothesis.
HPA plays an important role in provoking neonatal
alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, post-transfusion
purpura and refractoriness to platelet transfusion. To
date, 10 HPA systems have been described and several
additional alloantigen systems have been reported (Bussel
et al., 2000; Kunicki, 2000, 2002). In particular, HPA-1
(PlA.
), HPA-2 (Ko), HPA-3 (Bak), HPA-4 (Pen) and HPA-
5 (Br) have been well established by serological analysis
(Kunicki & Newman, 1992). The HPA-1a (PlA1
, Zwa
)
antigen is by far the most common antigen implicated in
neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in a Caucasian
population (Taaning et al., 1983; McFarland et al., 1989;
Mueller-Eckhardt et al., 1989). On the other hand, HPA-
4b is responsible for neonatal alloimmune thrombocyto-
penia in Japanese. This discrepancy in ﬁndings would
have occurred because the HPA phenotype frequency
varies between races. HPA systems also reside on functional
platelet receptor proteins. It has been shown by a number
of groups that all platelet-speciﬁc alloantigens thus far dis-
covered are located on four platelet membrane GPs:
GPIIb, GPIIIa, GPIb and GPIa. Thus, it has been reported
that polymorphism of HPA is a genetic risk factor for
thrombotic diseases (Weiss et al., 1996; Gonzalez-
Conejero et al., 1998; Sperr et al., 1998; Carter et al., 1999;
Kroll et al., 2000; Baker et al., 2001; Mikkelsson et al.,

2001, 2002; Jilma-Stohlawetz et al., 2003). In the present
study, the a/b genotype of HPA-5a/5b was signiﬁcantly
lower in type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic ASO patients
than in controls. The Lys505Glu amino acid substitution
located in the cation-binding domain of α2 is responsible
for HPA-5b (Bra
) and HPA-5a (Brb
) epitope formation
(Santoso et al., 1993). In a large study, Kroll et al. (2000)
found an association between HPA-5 dimorphism in a
low-risk patient subgroup with coronary artery disease. In
this population, the frequency of Brb
homozygous individ-
uals was overrepresented. This ﬁnding suggests that the
allele 3 (807C; Bra
) may increase the risk for thrombotic
disease through a quantitative effect on the function that
is independent of the genetic effects on expression levels.
However, the frequency of phenotype HPA-5b in Japa-
nese is lower than that in Caucasian (8.7 vs. 20.6%). In
addition, it has been reported that the probability of HPA-
related immunization is strongly associated with HLA
class II DR types (Gonzalez-Conejero et al., 1998). A
larger number of patients will need to be examined to
conﬁrm this possibility.
In conclusion, we performed a genetic analysis of HLA,
NA and HPA in Japanese control subjects and type 2 dia-
betes patients with and without ASO. The incidence of
HLA-DRB1*1501 was found to be signiﬁcant in type 2
diabetes and non-diabetic ASO-positive patients com-
pared with controls, and the frequency of this allele was
signiﬁcant in patients with ASO. The frequency of NA2/
NA2 in ASO-positive diabetes and non-diabetic ASO-
positive patients was signiﬁcantly higher than in controls.
The a/b genotype of HPA-5a/5b was signiﬁcantly lower in
type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic ASO-positive patients
than in controls. These ﬁndings suggest that genetic studies
of HLA, NA and HPA could be useful to understand
the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and ASO.
