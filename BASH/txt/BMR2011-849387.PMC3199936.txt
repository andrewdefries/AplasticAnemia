Congenital bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFSs) are relatively rare disorders characterized by aberrant development in one
or more hematopoietic lineages. Genetic alterations have now been identiﬁed in most of these disorders although the exact role
of the molecular defects has yet to be elucidated. Most of these diseases are successfully managed with supportive care, however,
treatment refractoriness and disease progression—often involving malignant transformation—may necessitate curative treatment
with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Due to the underlying molecular defects, the outcome of transplantation for BMFS
may be dramatically diﬀerent than those associated with transplantation for more common diseases, including leukemia. Given
recent improvements in survival and molecular diagnosis of bone marrow failure syndrome patients presenting at adult ages
without physical stigmata, it is important for both pediatric and adult hematologists to be aware of the possible diagnosis of BMF
syndromes and the unique approaches required in treating such patients.
1. Introduction
Bone marrow failure syndromes (BMFSs) are a constellation
of disorders characterized by abnormal hematopoiesis and
often accompanied by assorted physical ﬁndings and a strik-
ingly increased risk for hematologic malignancy. Historically,
patients presented with signiﬁcant cytopenias and physical
stigmata during childhood. However, it is now evident that
BMFS posses a broad range of phenotype penetrance and
an increasing number of patients are being identiﬁed in
adulthood, occasionally presenting with leukemia or aplastic
anemia. Some BMFS disorders are associated with defective
DNA repair or maintenance pathways and possess increased
sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents including chemother-
apy and radiation. These sensitivities have been clearly
demonstrated by the signiﬁcantly increased chemotherapy-
related and stem cell transplant-related morbidity and
mortality in BMFS patients. It is therefore important for
both pediatric and adult hematologists to be aware of the
presentation, management, complications, and approaches
to treat BMFS. We review here transplantation approaches
and outcomes in patients with Fanconi Anemia, Diamond-
Blackfan anemia, dyskeratosis congenita, severe congeni-
tal neutropenia, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome to
illustrate their relative risks for malignancy and reported
utility of varying transplant regimens. The reporting of
cumulative transplant outcomes will hopefully add clarity to
the indications for transplantation in these disorders.
2. Fanconi Anemia
Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a disease of abnormal DNA repair
resulting in abnormal hematopoiesis, variable anatomic
phenotypes, and an increased predisposition to malignancy.
13 FANC genes have been identiﬁed that are responsible
for forming an ubiquitinating nuclear core complex, acting
as a chromatin binding cofactor for other DNA repair
enzymes, or exerting DNA helicase activity all in response to
DNA intrastrand cross-linking damage. The gene FANCD1
was previously identiﬁed as BRCA2, the breast cancer
susceptibility gene 2.
2 Bone Marrow Research
Physical ﬁndings may include short stature and skeletal
abnormalities (classically involving radius or thumb), devel-
opmental delay, abnormal kidneys, skin pigmentation/caf´e
au lait spots, and triangular facies in 60%–75% of patients.
Hematologic cytopenias are almost always present at diagno-
sis and may include uni-, bi-, or trilineage involvement. The
risk of early bone marrow failure appears to correlate with
the presence of certain physical abnormalities and high-risk
patients face a 7% annual incidence of bone marrow failure
[1]. Conversely, patients without physical ﬁndings or subtle
physical abnormalities are at less risk for early bone marrow
failure and may thus present in adulthood. Ten percent of
FA patients may present at greater than 16 years of age [1].
Fanconi Anemia patients are at increased risk of developing
malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), head/neck cancers, and
gynecologic malignancies; the relative risk of developing
speciﬁc solid tumors and AML/MDS ranges from several
hundred- to several thousand-fold compared to the general
population [2, 3].
Given the high risk of bone marrow failure and
clonal abnormalities, FA patients are often considered for
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Initial transplan-
tation attempts with antigen-matched donors resulted in
80% mortality at 3 years when conditioned with cyclophos-
phamide 200 mg/kg and 500 cGy thoraco-abdominal irra-
diation (TAI) [4]. In vitro studies of FA primary cells
demonstrated increased sensitivity to cyclophosphamide
[5] and irradiation [6]. Subsequent transplants have thus
used reduced intensity conditioning regimens and achieved
increased survival and decreased graft versus host disease
(GVHD) severity. At present, transplant from a sibling-
matched donor remains the optimum therapy for FA. A
recent series of 30 patients without demonstrable clonality or
malignancy receiving sibling-matched donor bone marrows
used a conditioning regimen of ATG, cyclophosphamide
20 mg/kg (40 mg/kg for one 5/6 sibling match), 400 cGy TAI
(450 cGy for lone 5/6 sibling match), and GVHD prophylaxis
of cyclosporine and steroids. The authors reported a 97%
neutrophil engraftment rate and 77% ﬁve-year overall sur-
vival with an incidence of 20% acute GVHD (aGVHD) and
7% chronic GVHD (cGVHD) [7].
In contrast, Wagner et al. reported 98 FA patients (78
HLA identical matches) who underwent an unrelated bone
marrow transplantation and were conditioned with TBI
(450 cGy), cyclophosphamide (20–40 mg/kg), and ATG ±
ﬂudarabine. The addition of ﬂudarabine (used in post-1998
transplants) with T-cell depletion signiﬁcantly enhanced
neutrophil engraftment rates (89%), decreased aGVHD
Grade II–IV probability (16%), and increased adjusted 100-
day survival (76% versus 35%) and 3-year survival (52%
versus 13%) compared to nonﬂudarabine regimens. Overall
mortality within the ﬂudarabine-conditioned patients was
secondary to graft failure (15%), GVHD (11%), and organ
failure (11%) [8]. Gluckman et al. reported the outcome of
93 unrelated umbilical cord stem cell transplant recipients
with half of patients receiving a 6/6 or 5/6 matched cord,
the other half receiving 2- or 3-HLA mismatched cords.
Sixty one percent of patients received ﬂudarabine-based
regimens, 80% received TBI, and 81% received anti-T cell
therapy. Median average cell count was 1.9 × 105
CD34+
cells/kg and 4.9 × 107
TNC/kg. Neutrophil engraftment at
the relatively late time-point of 60 days was achieved by 60%
(median time to neutrophil recovery for these patients was
23 days), incidence of acute GVHD Grade II–IV 32% (no
aGVHD observed in matched cords), and a 3-year overall
survival of 40% (50% in patients receiving ﬂudarabine-
based conditioning) [9]. Patients receiving 6/6, 5/6, and 3-
4/6 matched cords had 3-year OS of 74%, 48%, and 25%
respectively. Of the 56 deaths, mortality was largely due to
infection (31%), graft failure (21%), and aGVHD (12.5%).
Acknowledging the increased risks irradiation may pose
for FA patients, an international retrospective study of 148
sibling-matched patients receiving irradiation, cyclophos-
phamide ± ATG versus cyclophosphamide alone or in com-
bination with ATG, ﬂudarabine, or busulfan reported similar
neutrophil engraftment rates by day 28 (94% versus 89%,
resp.) and day 100 (92% each), similar incidence of Grade
II–IV acute GVHD (23% versus 21%, resp.), and similar
adjusted probability of 5-year survival (78% versus 81%,
resp.) with similar mortality from infection, GVHD, and
organ failure [10]. Consistent with these ﬁndings, Locatelli et
al. analyzed the utility of cyclophosphamide and ﬂudarabine
conditioning in 31 sibling-matched HSCT patients with a
reported estimated 8-year OS of 87% [11]. A radiation dose
reduction study at the University of Minnesota reported
100% engraftment with 300 cGy TBI in 22 FA patients
receiving MUD transplants (although both patients receiving
150 cGy experienced secondary graft failure) [12].
Transplantation remains the front-line therapy for bone
marrow failure in FA patients. Sibling-matched donors have
traditionally been the donor although MUD BMT and
UCSCT outcomes have improved with the incorporation
of ﬂudarabine into the conditioning regimen. Current data
support the feasibility of reducing radiation dosages from
the standard conditioning regimens in MUD transplants,
and perhaps elimination of radiation in sibling-matched
transplants.
3. Diamond Blackfan Anemia
Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a congenital disorder
consisting of red cell aplasia and assorted physical abnor-
malities including short stature, craniofacial abnormalities,
and radial irregularities. Consistent with other congenital
BMF syndromes, DBA patients have an increased risk of
developing malignancies. A longitudinal followup of 72 DBA
patients reported 4 cases of AML ranging 15–30 years after
the diagnosis of DBA [13]. Osteogenic sarcoma has also
been reported in DBA patients [14]. Over 50% of DBA
patients possess a mutation in a ribosomal protein, although
the exact pathophysiology of the disease remains unclear.
Patients typically present in infancy with a macrocytic
anemia [15]; erythrocytes have disrupted maturation and
possess elevated adenosine deaminase levels [16]. There is a
spectrum of anemia severity and red blood cell transfusion
requirements. Steroids are the front-line medical therapy
Bone Marrow Research 3
and approximately 70%–80% of DBA patients will initially
have a transfusion free response [17, 18]. Only 20% retain
a sustained remissions oﬀ of steroids and thus steroid-
related complications and transfusion-induced iron overload
remain signiﬁcant problems.
Case reports of HSCT in DBA date back to 1976
[19] but large studies are limited. A retrospective review
analyzed transplants from 8 sibling matched versus 12
MUD donors in 20 patients, resulting in a 5-year overall
survival of 87.5% and 28%, respectively [20] (excluding one
death from osteogenic sarcoma in the MUD arm). These
results are confounded by diﬀerences in radiation containing
conditioning regimens. Roy et al. [21] reported IBMTR
registry outcomes of 61 transplanted DBA patients (median
age 7 years), with two-thirds receiving transplants from
matched sibling donors and 20% from MUD (remainder
received nonsibling family donor). 95% of sibling-matched
recipients received myeloablative, cyclophosphamide-based
conditioning, and 45% of MUD recipients received TBI-
based conditioning. All patients received bone marrow
stem cells. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine,
methotrexate, or both in 90% of the patients. Ninety-two
percent and 75% of all patients demonstrated neutrophil
and platelet engraftment by Day 100, respectively with no
diﬀerence between the two arms (although Day 28 engraft-
ment rates were signiﬁcantly higher in the sibling-matched
arm). Total nonengraftment incidence was 9%. Cumulative
incidence of acute GVHD grade II–IV was 28% and cGVHD
was 19% with overall incidence being too small to detect
diﬀerences between the two donor types. Heavily transfused
patients (receiving greater than 50 transfusions) had slower
engraftment rates (at Day 28 for neutrophil recover and Day
60 platelet recovery) although this did not impact total Day
100 engraftment percentages. Overall survival at 1 and 3
years was signiﬁcantly superior with HLA-identical sibling
donors versus matched, unrelated donors (78% versus 45%,
and 76% versus 39%, resp.). Of the 23 deaths, the most
prevalent causes of mortality were infection (31%), graft
failure (27%), and interstitial pneumonia (13%). Only one
patient died due to GVHD. The use of irradiation, the
number of transfusions, time duration between diagnosis
and transplant, and age at transplant were not associated
with diﬀerences in survival. Data regarding iron overload
status at time of transplant were not available.
The poor outcomes of MUD transplantation are likely
due to the relatively high number of antigen-based matches
involved in these reports. In the relatively more HLA-
homogenous Japanese population, nineteen Japanese DBA
patients [18] receiving transplants from varying sources
(42% sibling matched, 32% matched unrelated, 21% mis-
matched unrelated, 5% mismatched related) and condi-
tioned with cyclophosphamide plus irradiation in 68% and
without irradiation in 32% had (excluding one early death)
100 day neutrophils engraftment rates of 90%, with both
nonengrafting patients receiving unrelated, 4/6 cord blood
transplants. GVHD prophylaxis was largely cyclosporine-
based; incidence of acute GVHD grades II–IV was 25%
and only one case of chronic GVHD was reported. Overall
survival at 5 years was 79%; 5-year failure-free survival was
100% in recipients of bone marrow transplants compared to
40% of cord-blood recipients. Observable outcome diﬀer-
ences between HLA-identical sibling BMT and MUD BMT
were limited to recovery time of platelets although overall
engraftment rates were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Addition-
ally, recent mention of the DBA Registry data reports early
overall survival rate of 85% in MUD transplants performed
since 2000, far superior to more dated publications [22].
Historically, upfront transplantation for DBA was largely
restricted to transfusion-requiring patients with available
sibling-matched donors. It is now evident that MUD trans-
plantation is an increasingly feasible option although more
data and experience are required before identifying its exact
role for DBA. Limiting transfusion exposures, controlling
iron overload, minimizing steroid-induced adverse eﬀects,
and monitoring for malignancy continue to be of crucial
importance in the care of these patients.
4. Dyskeratosis Congenita
Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a failure in telomere main-
tenance resulting in the classic triad of abnormal skin
pigmentation, nail dystrophy, and leukoplakia of the oral
mucosa as well as lacrimal duct stenosis, pulmonary ﬁbrosis,
and bone marrow failure. Mutations in the telomere main-
tenance complexes (including DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10,
NHP2, TINF2) result in shortened telomeres especially in
stem cells undergoing high proliferative rates. Abrogation of
hematopoietic stem cell replicative potential results in bone
marrow failure in 85% of patients and is the cause of death in
80% [23]. Similar to Fanconi Anemia patients, DC patients
are at increased risk for hematologic and solid malignancies
with a cumulative incidence approaching 50% at 50 years of
age [24, 25].
Initial HSCT attempts using myeloablative conditioning
resulted in high morbidity and mortality, notably from
pulmonary ﬁbrosis [26]. Several case reports of successful
transplantation using nonmyeloablative regimens have been
published [27, 28]. A series of six patients receiving unrelated
donor bone marrow (one 8/8, one 7/8), unrelated double
cords (4/6 for both cords in one patient, and 4/6 and 5/6
for two other patients), and HLA-identical related peripheral
blood stem cells used nonmyeloablative conditioning with
cyclophosphamide, ﬂudarabine, alemtuzumab, and 200 cGy
TBI [29]. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and
mycophenolate. Five patients engrafted (one patient died
prior to engraftment at 1 month); two out of six patients
died from infectious complications, two patients developed
aGVHD (skin, gut) Grade II–IV, and one patient developed
chronic skin GVHD; overall survival was 67% with median
follow-up of 2 years. The authors’ review of published case
reports using non-myeloablative conditioning in transplan-
tation for DC (excluding the authors’ six reported patients)
yielded 18 patients (11 related bone marrow transplants,
5 unrelated bone marrow transplants, 2 unrelated cord
transplants). 91% of related transplant recipients were alive
with a median follow-up of two years. 40% of matched-
unrelated transplant recipients were alive with a median
4 Bone Marrow Research
follow-up of 15 months; there was a high incidence of GVHD
in the 60% of patients that died. Transplantation using
reduced intensity conditioning is therefore indicated for DC
given its high probability of bone marrow failure and death,
with expected two year post-transplant survival rates of 40–
90% depending upon stem cell source.
5. Severe Congenital Neutropenia
Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a constellation
of syndromes consisting of arrested myeloid development
resulting in neutropenia. The genetic pathology is largely
due to mutations in ELA2 and GFI1; a subset of patients
have mutations in the Hax1 gene (Kostmann’s neutropenia)
and rare, congenital X-linked mutations in CSF3R [30].
The natural history of the disease includes infectious com-
plications and, consistent with other bone marrow failure
syndromes, an elevated risk of myelodysplastic and leukemic
transformation. Approximately 90% of patients respond to
GCSF administration with a subsequent decrease in sepsis-
related mortality to almost 1% per year during the ﬁrst
decade of life [31]. However, GCSF poor and nonrespon-
ders remain at particularly high risk for hematopoietic
dysplasia/malignancy with a cumulative incidence of 21%
following 10 years of GCSF therapy that was thought
to dramatically climb thereafter [31]. However recently
updated North American registry data suggest a relative
plateau in the hematologic malignancy risk after 10–15 years,
similar to that seen in Fanconi Anemia and dyskeratosis
congenita [32]. It is thought that the SCN pathology and
degree of severity particularly predisposes to malignancy
as the incidence of MDS/AML transformation at 10 years
was only 15% for patients without neutropenia on GCSF
versus 34% for patients with persistent neutrophil counts
below 2100/microliter despite high doses (greater than
8 mcg/kg/day) of GCSF. Although it remains controversial
if prolonged GCSF therapy predisposes to malignant trans-
formation it is notable that large cohorts of other patients
receiving chronic GCSF therapy for cyclic and idiopathic
neutropenia have not reported malignant transformation
[33]. Furthermore the risk of malignant transformation in
SCN patients receiving high doses of GCSF does not appear
to be greater than other bone marrow failure syndromes
with high malignancy rates such as Fanconi Anemia and
dyskeratosis congenita [32].
Zeidler et al. reported 11 SCN patients without malig-
nancy who received HSCT [34]; 8 received sibling-matched
transplants (5 BMT, 1 cord, 1 BMT and cord, 1 PBSC)
and 10 received myeloablative conditioning with busul-
fan/cyclophosphamide ± ATG, thiotepa, or melphalan.
All patients receiving myeloablative conditioning engrafted
regardless of source although 40% of tested patients had
graft chimerism (30%–84% donor) at 6–12 months post-
transplant. Acute GVHD grade II–IV was present in 2
of the unrelated BMT recipients. Overall survival of the
10 patients receiving myeloablative regimens was 80% at
median follow-up of 10 months. The French SCN registry
reported HSCT outcomes on 5 SCN patients without
malignant transformation. Donors included unrelated cords
(2) and unrelated bone marrows (2), and related bone
marrow (1). All received myeloablative regimens with 80%
engraftment and 40% mortality due to infection at one year
post-transplant [35]. In contrast, 18 Japanese patients with
SCN without malignant transformation underwent trans-
plantation from sibling-matched (9) or matched-unrelated
donors (9) following myeloablative conditioning in 12 cases
and non-myeloablative in the remaining 6 patients. Although
four patients encountered primary graft failure (including
two sibling matched donor transplants) and received a
second transplant, 16 of the 18 patients are considered
disease-free with a median follow-up of 6 years [36].
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in SCN patients
in the setting of MDS/AML carries high mortality (60%–
80% as reported in case series [37] and 1998 SCNIR registry
data) but is the only curative option. Choi et al. [37] reported
6 SCN patients with transformation to MDS (2) or AML (4)
at a median age of 13 years old; patients received sibling-
matched (1), matched-unrelated (3), or single mismatch
unrelated (2) donors and were conditioned with busulfan-
based (5) or TBI-based (1) regimens. The two MDS patients
did not receive induction chemotherapy, engrafted, and were
disease-free from 2 to 4 years posttransplant, although both
remain on immunosuppression for chronic GVHD. The four
AML patients received induction chemotherapy and were
transplanted in complete remission; those receiving single-
mismatched grafts had primary graft failure. Ultimately all
four patients died: two died from chronic GVHD, one died
from primary graft failure, and one died from relapsed
AML. The French SCN registry [35] reported four SCN
patients transplanted for MDS (3) and ALL (1) who received
unrelated cords, bone marrows, or related bone marrow after
myeloablative conditioning. All four patients engrafted and
three survived (one died from septic shock) with median
followup of 2 years. One patient required a second transplant
for relapsed MDS/AML. Of note, 2 of the 3 MDS patients did
not receive induction chemotherapy prior to transplant.
Transplantation is therefore indicated for patients unre-
sponsive to GCSF and should be strongly considered for mild
response to high doses of GCSF given this group’s risk of
malignancy and the disparity between transplant survival
prior to malignant transformation compared to afterwards.
The utility of induction chemotherapy is unknown in
patients with MDS, as successful donor engraftment and
relapse-free survival without induction chemotherapy have
been demonstrated [35].
6. Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome
Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal
recessive disorder associated with mutation in the Shwach-
man Bodian Diamond Syndrome gene, SBDS, involved in
ribosomal biogenesis and mitotic spindle association. The
disorder is classically associated with neutropenia (intermit-
tent or chronic) and exocrine pancreas deﬁciency. However,
patients often have multiple hematopoietic cell lineage
involvement with anemia and thrombocytopenia seen in
Bone Marrow Research 5
up to 80% of patients [38] and stromal cell abnormalities
have also been reported [39]. Other ﬁndings include skeletal,
cardiac, endocrine, and renal abnormalities.
Similar to Fanconi Anemia and dyskeratosis congenita,
SDS patients have an increased risk for the development of
MDS and AML. The French SCN registry recorded a 19%
cumulative incidence of MDS/AML by 20 years of age in 55
SDS patients; this incidence increased to 36% by 30 years
of age [40]. In contrast, the NCI’s IBMF registry of 17 SDS
patients followed for a cumulative duration of 274 person-
years did not observe any malignancy development [25];
further registry followup with more patients is necessary
to more accurately identify SDS patients’ true malignancy
predisposition.
Donadieu et al. reported the outcomes of 10 SDS patients
receiving HSCT; 5 of the patients were transplanted for
bone marrow failure without malignancy [41]. Four received
unrelated BMT (either 9/10 or 10/10 HLA-matched) and one
received a sibling-matched BMT. Myeloablative conditioning
utilized busulfan-based (3) or TBI-based (2) regimens, with
3 patients also receiving ATG. All ﬁve patients engrafted and
were alive at a median of 8 years with no chronic GVHD
grade III-IV. The study also reported ﬁve SDS patients
transplanted for MDS (4) and leukemic (1) transformation
with sibling-matched donors (3) and 9/10 MUD (2) [41].
Myeloablative conditioning was with busulfan (3) or TBI (2)
regimens. Only one patient received induction chemother-
apy. Four patients died; two died of sepsis and organ toxicity
prior to 40 days posttransplant, one patient relapsed at 5
months, and one died of respiratory complications at 1.7
years post-transplant. Other myeloablative regimens have
reported high transplant-related mortality with signiﬁcantly
elevated transplant-related cardiac toxicity [42]. A review of
27 case-reported SDS patients transplanted using myeloabla-
tive conditioning demonstrated a 18% mortality in patients
transplanted for cytopenias(s) versus a 53% mortality rate in
patients with active dysplasia/malignancy [43].
Reduced-intensity conditioning has been successfully
used in SDS patients. Sauer et al. used a conditioning
regimen of ﬂudarabine, treosulfan, and melphalan in three
recipients transplanted for pancytopenia (2) and MDS (1)
[44]. Two patients were alive at 16 and 24 months post-
transplant without respiratory complications; one patient
transplanted for pancytopenia died at Day +98 due to
idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. Bhatla et al. reported seven
transplanted patients conditioned with alemtuzumab, ﬂu-
darabine, and melphalan in varying states of hypocellularity
[45]. One patient was transplanted for AML postinduction
chemotherapy, another for MDS. 57% received sibling-
matched marrow stem cells; the remaining three patients
received unrelated peripheral blood or bone marrow stem
cells. All 7 patients engrafted and were alive with median
followup of 1.5 years. There was no acute GVHD Grade
III-IV using prophylactic treatment with cyclosporine and
methotrexate/steroids (depending on stem cell source).
Transplantation in SDS patients with active dysplasia or
malignancy is associated with signiﬁcantly higher mortality.
The risk of malignancy is elevated although to what degree
is unclear. Therefore, close surveillance of these patients is
advised for early detection of worsening cytopenias with
clonal evolution. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens
have been successfully used in limited series with good
engraftment rates and decreased transplant-related mortal-
ity.
7. Conclusions
The bone marrow failure syndromes constitute a het-
erogeneous group of molecular pathologies that share a
phenotype of hematopoietic disruption. Hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation remains the only curative treatment
option at present but the indications for transplant are
dependent upon the predisposition to severe bone marrow
failure/malignancy transformation and must be balanced
against the known increased transplant-related complication
rates seen in such patients. Furthermore, it is important
for physicians to recognize the potential for underlying
BMFS in patients, regardless of age, presenting with aplasia
and to tailor the diagnostic workup and potential trans-
plantation regimen accordingly. Of note, BMFS-associated
aplastic anemia does not respond to the immunosuppressive
therapy regimens used for acquired aplastic anemia. There-
fore time should not be wasted with such treatments as
subsequent malignant transformation may result in severely
increased transplantation-related mortality, most notably
reported in patients with severe congenital neutropenia
and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. In addition, patients
with Fanconi’s Anemia and dyskeratosis congenita require
reduced intensity conditioning regimens that likely hinder
transplantation survival in the setting of malignancy.
It is imperative that BMFS patients are entered into
their respective registries. These databases enable these rare
patients to be studied in a systematic fashion for both
immediate and long-term sequelae. Late transplant-related
eﬀects may be seen in nearly any organ system, with
notable risks for cardiac, pulmonary, renal [46], endocrine,
psychiatric, and fertility dysfunction [47]. Limited data on
survivors of pediatric HSCT report “good” quality of life
with median Lansky/Karnofsky performance scores of 90
[48]. Furthermore, transplant survivors of nonmalignant
disorders may enjoy a superior health-related quality of life
relative to survivors of malignant disorders [49]. However,
given the known increased incidence in transplant-related
morbidity as well as nonhematopoietic complications in
BMFS patients it will be important for the registries to
continue their long-term followup.
