Abstract
Background: Human infection with parvovirus B19 may lead to a diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations,
including benign erythema infectiosum in children, transient aplastic crisis in patients with haemolytic anaemia,
and congenital hydrops foetalis. These different diseases represent direct consequences of the ability of parvovirus
B19 to target the erythroid cell lineage. However, accumulating evidence suggests that this virus can also infect
other cell types resulting in diverse clinical manifestations, of which the pathogenesis remains to be fully
elucidated. This has prompted important questions regarding the tropism of the virus and its possible involvement
in a broad range of infectious and autoimmune medical conditions.
Case Presentation: Here, we present an unusual case of persistent parvovirus B19 infection as a cause of chronic
hepatitis. This patient had persistent parvovirus B19 viraemia over a period of more than four years and displayed
signs of chronic hepatitis evidenced by fluctuating elevated levels of ALAT and a liver biopsy demonstrating
chronic hepatitis. Other known causes of hepatitis and liver damage were excluded. In addition, the patient was
evaluated for immunodeficiency, since she had lymphopenia both prior to and following clearance of parvovirus
B19 infection.
Conclusions: In this case report, we describe the current knowledge on the natural history and pathogenesis of
parvovirus B19 infection, and discuss the existing evidence of parvovirus B19 as a cause of acute and chronic
hepatitis. We suggest that parvovirus B19 was the direct cause of this patient’s chronic hepatitis, and that she had
an idiopathic lymphopenia, which may have predisposed her to persistent infection, rather than bone marrow
depression secondary to infection. In addition, we propose that her liver involvement may have represented a viral
reservoir. Finally, we suggest that clinicians should be aware of parvovirus B19 as an unusual aetiology of chronic
hepatitis, when other causes have been ruled out.
Background
Human infection with parvovirus B19 may lead to a
diverse spectrum of clinical manifestations, including
benign erythema infectiosum in children, transient
aplastic crisis in patients with haemolytic anaemia, and
congenital hydrops foetalis. These different diseases
represent direct consequences of the ability of parvo-
virus B19 to target the erythroid cell lineage. Recently
however, parvovirus B19 infection has been associated
with diseases involving other cell types. This has
prompted important questions regarding the tropism of
the virus and its possible involvement in the
pathogenesis of a broad range of medical conditions,
including idiopathic arthritis [1], vasculitis [2], menin-
goencephalitis [3], hepatitis [4], and myocarditis [5].
Here, we present an unusual case of chronic hepatitis in
a patient with persistent parvovirus B19 infection. We
describe the current knowledge on the pathogenesis and
clinical manifestations of parvovirus B19 infection and
discuss the evidence of parvovirus B19 as a cause of
acute and chronic hepatitis.
Case presentation
A previously healthy 50-year old female was referred to
the outpatient clinic of a general hospital due to exces-
sive fatigue and exanthema. Five month prior to the eva-
luation, she had an episode of febrile illness with
influenza-like symptoms followed by the appearance of

an exanthema. At that time, a dermatologist made a
presumptive diagnosis of vasculitis and prescribed pre-
dnisolone, after which the exanthema had subsided.
There had been no neurological, cardiopulmonary or
gastrointestinal symptoms, and no arthralgias, weight
loss or fever. The patient did not have any history of
alcohol or intravenous drug abuse and did not drink any
alcohol throughout her disease. The physical examina-
tion was unremarkable.
Routine blood tests revealed slight lymphopenia (0.86 ×
109
/L) and thrombocytopenia (122 × 109
/L) but no anae-
mia (haemoglobin 8.5 mmol/L). In addition, modest
elevations of liver enzymes were noted with ALAT of
57 U/L as well as normal tests of renal function. Markers
of inflammation, such as CRP and ESR, were within the
normal range.
An infectious aetiology of the patients’ symptoms was
suspected. Hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV, and borrelia
serologies were all negative. In addition, PCR for HIV-
and HCV-RNA were negative. Antibody titres for EBV,
CMV, HHV6, parvovirus B19 and toxoplasmosis were
IgG positive but IgM negative. However, PCR for parvo-
virus B19 DNA in serum was positive, suggesting
chronic parvovirus B19 infection. In order to exclude
the possibility of autoimmune disease, ANA, ANCA,
rheumatoid factor, and anti-phospholipid antibodies
were evaluated and were all negative. Moreover,
smooth-muscle cell antibody and mitochondrial anti-
body were negative, excluding autoimmune hepatitis
and primary biliary cirrosis, respectively. Finally, coeru-
loplasmin, s-ACE, and s-ferroxidase were also analysed
to rule out other aetiologies of hepatic damage.
Due to persistent symptoms and positive parvovirus
B19 DNA in serum, the patient was evaluated for an
immunodeficiency. The CD4 positive T cell count was
reduced (261-330 cells/mL), but further analysis demon-
strated equally reduced T lymphocyte numbers in all
subpopulations, including CD4- and CD8- positive sub-
sets. Additionally, a markedly reduced B lymphocyte
and NK cell count was found, although with normal NK
cell function. The serum concentrations of IgA, IgM
and IgG, including IgG subclasses, were all normal.
These immunological and haematological values are
depicted in figure 1.
The patients’ symptoms of fatigue, fluctuating eleva-
tions of ALAT, and moderate lymphopenia were unal-
tered for more than one year with persistent evidence of
parvovirus DNA in serum measured by PCR every
6 months. A therapeutic trial was made with high-dose
intravenous immunoglobulin infusions for five days and

percentages of reference values over time (t = 0: time of initial symptoms). Reference values were chosen as the lowest of the normal range,
with the exception of ALAT, for which the highest normal range value was used. Time points for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),
prednisolone treatment, liver biopsy, and parvovirus B19 DNA status are indicated.

repeated twice over as period of 5 months. Unfortu-
nately, the treatment did not result in the clearance of
parvovirus B19 DNA from serum.
Due to persistently elevated levels of ALAT, a liver
biopsy was performed three years after the onset of the
illness. Histology demonstrated slight to moderate portal
chronic inflammation with focal interface hepatitis as
well as portal and periportal fibrosis with scattered foci
of bridging fibrosis. A histopathological diagnosis of
chronic hepatitis was made (Figure 2).
Four years after the debut of symptoms, parvovirus
B19 DNA in serum for the first time was undetectable.
Notably, the level of ALAT also was normal. However,
her lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia persisted,
although it was less pronounced (Figure 1). At that
time, the patient reported being well and slowly regain-
ing her normal level of activity as prior to her parvo-
virus B19 infection. Immunological evaluation after one
more year demonstrated persistent lymphopenia (330
cells/mL) and thrombocytopenia (220 cells/mL) but nor-
mal NK cell function.
Discussion
Human parvovirus B19 infection is frequent with most
infections occurring during childhood and as much as
65% of the adult population affected as evidenced by
seropositivity [4]. The natural history of parvovirus B19
infection in humans is biphasic with an initial febrile
state accompanied by non-specific influenza-like symp-
toms due to viral replication in the upper respiratory
tract and spread by viraemia to the bone marrow. The
virus enters erythroid progenitor cells through the ery-
throcyte blood group P antigen and subsequently repli-
cates and establishes lytic infection. The second
symptomatic stage of the illness, which is immune
mediated, is precipitated by the appearance of virus-
specific IgM antibodies, inhibition of viraemia, and
formation of immune complexes responsible for a macu-
lopapular exanthema and polyarthritis. In children, the
classical picture of erythema infectiosum is a distinctive
rash on the cheeks, whereas in adults, polyarthritis domi-
nates and may be preceded by a universal rash. Viral
DNA is typically present in serum up to 6 months after
onset of symptoms [6]. Therefore, detection of viral DNA
later than this time is suggestive of persistent infection.
Several studies have implicated parvovirus B19 in var-
ious different types of pathology of the liver. First, sev-
eral reports have suggested a pathogenic role for
parvovirus B19 in the development of acute hepatitis
[7-9] and fulminant liver failure of unknown aetiology
[10,11]. Furthermore, persistence of B19 DNA in liver
and bone marrow has been associated with acute liver
disease and aplastic anaemia [9,12,13]. Furthermore,
interest has focused on a possible effect of co-infection
with parvovirus B19 on the natural history of chronic
hepatitis B and C. By examining serum samples from
patients, Hsu et al. found that parvovirus B19 DNA was
frequently present in patients with chronic hepatitis B
and C, indicating that parvovirus B19 may not be eradi-
cated in these patients [14]. However, co-infection of
parvovirus B19 with hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis
B virus (HBV) did not increase the frequency of liver
dysfunction [14]. This is in contrast to another study, in
which a significant correlation between parvovirus B19
co-infection and a greater likelihood of progression to
more severe HBV-associated liver disease was reported
in Vietnamese patients [15]. Finally in a study involving
European patients, intrahepatic long-term persistence of
parvovirus B19 in both end-stage liver tissue and routine
biopsies was demonstrated, but parvovirus B19 DNA
was only very rarely detected in serum samples from
hepatitis B and C patients, and no evidence was found
for parvovirus B19 as a factor worsening liver disease in
chronic hepatitis C [16].
The precise role of parvovirus B19 as a bona fide
hepatitis virus directly causing chronic hepatitis remains
controversial, but based on the paucity of cases reported
in the literature, this clinical manifestation seems to be
very rare. One case described an immunocompetent
male patient presenting with persistent fever, jaundice,
polyarthritis, and evidence of persistent B19 infection
[4]. Another case was described by Pinho et al., who
reported the presence of active B19 infection in one
patient with hepatitis among 129 cases analysed with
non A-E hepatitis [17]. The patient, a 56-year old female
patient with severe hepatitis and submassive necrosis by
liver biopsy, was PCR positive for B19 DNA in blood as
well as in liver tissue. However, the patient described by
Figure 2 Liver biopsy with chronic hepatitis. An expanded portal
tract shows chronic inflammation with a modest degree of active
interface hepatitis. On the upper right hand side of the figure is an
area of bridging septal fibrosis. (Haematoxylin and eosin staining).

Pinho differs significantly from our patient, since an
autoimmune cause could not be ruled out, prompting
treatment with prednisolone and azathioprin [17]. The
patient we describe here was also persistently B19 DNA
positive in blood by PCR and her liver biopsy taken
after approximately 3 years of active infection displayed
signs of chronic inflammation and moderate fibrosis.
Furthermore, alternative infectious and non-infectious
causes of chronic hepatitis and liver pathology were
ruled out. We therefore believe that her chronic hepati-
tis was caused by persistent parvovirus B19 infection.
This is supported by normalization of ALAT after clear-
ance of parvovirus B19 from blood. Importantly, viral
clearance could not be attributed to immunoglobulin
treatment, since it happened at least three years later as
illustrated in figure 1. Immunoglobulin infusions have
been reported to be successful in treating chronic parvo-
virus B19 infection, particularly in immunocompromised
individuals, but in the absence of randomized trials, no
evidence or consensus has been reached [18].
The mechanism by which parvovirus B19 induces liver
pathology and failure remains unknown. In vitro parvo-
virus B19 is able to enter hepatocytes through binding
to the P antigen (globoside) [19], although hepatocytes
are assumed to be non-permissive for parvovirus repli-
cation [20]. One mechanism suggested for B19-induced
hepatopathy include effects of the viral protein non-
structural protein (NS) 1 through activation of interleu-
kin-6 expression [21]. More recently, Poole et al.
demonstrated parvovirus B19-induced apoptosis of
hepatocytes induced by NS1 and mediated through an
intrinsic caspase pathway, involving caspases 3 and 9
[22,23]. Indeed, authors in this field have suggested that
it should be further investigated, whether intense liver
involvement predisposes or correlates with persistent
parvovirus B19 infection [4]. However, given that the
prevalence of parvovirus B19 in healthy tissue remains
unknown, it is difficult to demonstrate the role of parvo-
virus B19 in the aetiology of hepatitis, since the mere
presence of viral DNA in tissue can not be used to infer
causality [13,16]. Thus, whether parvovirus B19 is a
pathogenic agent of fulminant liver failure and non A-E
hepatitis, a risk factor accelerating liver dysfunction due
to other agents, or alternatively a bystander with no
influence on liver pathology, is still unresolved.
Parvovirus B19 infection was previously considered a
cause of chronic infection only in immunocompromised
individuals, in whom symptomatic B19 infection and
anaemia may persist for months or even years [24,25].
More recently, the existence of a chronic type of infec-
tion associated with continuous virus production has
been established, and this clinical entity may occur also
in apparently immunocompetent individuals [4]. This
raises the question, as to whether our patient may have
been immunocompromised prior to her parvovirus B19
infection, or whether the observed lymphopenia was
merely a result of longstanding chronic viral infection,
which may per se cause immunosuppression [26]. In
addition, prednisolone treatment may have caused a
degree of immunosuppression. The patient exhibited
decreases in T lymphocyte and NK cell populations,
which were present early in the course of disease and
persisted for years after clearance of parvovirus B19
infection, suggesting that they were not secondary to
infection but rather predisposed her to chronic parvo-
virus B19 infection. It is notable, however, that she did
not at any time develop anaemia, which might have
been suspected. [27,28].
Conclusions
In most cases, Parvovirus B19 infection causes relatively
benign self-limiting disease. However, accumulating evi-
dence suggests that this virus can also affect other cell
types resulting in diverse clinical manifestations, of
which the pathogenesis remains to be fully elucidated.
Here, we have described an unusual case of persistent
parvovirus B19 infection as a cause of chronic hepatitis
[27,28]. The patient described here developed persistent
infection despite the presence of normal humoral
immune competence and did not have anaemia but
rather had hepatic involvement as the primary manifes-
tation. This may suggest that the liver represented the
main viral reservoir of this patient’s persistently active
infection. Finally, it cannot be ruled out that her idio-
pathic lymphopenia may have predisposed her to persis-
tent infection. Clinicians should be aware that
parvovirus B19 may be a rare cause of hepatic pathol-
ogy, when other causes of hepatitis have been ruled out.
