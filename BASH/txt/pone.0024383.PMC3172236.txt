Abstract
The bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita (DC) has been considered to be a disorder of telomere
maintenance in which disease features arise due to accelerated shortening of telomeres. By screening core components of
the telomerase and shelterin complexes in patients with DC and related bone marrow failure syndromes we have identified
24 novel mutations: 11 in the RNA component of telomerase (TERC), 8 in the reverse transcriptase component (TERT), 4 in
dyskerin (DKC1) and 1 in TRF1-interacting nuclear factor 2 (TINF2). This has prompted us to review these genetic subtypes in
terms of telomere length, telomerase activity and clinical presentation among 194 genetically characterised index cases
recruited onto the registry in London. While those with DKC1 and TINF2 mutations present at a younger age and have more
disease features than those with TERC or TERT mutations, there is no difference in telomere length between these groups.
There is no difference in the age of onset and numbers of disease features seen in those with TERC and TERT mutations
despite the fact that the latter show higher levels of telomerase activity in vitro. The incidence of aplastic anaemia is greater
in patients with TERC or TINF2 mutations compared to patients with DKC1 mutations, and cancer incidence is highest in
patients with TERC mutations. These data are the first to provide robust comparisons between different genetic subtypes of
telomerase and shelterin mutations (the ‘‘telomereopathies’’) and clearly demonstrate that disease severity is not explained
by telomere length alone.

Introduction
Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that protect chromo-
some ends, distinguishing them from double strand breaks that
might occur elsewhere in the genome and need repair [1].
Telomeric DNA consists of a TTAGGG repeat sequence that is
bound by a protein complex known as shelterin [2]. Because of the
end-replication problem [3] telomeres shorten with each cell
division and when they become critically short, a p53-dependent
checkpoint is activated that leads to apoptosis or cell senescence
[4–6]. It has been suggested that this mitotic clock has a tumour-
suppressor function in long lived mammals, giving cells a limited
lifespan and hence restricting the accumulation of DNA damage
[7]. Telomere shortening has therefore been linked to the
processes of both aging [8] and cancer [9]. In the germ line and
in some stem cells, telomeric DNA can be replenished by
telomerase, a ribonucloeprotein complex that involves an RNA
template and a reverse transcriptase [10].
Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an inherited multi-system
disorder classically characterized by a mucocutaneous triad of
abnormal skin pigmentation, nail dystrophy and leukoplakia [11].
DC patients frequently develop bone marrow failure and are at a
high risk of developing cancer [12] as well as a variety of other
features [13,14]. DC is clinically and genetically heterogeneous.
Eight disease genes (DKC1, TERC, TERT, NOP10, NHP2, TINF2,
C16orf57 and TCAB1) have been identified to date [15–22] and all
but one are known to be involved in telomere maintenance. The
four most common genetic subtypes of DC are those that involve
either the core components of the telomerase complex [23], the
RNA (TERC), the reverse transcriptase (TERT) and the accessory
protein dyskerin (DKC1), or the shelterin component, the telomeric
repeat binding factor 1-interacting nuclear factor 2 (TINF2).
It is not surprising therefore that DC has been considered to
represent the clinical manifestation of defective telomere mainte-
nance and indeed, very short telomeres are a hallmark of this
disease [24–26]. However, there is a broad clinical spectrum
associated with these mutations and patients can present with a
number of overlapping disorders, characterised by one or more of
a constellation of clinical features [7,27]. In addition to DC, these
include the Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson (HH) syndrome [28], which is
characterised by a variety of features including bone marrow
failure, growth retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, enteropathy and

immunodeficiency. Other patients may present with only aplastic
anaemia (AA) [29,30], myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) [31,32],
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) [33] pulmonary fibrosis [34,35]
and liver fibrosis [36], and collectively these can be referred to as
the ‘telomereopathies’.
We have been screening telomere-related genes among patients
referred, primarily with bone marrow failure, to our registry in
London and in this paper we report on 24 novel mutations. The
variable clinical presentation among these patients has prompted
us to review the clinical features, telomere length and mutation
status among 194 genetically characterised index cases. While
there are clear differences between the genetic subgroups in terms
of clinical presentation, we find that the range of telomere length is
similar in each group. We conclude that telomere length alone
does not account for variation in disease severity between the
different genetic subtypes.
Results
Novel mutations in telomerase and shelterin
components
Through mutation screening in patients with DC and related
bone marrow failure syndromes, we have identified 23 novel
mutations in core components of telomerase: 11 in TERC, 8 in
TERT and 4 in DKC1 (Table 1, Figures S1 and S2). Two
additional TERT mutations were identified during the course of
this study which have been reported elsewhere in unrelated
families [15,37]. One mutation in the shelterin component TINF2
has been identified (reported also by Sasa et al [38] while this
paper was in preparation) which is in addition to the 8 TINF2
mutations that we have recently reported elsewhere [39]. All
TERC, TERT and TINF2 mutations were heterozygous, while the
DKC1 mutations are hemizygous (X-linked). None have been
reported previously and none are reported among previous screens
of normal healthy individuals [15,16,20,30] or on dbSNP or the
1000 genomes database. The clear majority (8/11) of the TERC
mutations disrupt base pairing in the pseudoknot region of the
molecule and they look like classic disease causing mutations
(Figure S1). Of all 45 disease-associated TERC mutations that are
known to us, 30 are located in the pseudoknot. Also consistent with
previous findings [30,36,37], the TERT mutations are spread
throughout the molecule and show variable degrees of conserva-
tion across species (Figure S2). Polyphen conservation scores
support the notion that most of these mutations are disruptive: 8/
10 are predicted to be probably damaging (score = 0.94921.0) and
one is possibly damaging (Val56Leu, score = 0.433); the only one
predicted to be benign (Arg972His, score = 0.059) is seen in
combination with a second substitution, Gly1063Asp, which has
been reported in another patient elsewhere [37].
There is a broad spectrum of clinical presentation among these
patients, ranging from early onset of features resembling the HH
syndrome to a patient presenting at the age of 55 years with MDS.
It is noteworthy that of the 21 index cases with TERC or TERT
mutations only 7 had sufficient clinical features to be classified as
DC or HH; 14 out of the 21 were classified as having either
idiopathic AA, constitutional AA or MDS. Another striking
observation here is that of the patients with TERC mutations, only
one reports that a family member had presented with any features
related to the disease (Table 1, column ‘FH’). A lack of family
history is normal among patients with TINF2 mutations due to the
fact that these mutations usually arise de novo. However, this is not
the case for the TERC families: when no family history is reported
and both parents are available, one of these parents is usually an
asymptomatic carrier.
TERC mutations cause lower telomerase activity than
TERT mutations
The in vitro telomerase activity of the TERC and TERT
mutations, as determined by the telomere repeat amplification
protocol (TRAP assay) may act as a guide to the clinical
penetrance of these different alleles. It is noticeable that for all
but one of the TERC mutations, the TRAP activity is ,12% of
wild type (Table 1, Figure 1A). The exception is the TERC
242C.T mutation, which gives an activity of 47611%; this
mutation is located in a loop bordering the CR4-CR5 domain of
the molecule, away from other disease-causing alleles. It is seen in
a patient who has HH, consanguineous parents, and whose
asymptomatic mother and sister are also heterozygous; this may
therefore not be the pathogenic lesion in this family.
In contrast, only 2/7 of the TERT mutations give a TRAP
activity of ,10% wild type, while the others give an activity .15%
normal (Table 1, Figure 1B). When we include mutations that we
have analysed previously, (14 in TERC and 8 in TERT), we see
that as a group, the TERC mutations give significantly lower
telomerase activity than the TERT mutations (Figure 1C,
Student’s t-test P-value = 0.04).
Disease severity varies between different genetic
subtypes
These novel data have prompted us to review the clinical and
biological manifestations of different mutations across a large series
of patients referred to our registry in London. We have
information relating to 194 index cases in which we have defined
the genetic basis of the disease: 91 with DKC1, 56 with TINF2, 30
with TERC and 17 with TERT mutations. As indicators of disease
severity, we have compared the age of report and the number of
presenting disease features between the different subtypes
(Figure 2). No difference is seen in either category between
patients with TERC and TERT mutations. However, those with
DKC1 mutations present at a significantly younger age compared
to those with TERC mutations (Student’s t-test, P-value ,.0001)
and have a significantly greater number of disease features than
those with both TERC and TERT mutations (P-value ,.0001).
Those with TINF2 mutations present at a younger age than those
with both TERC and TERT mutations (P-value ,.0001 and 0.008,
respectively) and have more disease features than those with TERC
mutations (P-value = 0.027).
We have also investigated the relative incidence of several
clinically significant disease features: the presence of 2 or more of
the classical mucocutaneous features, AA, cancer, pulmonary
disease, cerebellar hypoplasia and short stature (Table 2). Again,
no difference is seen in any category between patients with TERC
and TERT mutations. However, mucocutaneous features are far
less common in patients with either TERC or TERT mutations
compared to DKC1 (Pearson’s chi-squared test, P-value ,0.0001).
Patients with TINF2 mutations are also less likely to have
mucocutaneous features than the DKC1 patients (P-value =
0.006), but are more likely to have them than in either TERC or
TERT patients (P-value = 0.014 and 0.019, respectively). The
incidence of AA is less among patients with DKC1 mutations than
either TERC or TINF2 patients (P-value = 0.007 and 0.006,
respectively); this is despite the fact that the TINF2 patient group is
younger than the DKC1 group, while the TERC group is older than
the DKC1 group. Cancer incidence is higher among patients with
TERC and TERT mutations, significantly so compared to the
TINF2 group (P-value = 0.003 and 0.011, respectively); this may
well reflect the fact that they are generally an older patient group.
Telomere Length and Disease Severity

Telomere lengths do not explain differences in disease
severity between genetic subtypes
Despite the fact that we see significant differences in clinical
severity between the different genetic subtypes of patients, both in
terms of age of presentation and the number of disease features, we do
not see any difference in telomere lengths between these groups of
index cases. This is true whether we compare age adjusted (Figure 3A)
or absolute (Figure 3B) telomere lengths as measured by Southern
blot analysis, or when we compare telomere lengths determined by
quantitative PCR (Figure 3C). Plots of telomere length against age
(Figure 3D and 3E) are consistent with the idea that disease presents
when telomeres shorten below a certain length, independent of age.
Taking all index cases together, there is no correlation between
telomere length and either age of report (Figure 4A) or number of
disease features (Figure 4B). The same is true if each subtype is
analysed separately (Figures S3 and S4), although there is a trend
toward earlier presentation with shorter telomeres among patients
with TINF2 mutations (R2
= 0.424). However, we do see that
among patients with DKC1 mutations, those that present with the
severe HH syndrome have shorter telomeres than those that
present with more classical DC (P-value = 0.03, Figure 5A).
Somewhat surprisingly, when we compare all patients who did
and did not present with bone marrow failure, we do not see any
difference in telomere length (Figure 5B).

Another factor that can be taken into consideration is the number
of asymptomatic relatives (both younger and older) that exist in each
of the subtypes: while we know of very few asymptomatic relatives
with TINF2 or DKC1 mutations, this is a common feature of families
with TERC and TERT mutations. It has been proposed that is at
least in part due to disease anticipation in families with both TERC
and TERT mutations, and that this is associated with progressive
telomere shortening through the generations. We now know of 27
parent-child combinations from 15 different families in which both
are TERC heterozygotes. In all but 4 of these combinations, the
affected child has a shorter age-adjusted telomere length than their
affected parent (Figure 5C). As a group, the children have
significantly shorter telomeres than the parents (P value = 0.0026)
with a median difference in Dtel between parent and child (Dtel,
child-Dtel, parent) of 21.53 kb.
Discussion
This is the first study to systematically review the relationship
between telomere length and disease severity in a large cohort of
Figure 1. TERC mutations have lower residual telomerase activity than TERT mutations. Telomerase activity of (A) novel TERC mutations
and (B) novel TERT mutations were determined using the TRAP assay and are expressed as a % of wild-type activity. (C) A comparison of all TERC
mutations (n = 23, blue circles) and TERT mutations (n = 15, pink diamonds) that we have studied shows that as a group, the TERC mutations give
significantly lower residual telomerase activity (* P value = 0.04). Black bars indicate median values.

subtypes, there is no difference in the range of telomere lengths

several previous studies have indicated that disease severity may be
related to telomere length. These include the phenomenon of

disease anticipation associated with telomere shortening in families
with TERC and TERT mutations [17,40,41], shorter telomeres
among patients with TINF2 mutations [42], and patients with
severe disease caused by DKC1 mutations having shorter telomeres
than those with mild disease [43].
There are several differences between previous studies and the one
we present here. Firstly, we are now looking at a considerably larger
number of patients with telomere defects, representing the largest
series published to date. Secondly, we have focused on the index cases
only to avoid the issues relating to asymptomatic individuals with
telomerase/shelterin mutations, particularly in the context of disease
anticipation. Thirdly, we are comparing different genetic subtypes of
the disease, rather than looking within a single subtype.
The four common genetic subtypes of DC (caused by mutations
in the DKC1, TINF2, TERC, and TERT genes) can be divided into
three groups: (i) the inherited autosomal dominant mutations in
the telomerase-specific components, TERC and TERT; (ii) the X-
linked recessive mutations in DKC1, encoding a protein that acts as
a pseudouridine synthase in H/ACA small nuclear ribonucleo-
protein (snoRNP) complexes [44], predominantly involved in
ribosomal RNA processing [45], as well as a core component of
telomerase; and (iii) the predominantly de novo mutations in TINF2,
encoding a core component of the telomere-binding protein
complex, shelterin [46,47]. Mutations in any of these genes can
clearly impact dramatically on the ability to maintain telomere
length and result in a multisystem disease. However, the fact that
Figure 4. No correlation between telomere length and clinical presentation. Among all index cases (n = 118) there is no correlation seen
between telomere length and either (A) the age at report (R2
= 0.062) or (B) the number of disease features observed (R2
= 0.007). Symbols for the
different disease subgroups are as described for Figure 3.

three different pathways are affected in the different genetic
subtypes may explain why telomere length alone does not
correlate with disease severity. This suggests other biological
defects are likely to be important in the disease pathology and the
resulting overall clinical phenotype. Although there is no clear
evidence of a defect in pseudouridylation in patients with DKC1
mutations [48,49], several studies have indicated that in mice they
can have a significant impact beyond telomere maintenance,
affecting snoRNA accumulation [50], the DNA damage response
[51] and IRES-mediated translation [52].
No significant differences were observed in clinical presentation
of patients with TERC and TERT mutations in our cohort. This is
despite the fact that as a group, the TERC mutations gave lower
residual telomerase activity than TERT mutations in the in vitro
TRAP assay. No equivalent comparison has been made previously
although a trend toward higher residual TRAP activity of TERT
mutations has been apparent in other studies [26,30,32]. In the
largest series of TERT mutations published to date [37], the mean
age of 134 carriers was 51 years; 50% of these heterozygotes had
pulmonary disease but only 16% had haematological abnormal-
ities. This highlights the variable penetrance as well as the diverse
and heterogeneous nature of the disease caused by TERT
mutations. A similar spectrum of disease severity can be observed
in families with TERC mutations, although these appear more
likely to present with haematological abnormalities than pulmo-
nary disease. Nevertheless, the disease seen in patients with both
TERC and TERT mutations clearly contrasts dramatically with the
severe early onset of DC, the HH syndrome, and/or AA that can
be seen in patients with mutations in either the shelterin
component, TINF2 or the snoRNP component, DKC1.
It is interesting to consider how the rate of telomere shortening
differs between the genetic subtypes, even though this is very
difficult to measure empirically in individual patients. However, in
a typical patient with a TINF2 mutation (e.g. the recurrent
Arg282His substitution), this will have arisen de novo and
presentation, with very short telomeres occurs in the early years
of life. A similar rapid shortening of telomeres will have occurred
in approximately 1/3 of patients with DKC1 mutations (e.g. the
recurrent Ala353Val substitution) in which the mutation will also
have occurred de novo; in patients that inherit a DKC1 mutation,
they do so from an asymptomatic heterozygous mother, who will
show a highly skewed pattern of X-inactivation in peripheral
blood. Both situations are completely different to the typical
presentation of TERC and TERT mutations which, although
dominant, are usually present in the family for at least one
asymptomatic generation. The rate of telomere shortening here
appears to be much slower, with critically short telomeres
manifesting in disease at an older age and after transmission
through the germ line.
One confounding factor in the comparison of different
mutations within and between genetic subtypes is the diversity of
the mutations themselves. Some mutations are clearly and
recognizably pathogenic because they recur (such as Ala353Val
in DKC1 and Arg282His in TINF2) or because they abolish
telomerase activity (as seen in TERC and TERT). However with
private missense mutations in DKC1 and TINF2 or with mutations
that only partially reduce telomerase activity in TERC and TERT,
it is more difficult to be sure that they are disease causing, rather
than bystander mutations.
The significant clinical differences observed between the genetic
subgroups (such as the early onset of disease and greater number
of disease features in DKC1 and TINF2 patients compared to
TERC and TERT patients and the higher incidence of cancer in
patients with TERC mutations) will facilitate more informed
decisions in the clinic. Equally these findings serve to highlight that
whilst these genetic subtypes are unified by having a defect in
telomere biology (the ‘‘telomereopathies’’) the clear differences
they exhibit suggest other factors (inherited and acquired)
contribute to the overall clinical phenotype. Finally, as a major
subgroup of the novel mutations were observed in patients who did
not fulfil the criteria to be classified as DC, this study highlights the
importance of screening the telomerase and shelterin genes in
patients with a spectrum of clinical phenotypes in addition to DC.
Methods
Subjects
All individuals included in this study have given written
informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and our study design, approved by the East London and The City
Research Ethics Committee. The novel mutations reported in this
study were identified among 732 patients referred to our registry
over a period of 69 months. They comprised 318 patients with AA,
99 patients who had AA in combination with a family history and/
or other somatic disease features (constitutional AA), 81 patients
with MDS, 123 patients who had features overlapping those of
DC, but insufficient for a clinical diagnosis to be made and 111
who were classified as having DC on clinical grounds. The latter
were defined as having either (i) the diagnostic triad of
mucocutaneous features, or (ii) 1 or more of these features
combined with a hypoplastic bone marrow and at least 2 other
features known to occur in DC, or (iii) at least 4 of the 6 features
commonly associated with the HH syndrome (intrauterine growth
retardation, developmental delay, microcephaly, cerebellar hypo-
plasia, immunodeficiency and bone marrow failure). From this
same group of patients we have previously reported on 4 families
with MDS/AML and mutations in TERC or TERT [53], as well as
33 families with mutations in the TINF2 gene [39,42] and have
also identified 14 families with recurrent DKC1 mutations and 3
families with recurrent TERC mutations.
Mutation analysis
Genes were scanned for mutation as previously described [43].
Briefly, fragments encompassing all coding exons and flanking
intronic sequences of each gene were amplified from genomic
DNA by PCR. These fragments were then subjected to denaturing
HPLC analysis (in the presence of equal amounts of wild-type
DNA fragments in the case of the X-linked DKC1 gene). Where
abnormal patterns of elution were identified, the fragments were
re-amplified and sequenced directly using the BigDyeTM
chain
termination method and a 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied
Biosystems).
Telomere length measurement
Telomere terminal restriction fragment lengths were deter-
mined by Southern blot analysis using the sub-telomeric probe
pTelBam8 in DNA extracted from total peripheral blood white
cells, as previously described [16]. Age adjusted lengths (Dtel) for
any one individual were determined by subtracting the expected
telomere length, obtained from a regression line drawn from 176
healthy controls, from the observed telomere length as described
[54].
We have also used a monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR
method to measure telomere length [55] in which the amount of
telomeric DNA (T) and the amount of a single copy gene (S) are
quantified using standard curves established by titration of a
reference genomic DNA sample. All samples were measured in
triplicate. T/S ratios, which are proportional to the telomere

length [55], were then normalised against a second reference DNA
sample that was run on every plate. We have adapted the method
for use on a LightCycler 480 real time thermocycler (Roche) as
described previously [21].
Telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay
The TRAP assay was performed as previously described [53].
Briefly, mutations identified in the TERC or TERT genes were
introduced into plasmids harbouring the wild-type gene using a
QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids
were then transfected into WI-38 VA13 cells and after 48 hours
the telomerase activity was measured using the TRAPeze RT
Telomerase Detection Kit (Millipore/Chemicon).
Statistical methods
Student’s t-tests were performed in ExCel and the Pearson’s chi-
squred test was performed using VassarStats (http://faculty.vassar.
edu/lowry/VassarStats.html).
