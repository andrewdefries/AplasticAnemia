Agricultural Exposures and Cancer
Trends in Developed Countries
Devra Lee Davis,' Aaron Blair,2 and David G. Hoel3
Recent increases have been reported in industrial countries for several sites ofcancer. Thecauses ofthese increases remain
unknown. Efforts should proceed to identify those occupational groups with increases inthe same sites, as these may in-
dicate relevant exposures. Twoanalyses were undertaken: trends in cancer mortality in industrial countries were reviewed
to identify recently increasing sites and summaries werecompiledofstudies on farmers whichhave shown increased risks
for these same sites ofcancer. Using data provided by the World Health Organization, age-specific rates were developed
for a number ofsites ofcancerfrom 1968 to 1986. Trends in the ratio ofmale to female cancermortality were also assess-
ed for several ofthese countries. Based on a literature review by the National Cancer Institute, patterns ofcancer in farmers
reported in 20studies from 8countries are summarized, weighting each study by its sizetocreatecombined relative risks.
In industrial countries, rates of cancer mortality increased for a number ofsites, including melanoma, prostate, non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast, brain, and kidney cancer. The ratioofmale to femalecancer mortali-
ty (for all sites ofcancer exduding lung) has generally increased in several countries during this same time period. Many
ofthe same sites that have increased in the general population have also been found to be increasing in farmers. Signifi-
cant excesses occurred forHodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, leukemia, skinmelanomas, andcancers ofthelip, stomach,
and prostate. Nonsignificant increases in risk were also noted for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and cancers ofconnective
tissue and brain in many surveys. These excesses occurred against a background ofsubstantial deficits among farmers
fortotal mortality, heart disease, and many otherspecific diseases. Epidemiologic studies offarmers, and other occupa-
tional groups with excess ratesofthese same sites ofcancer, may help to identify specific causal exposures that partly ac-
count for the rising trend ofcertain cancers in developed countries. Despite a number ofcommon causes, heart disease
andsomesites ofcancer showopposite trendsinthe general population, with theformerdecreasingandthelatterincreasing.
Thus, the causes ofthe increases incancer are not likely to stem from those that are shared with heart disease, but to repre-
sent some as-yet-unrecognized risk factors. Among those that should be carefully reviewed are solvents, pesticides, engine
exhausts, and animal viruses, materials to which both farmers and the general population are exposed in increasing
amounts.
Introduction
Much ofcancer is believed to be preventable because rates vary
substantially between populations. Environmental factors,
broadly conceived, are likely to account for much ofthis varia-
tion. Trends in cancer rates are, therefore, often used to provide
indications ofthe diminution or increase in environmental fac-
tors that might be contributing to the cancer burden. A series of
studies have reported increasing rates for a number ofcancers in
industrial countries (1-3). Factors contributing to the rising rates
for several ofthese cancers have not been identified. Studies of
cancer among farmers, however, may provide clues (4). This
paper briefly reviews the pattern ofincreasing cancer rates in the
general population, provides some speculations about the causes
that might be involved, and suggests a research approach that
might identify relevant environmental factors.

Methods
Cancer rates were evaluated using data from the World Health
Organization. Time trends were calculated using simple normal
theory linear regression analysis applied to yearly age-specific
cancer mortality rates.
For the analysis ofcancer among farmers, data on cancer and
other causes of death from 21 broad occupational surveys had
previously been assembled from 8 industrial countries (4). In
these surveys, the riskofcancer among farmers wasusually com-
pared with the risk in the general population. Inclusionofsurveys
which systematically provided cancer risks on many occupations
reduced the potential for a bias toward reporting positive find-
ings. Observed and expected numbers for various causes ofdeath
were added across the studies to create combined relative risks
(CRRs) to minimize the influence of unusual chance findings
from individual studies on the overall interpretation. Statistical
significance for the CRRs was evaluated using 95 % confidence
intervals (CI) (5). This procedure weights the contribution of
each study by its size. We also determined for each cancer the
range in relative risks, the number ofstudies where the relative
risk exceeded unity, and number of statistically significant ex-
cesses to evaluate the distribution andconsistency ofindividual
riskestimates. This approach weights individual studies equally.

skin (ICD 172), and cancers ofthe brain (ICD 191-192) and pros-
tate (ICD 185) increased significantly in six industrial countries
among persons ages 64 to 84 from 1969 to 1986 (1,3). Tables 1-5
show the annual percentage change forthese sites for specific 10-
year age groups and the age-adjusted rate for thoseages 45-84,
adjusted to the populationdistribution in the United States. Data
for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were analyzed only for U.S. inci-
dence and U.K. mortality.
For those sites on which data were compared in all six coun-
tries, brain cancer mortality showed the greatest rate ofincrease
in every country in all age groups, excepting those under age 65
in the United States. Forthis same timeperiod, braincancer mor-
tality increased at least 50% for persons over age 64 in all coun-
tries, except those under age 75 in the United States. Mortality
from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma increased at an even greater rate
in theU.K. atall agegroups. U.S. incidence forthissite increased
at all age groups at slightly lower rates than those ofthe U.K.,
with the greatest increases occurring in the oldest age groups.
Increases in mortality from multiple myeloma, melanoma of
the skin, andprostate cancer increased significantly in most age
groups throughout this same time period. While the rate of in-
crease was great for melanoma and multiple myeloma, these
diseases remain relatively rare in all countries. In contrast, pro-
state cancer is a common, but increasing, cause ofdeaths in all
countries, especially in older men. Rates in France for men ages
65-84 are about40% higherthan those in the U.K. and five times
those in Japan.
Figure 1 shows that in the United States, Japan, England,
France, Italy, and WestGermany the ratioofthe age-adjusted rate
ofmale to female cancer mortality (forall causes excluding lung)
increased significantly from 1969 to 1986. This increase was not
seen with lung cancer dueprimarily to increasing rates ofsmok-
ing and subsequent lung cancer among women in several coun-
tries (Fig. 2).

Table 6 displays summary data from20 different occupational
surveys that included farmers. Most studies surveyed only white
men, but a few also included women and/or minorities.
Statistically significant deficits in the CRRs occurred for all
causes combined, ischemic heart disease, all cancer combined,
as well as for cancers of the lung, esophagus, bladder, colon,
liver, and kidney. In contrast, significantly increased CRRs oc-
curred for Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, leukemia,
melanoma ofthe skin and cancers ofthe lip, stomach, and pro-
state. These excesses were small and some individual studies
showed deficits. Although the CRRs for non-Hodgkin's lym-
phoma and cancers ofthe connective tissue and brain were not
significantly elevated, they tended to be increased in most
studies.
Discussion
Multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma of
the skin, and cancers ofthe lung, prostate, bladder, brain, and
breast are increasing in the general population of several in-
dustrial countries. The rates ofincrease are remarkably similar
between countries and occur in both sexes. Mortality increases
are greatest inthose over age 74, butarealso evident in thoseover
age 54. For all ofthese sites except breast, men have highermor-
tality than women. In general, the malerates are increasing faster
than those among women. In the U.S. SEER system, incidence
is also increasing for a number ofthese same sites (2,6). Some
researchers have suggested that most ofthese increases may be
artificial resulting from improvements in health care and diag-
nosis (7), butothers have concluded that these factors are unlike-
ly to explain all ofthe increase (1).
There are few clues as to whatenvironmental factors may con-
tribute to the rising rates, although any ofthe established risk fac-
tors are potential candidates. Heart disease shares a number of
etiologic factors with cancer, including cigarette smoking, heavy
alcohol use, and diets high in fat and low in fiber and antiox-
idants. Rates for heart disease in several developed countries,
however, are declining (8). In the United States rates have declin-
ed almost 40% since the peak in the late 1960s. Ittherefore seems
unlikely that the causes ofthe recent increases in some sites of
cancer would be due to those etiologic factors shared with heart
disease. Ifenvironmental factors are involved, otherexplanations
are needed. The focus should be on factors that have been in-
creasing among the general population in prevalence and/or ex-
posure level. HIV is now contributing significantly to increases
in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (9), but itcannot providethe entire
explanation because the rising trend started before the AIDS
epidemic. One clue for factors that might contribute to the ris-
ing rates comes from studies offarmers.
Several ofthetumors thatare increasing indevelopedcountries
have been found to be elevated among farmers (10-12). The ex-
cesses for specific cancers among farmers occur against a
backgroundoflow overall risks for total mortality, heart disease,
and several cancers including lung, esophagus, colon, andblad-
der. These relatively reduced rates may be due to the low
prevalence of smoking observed globally among farmers
(13-18), their greater levels ofphysical activity (19-23), and
perhaps diets that are higher in fiber and lower in refined
products.
The cancer excesses among farmers may have broad public
health implications, since several appear to be increasing in the
general population ofmany developed countries (1,3), including
multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma ofthe
skin, and cancers ofthe prostate and brain. Factors responsible
for the high rates among farmers may also be contributing to ris-
ing rates in the general population. A number ofetiologic clues
to farming-related canceralready exist (11). Because ofthe out-
door nature oftheir work, farmers have considerable exposure
to ultraviolet light, the major risk factor for melanoma (24). Ex-
posure to pesticides, particularly phenoxyacetic acid herbicides,
has been linked to increased risks fornon-Hodgkin's lymphoma
(25-28), although excesses have not been observed in some
studies (29). Farmers who work with some insecticides have
been found to have elevated rates ofleukemia (30,31), multiple
myeloma (32,33), and brain cancer (34). Although use of fer-
tilizers has not been evaluated in relation to cancer among
farmers, environmental exposures to nitrates have been associ-
ated with stomach cancer in epidemiologic and experimental in-
vestigations (35). The increasing contamination of drinking
water sources with nitrates in many rural areas makes this an
issue of special concern (36). A study of Canadian farmers
detected an association between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and
expenditures on fuels (37), suggesting thatexposures to fuels or
engine exhausts may play an etiologic role. Other agricultural ex-
posures including animal viruses, mycotoxins, dusts, and sol-
vents have yet to be carefully evaluated. Many agricultural ex-
posures havebecome more common among the general popula-
tion in recentyears. For example, pollution from engine exhausts
has increased, and pesticides and fertilizers are now widely used
in urban areas.
The tumors with rising rates in the general population and ex-
cessive among farmers display no obvious commonality. They
are blood tumors and solid cancers from the reproductive, ner-
vous, and digestive systems. They include common (prostate)
and less common tumors (multiple myeloma). Studies of im-
munodeficiencies may provide a mechanistic link. Patients with
naturally occurring or medically induced immunodeficiencies
experience striking excesses of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
(38-43). In addition, leukemia and stomach cancer appear
among persons with primary immunodeficiency syndromes,
melanoma and lip cancer among renal transplant recipients
(41,42), and brain cancer among bone marrow recipients (43).
This similarity between cancers associated with immunosup-
pression and cancers displaying rising rates and highrates among
farmers suggests thatenvironmental factors may beinvolved that
operate through immunologic perturbations that remain to be
identified (4).
Pesticides, which may contribute to cancer excesses among
farmers, may operate through genetic and epigenitic mecha-
nisms. The mechanismsofaction, however, are obscure. Some
pesticides appear to be genotoxic. Garrettet al. (44) evaluated of
genetic damage from 65 pesticides in 14 in vivo and in vitro tests:
9 were active in most tests, 26 were active in several tests, and 30
were inactive in all tests. Pesticides may operate through
epigenetic pathways, including the immune system. In ex-
perimental studies, pesticides have been linked to a variety ofim-
mune defects including decreased host resistance to infection,
thymus atrophy, reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity response,
42
AGRICULTURAL EXPOSURESAND CANCER TRENDS 43
suppressed T-cell activity, enhanced B- and T-cell immune
response, and contact hypersensitivity (45). Pesticides could af-
fect a variety of cancers through an immunologic mechanism.
Laboratory and epidemiologic investigations to evaluate such a
link could help clarify the high rates among farmers and rising
rates among the general public.
The best evidence to date regarding carcinogenic exposures
among farmers derives chiefly from case-control interview
studies. The retrospective nature ofexposure assessment in these
investigations, however, undoubtedly results in exposure
misclassification (23). Such misclassification is likely to be non-
directional and would tend to diminish risk estimates and dilute
exposure-response gradients (46). Because farmers are indepen-
dent operators who direcdy order, pay for, and applythe material
with which they work, they can often provide considerably more
detail about their work practices and chemical exposures than
workers in other industries. Still, the opportunity for recall
because ofthe passage oftime, infrequent use, or changing pat-
terns of use of agricultural chemicals suggests that exposure
assessment based entirely on recall would suffer, and true
associations could be missed. Studies with improved exposure
assessment approaches are needed. Prospective studies of
farmers that incorporate environmental and biologic measures
ofexposure with data from interviews could improve the preci-
sion of exposure assessment. Inclusion of spouses and depen-
dents in such studies would provide information on cancer risk
from indirectexposure tovarious agricultural chemicals and thus
provide an indication of whether these exposures could con-
tribute to the rising rates for certain cancers in the general
population.
In summary, several tumors including multiple myeloma, non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma, melanoma ofthe skin, and cancers ofthe
brain, prostate, lung, and breast appear to be increasing in many
developed countries. Explanations for most of these are not
available. Studies of farmers may provide a clue. Despite low
risks for most major causes ofdeath, firmers tend to be athigher
risk than thegeneral population for anumber oftypes ofcancer
including multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, leu-
kemia, melanoma ofthe skin, and cancers ofthe lip, brain, pro-
state, and stomach. These tumors among farmers show con-
siderable overlap with those displaying rising rates in the general
population. The occurrence of several ofthese cancers among
patients with naturally occurring and medically induced im-
munosuppression suggests that the rising rates among the general
public and high rates among farmers may be due to factors that
affect the immune system. Studies to evaluate the influence of
agricultural chemicals on the immune system are needed to
follow-up this lead.
