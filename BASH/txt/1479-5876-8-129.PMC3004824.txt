Abstract
Background: Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are typically differentiated in vitro with interferon (IFN)-g and aCD3
monoclonal antibodies (mAb), followed by the repeated provision of interleukin (IL)-2. It is presently unknown
whether thymoglobulin (TG), a preparation of polyclonal rabbit g immunoglobulins directed against human
thymocytes, can improve the generation efficiency of CIK cells compared with aCD3 mAb in a clinical-grade
culture protocol.
Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 10 healthy donors and 4 patients with solid cancer
were primed with IFN-g on day 0 and low (50 ng/ml), intermediate (250 ng/ml) and high (500 ng/ml)
concentrations of either aCD3 mAb or TG on day 1, and were fed with IL-2 every 3 days for 21 days. Aliquots of
cells were harvested weekly to monitor the expression of representative members of the killer-like immunoglobulin
receptor (KIR), NK inhibitory receptor, NK activating receptor and NK triggering receptor families. We also quantified
the frequency of bona fide regulatory T cells (Treg), a T-cell subset implicated in the down-regulation of anti-tumor
immunity, and tested the in vitro cytotoxic activity of CIK cells against NK-sensitive, chronic myeloid leukaemia K562
cells.
Results: CIK cells expanded more vigorously in cultures supplemented with intermediate and high concentrations
of TG compared with 50 ng/ml aCD3 mAb. TG-driven CIK cells expressed a constellation of NK activating/inhibitory
receptors, such as CD158a and CD158b, NKp46, NKG2D and NKG2A/CD94, released high quantities of IL-12p40 and
efficiently lysed K562 target cells. Of interest, the frequency of Treg cells was lower at any time-point compared
with PBMC cultures nurtured with aCD3 mAb. Cancer patient-derived CIK cells were also expanded after priming
with TG, but they expressed lower levels of the NKp46 triggering receptor and NKG2D activating receptor, thus
manifesting a reduced ability to lyse K562 cells.
Conclusions: TG fosters the generation of functional CIK cells with no concomitant expansion of tumor-
suppressive Treg cells. The culture conditions described herein should be applicable to cancer-bearing individuals,
although the differentiation of fully functional CIK cells may be hindered in patients with advanced malignancies.
Introduction
Adoptive cellular immunotherapy aims at restoring
tumour-cell recognition by the immune system, leading
to effective tumour cell killing. A major hurdle to the
successful immunotherapy of cancer is represented by
the difficulty in generating clinically relevant numbers of
immune effector cells with potent in vivo anti-tumour
activity, especially in heavily pre-treated patients. To
date, various populations of cytotoxic effector cells have
been expanded using robust cell culture procedures and
have been administered in a variety of human cancers.
Host effector cells endowed with killing activity against
tumour cells were initially described in the early 1980s
as lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells [1,2]. The

LAK cell population is heterogeneous, being comprised
of CD3-
CD56+
NK cells, CD3+
CD56+
MHC-unrestricted
cytotoxic T cells and CD3+
CD56-
T cells. Over the
years, improvements in culture conditions, such as the
addition of aCD3 (OKT3) monoclonal antibody (mAb)
at the initiation of culture and the provision of cytokines
at the end of culture, translated into better expansion of
LAK cells. Current protocols to differentiate cytokine-
induced killer (CIK) cells are based on a combination of
1,000 IU/ml interferon (IFN)-g on day 1 of culture, fol-
lowed 24 hours later by OKT3 at 50 ng/ml and interleu-
kin (IL)-2 at 300 IU/ml [3]. At the end of the 21-28 day
culture period, CD3+
CD56+
cells, derived from
CD3+
CD56-
cells, acquire cytotoxicity against various
tumour cell targets, including acute myeloid leukaemia
(AML), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), B and T-cell
lymphoma. The expression of CD56 on CIK cells is
thought to result from IFN-g priming with IL-12 pro-
duction from monocytes. CIK cells share phenotypic
and functional properties of both T cells and NK cells,
insofar they express CD3 and are rapidly expandable in
culture like T cells, while not necessitating functional
priming for in vivo activity like NK cells. Interestingly,
CIK cells do not recognize target cells through the T-
cell receptor (TCR) and do not require the presence of
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on
target cells, as suggested by the observation that cyto-
toxicity is not affected by antibody masking of the TCR
or MHC class I or class II molecules [4]. Cytotoxicity by
CIK cells does not rely on antibody-dependent cell cyto-
toxicity (ADCC) mechanisms, given the absence of
CD16 on their surface membrane, and is not inhibited
by the immune suppressive drugs cyclosporine A and
FK506 [5]. Conversely, the anti-tumour activity of CIK
cells mainly relies on the engagement of NK Group 2,
member D (NKG2D) by NKG2D ligands on tumour
cells, and on perforin-mediated pathways [6].
The in vivo activity of CIK cells was initially demon-
strated in a murine SCID/human lymphoma model,
where the co-administration of CIK cells with B lym-
phoma cells exerted a favorable effect on mice survival,
with a 1.5-2-log cell kill and minimal toxicity against
normal hematopoietic precursors [4]. CIK cells were
subsequently shown to protect against syngeneic and
allogeneic tumors in other experimental models, includ-
ing nude mice xenografted with human cervical carci-
noma cells [7-9]. An international registry (IRCC) has
been recently established with the aim to report results
from current clinical trials using CIK cells, either as
such or additionally manipulated [10]. Eleven clinical
trials with autologous or allogeneic CIK cells were iden-
tified, with 426 patients enrolled. Most trials included
male patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric
cancer and relapsed lymphoma [11,12]. A clinical
response was reported in 384 patients who received up
to 40 infusions of CIK cells. The total response rate was
24% and a decrease of tumour volume was documented
in 3 patients. However, disease-free survival rates were
significantly higher in patients treated with CIK cells
than in a control group without CIK treatment.
Thymoglobulin® (TG) is a purified, pasteurized pre-
paration of polyclonal g immunoglobulin raised in rab-
bits against human thymocytes [13]. TG is currently
indicated for the prevention and/or treatment of renal
transplant rejection, and displays specificity towards a
wide variety of surface antigens on both immune system
and endothelial cells. The precise mechanism(s) of
action underlying its immunosuppressive efficacy are
unclear, although T-cell depletion is considered to play
a prominent role. Other mechanisms include lympho-
cyte surface antigen modulation, transcription factor
activation, and interference with processes of immune
system cells, such as cytokine production, chemotaxis,
endocytosis, stimulation and proliferation (reviewed in
ref. [13]). TG may also induce apoptosis, antibody-
dependent lysis or complement-mediated lysis of various
immune system cells, thus negating leukocyte-endothe-
lial cell adhesion. Intriguingly, anti-lymphocyte globulin
therapy in patients with aplastic anemia enhanced the
function of MHC-unrestricted lymphocytes [14]. It is
presently unknown whether TG can expand CIK cells
more efficiently than aCD3 mAb in clinical-grade
cultures.
We report herein the results of an in vitro study
where TG was confronted with aCD3 mAb for its abil-
ity to promote the expansion and acquisition of cyto-
toxicity by CIK cells. We show that TG amplifies the
number of CIK cells with greater efficiency than aCD3
after 21 days in culture. CIK cells generated in this fash-
ion express a constellation of NK cell-associated inhibi-
tory/activating receptors, release considerable amounts
of IL-12p40 and lyse the NK-sensitive K562 cell line.
The above culture conditions were also applied to
PBMC from heavily pre-treated cancer patients, to
ascertain whether TG can be a candidate drug for the
optimization of CIK expansion protocols in preparation
for clinical trials.
Materials and methods
Generation of CIK cells
CIK cells were generated under good manufacturing
practice (GMP) conditions. Peripheral blood samples
were obtained by phlebotomy in 10 consented healthy
donors (median age 45 years; range, 22-58 years) and by
steady-state apheresis in 4 patients with advanced cervi-
cal cancer (n = 3) or melanoma (n = 1). The patients’
characteristics are listed in Table 1. The investigations
were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee

tocol ID: P/757/CE/2009).
Peripheral blood samples collected by venipuncture
were layered over Ficoll-Paque® (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences; Milan, Italy) and peripheral blood mononuc-
lear cells (PBMC) were separated by centrifugation at
1,400 rpm for 30 minutes, as already detailed [15]. After
washings with PBS, PBMC were grown in serum-free
medium (X-VIVO 10; Bio-Whittaker Europe, Belgium)
supplemented with 80 mg/L gentamycin (Schering
Plough, Milan, Italy) and incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. Cells were seeded at 2.0 × 106
cells/ml in
25 cm2
cell culture flasks (Corning, NY 14831, USA).
On day 0, cells were activated with recombinant human
IFN-g (1,000 IU/ml; Imukin®, Boehringer Ingelheim,
Ingelheim, Germany). The following day, cells were sti-
mulated with either aCD3 mAb (UCHT1 clone; 50-500
ng/ml, BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) or Thymoglobu-
lin® (50-500 ng/ml, Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA)
and recombinant human IL-2 (rHuIL-2, 300 IU/ml; Pro-
leukin®, Novartis Pharma, Milan, Italy). Cell suspensions
were maintained in subculture with fresh medium sup-
plemented with rHuIL-2 every 3 days for 3 weeks. For
quality control, aliquots of cells were harvested weekly
and used for automatic cell counting, phenotypic analy-
sis, and microbiologic testing. Cell viability was evalu-
ated at the end of the culture period by flow cytometry,
after labeling with 7-amino-actinomycin-D (7-AAD;
Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) [16].
Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence
At baseline (day 0) and after 7, 14 and 21 days in cul-
ture, aliquots of cells were incubated for 30 minutes at
4°C with fluorochrome-conjugated mAb to CD3, CD8,
CD45, CD16+CD56 (BD Multitest™IMK Kit; BD Bios-
ciences, Mountain View, CA), CD94, CD158a
(KIR2DL1), CD158b (KIR2DL2/DL3; BD Biosciences),
NKG2A (KLRC1 or CD159a; R&D Systems, Oxon, UK),
NKp46 (CD335), NKG2D (CD314; Beckman Coulter,
Milan, Italy). Isotype-matched, fluorochrome-conjugated
mAb from the same manufacturers were used to control
for background fluorescence. The intracellular expres-
sion of the FoxP3 transcription factor was detected in
fixed/permeabilized T cells that were initially labeled
with anti-CD4 and anti-CD25 mAb (both from BD Bios-
ciences), followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated rat
anti-human FoxP3 mAb (PCH101 clone; Human Regu-
latory T Cell Staining Kit; eBioscience, San Diego, CA).
Cells were run through a FACS Canto® flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) with standard equipment [17]. Samples
were analyzed with the FACS Diva® software package
(BD Biosciences).
Cytotoxicity assay
After 21 days in culture, aliquots of cells were used for
cytotoxicity assays. Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (CAM)
has been recently developed as an alternative to radioac-
tive 51
Cr release assay [18]. CAM is a lipid-soluble,
non-polar compound that passively crosses the plasma
membrane in living cells, where it is cleaved by intracel-
lular esterases to reveal a very polar derivative of fluor-
escein (calcein) that remains trapped in the cytoplasm.
CAM (Fluka, Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO to
a final concentration of 1 mM and stored in aliquots at
-80°C. K562 target cells (1 × 106
), derived from a patient
suffering from CML in blast crisis, were incubated in X-
VIVO 10 medium in the presence of pre-titrated con-
centrations of CAM (0.1 μM) for 10 minutes at 37°C,
shielded from light. The labeled cells were washed two
times in ice-cold medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), were re-suspended in X-VIVO 10
and then plated in round bottom 96-well plates at 5-10
× 105
cells/well in triplicate. CIK cells were added at the
effector-to-target (E:T) ratios detailed in the Figure
legends, in a final volume of 200 μl, and were incubated
for 4 hours. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS
and re-suspended in 20 μg/ml 7-AAD for 20 minutes at
room temperature, shielded from light, before flow cyto-
metry analysis [19]. 7-AAD is a fluorescent DNA
dye that selectively binds to GC regions of the DNA.

The 7-AAD assay has been used to detect the loss of
membrane integrity during apoptosis of murine thymo-
cytes and human peripheral lymphocytes [20]. Percent

Measurement of IL-12p40
After 21 days, supernatants from CIK cell cultures were
collected and used to quantify IL-12p40 production by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&D Sys-
tems, Oxon, UK), as reported [22]. The limit of detec-
tion was <15 pg/ml IL-12p40.
Statistical analysis
Data distribution was preliminarily tested with kurtosis
and symmetry. Data were presented as median and
inter-quartile range. All comparisons were performed
with the Mann-Whitney or the Wilcoxon signed-rank
tests for paired or unpaired determinations, as appropri-
ate. The criterion for statistical significance was defined
as p < 0.05.
Results
Generation of CIK cells with TG
In a first set of experiments, we determined whether
and to what extent TG promotes the generation of func-
tional CIK cells and other desirable populations of
immune effectors, namely, CD3+
CD8+
T cells and CD3-
CD56+
NK cells, starting from PBMC preparations. To
this end, PBMC from consented volunteer donors were
cultured in the presence of IFN-g, IL-2 and either TG
or aCD3 mAb at low (50 ng/ml), intermediate (250 ng/
ml) or high concentration (500 ng/ml), as schematically
depicted in Figure 1A. Cells were harvested on days +7,
+14 and +21, were counted to calculate fold-expansion
compared with baseline and were used to assess infor-
mative phenotypic features. The percentage of CD3+

concentrations of aCD3 mAb (bottom row).

PBMC sample before culturing is shown in Figure 1B.
When used at intermediate (int
TG) and high concentra-
tion (hi
TG), TG induced a greater expansion of PBMC
compared with equal concentrations of aCD3 mAb, and
the difference was maximal after 14 and 21 days in
culture (Table 2 and Figure 1c). Hi
TG promoted a
46.08-fold expansion of PBMC on day +21, compared
with a median 11.75-fold expansion in the presence of
hi
aCD3 mAb. In contrast, int
aCD3 and hi
aCD3 mAb
failed to further increase PBMC number compared with
low
aCD3 at any time-point in culture (Table 2), likely
reflecting enhanced levels of activation-induced cell
death. As shown in Table 2, both int
TG and hi
TG caused
a greater fold-expansion of PBMC compared with aCD3
mAb at a concentration routinely used to differentiate
CIK cells, i.e., 50 ng/ml.
We next calculated the absolute number and esti-
mated the frequency of CD3+
CD8+
T cells, CD3-
CD16
+
CD56+
(NK cells), and CD3+
CD16+
CD56+
(CIK cells)
in cultures supplemented with aCD3 mAb (Figure 2A;
Figure 3) or TG (Figure 2B; Figure 3). These PBMC cul-
tures started with a typical percentage of approximately
6-9% and 8-12% CD3+
CD56+
T cells and NK cells,
respectively (Figure 1B). After the 21-day culture period,
the median percentages of CIK cells and NK cells in
cultures maintained with hi
aCD3 and hi
TG were 64%
and 9.7%, and 55% and 27.5%, respectively. As expected,
CIK cells were predominantly comprised of CD3+
CD8+
T cells. It should be noted that the percentage of CD3
+
CD8+
T cells at any time-point was consistently higher
in cultures supplemented with TG. This difference was
maximal when comparing CIK cultures at day +7 after
priming with TG or aCD3 mAb, as illustrated in Figure

2A-2B (cumulative data) and in Figure 3 (a representa-
tive experiment out of 10 with similar results). At this
time-point in culture, the increase of aCD3 mAb con-
centration in the medium was associated with a progres-
sive decline in the percentage of CD3+
CD8+
T cells, a
phenomenon that was also evident after 14 and 21 days
(Figure 3). Similarly, NK cells were significantly more
represented within CIK cultures activated with TG
when compared with cultures nurtured with aCD3
mAb. Whereas day-21 CIK cultures contained a median
27.5% NK cells after priming with hi
TG, the fraction of
NK cells was consistently < 10% in CIK cultures acti-
vated with aCD3, irrespective of the mAb concentration
in the culture medium (Figure 3). Taken together, phe-
notypic analyses indicated that the heterogeneous popu-
lation of cells that emerged after 21 days in culture with
TG contained higher numbers of CIK cells and other
immune effectors such as CD8+
T cells and NK cells
compared with those differentiated with aCD3 mAb.
Also, hi
TG was significantly more effective than int
TG
and low
TG at generating the three populations of
immune effector cells.
We next addressed whether TG in combination with
IL-2 favors the concomitant expansion of Treg cells, as
defined by their FoxP3+
phenotype. The rationale for
these experiments stems from a previous report
indicating that high concentrations of TG (10 μg/ml)
up-regulate molecules associated with Treg function on
CD4+
T cells [23]. Even more intriguingly, IL-2, which
is routinely used to generate CIK cells, is a Treg-cell
growth factor both in vitro (reviewed in ref. [24]) and in
vivo [25,26]. As shown in Figure 4A, the cumulative fre-
quency of bona fide Treg cells was lower in cultures
containing TG versus aCD3, suggesting that the clinical
application of TG for the generation of anti-tumor effec-
tor cells is not expected to negatively affect anti-tumor
immunity through Treg cells. A representative experi-
ment aimed at quantifying Treg-cell frequency by flow
cytometry both at baseline and in expanded CIK cul-
tures is illustrated in Figure 4B and 4C. Based on the
above data and to maximize the yield of CIK cells in
culture, TG was consistently used at 250 ng/ml or 500
ng/ml in all subsequent experiments, as detailed in the
Figure legends.
Phenotype and effector functions of in vitro-generated
CIK cells
We proceeded to investigate the expression of triggering
and inhibitory receptors that may modulate cytotoxicity
by the cultured CIK cells. To this end, PBMC were
primed with int
TG or hi
TG and then maintained for 21
days with IL-2 to achieve maximal expansion, followed

by labeling with a panel of mAb recognizing the NK
activating receptor NKG2D, the NK triggering receptor
NKp46, the NK inhibitory receptor CD94-NKG2A and
two representative members of the KIR family
(KIR2DL1 or CD158a and KIR2DL2/DL3 or CD158b).
The phenotypic features of CIK cells generated with TG
were compared with those of CIK cells emerging from
PBMC cultures containing low
aCD3, a standard culture
protocol for CIK cells [27]. Cells were initially gated
based on their expression of CD3. Data shown in Figure
5 are representative of the co-expression of CD56 and
the antigens of interest on CD3+
T cells harvested from
the PBMC cultures at day +21. Hi
TG induced signifi-
cantly higher levels of KIR on the expanded CIK cells,
when compared with either int
TG or low
aCD3 mAb
(Figure 5A). Similarly, the NKG2A/CD94 heterodimer,
the NKp46 triggering receptor and the NKG2D activat-
ing receptor were preferentially up-regulated on CIK
cells differentiated with hi
TG compared with the other
culture conditions herein established (Figure 5).
A further set of experiments was devoted to the analy-
sis of CIK cell cytotoxicity against the NK-sensitive
K562 target cells, taking advantage of a non-radioactive,
flow cytometry-based assay. K562 cells were loaded with
the fluorescent probe CAM and then co-cultured with
escalating numbers of CIK cells, as detailed in Materials
and Methods. Cells emerging from the co-cultures were
gated based on CAM fluorescence and then visualized
on a CAM/7-AAD contour plot to enumerate CAM+
7-
AAD+
dead targets (Figure 6A). In accordance with phe-
notypic data showing a higher expression of NK effector
molecules on cells harvested from TG-driven cultures,
CIK cells differentiated with int
TG and hi
TG lysed K562
cells more efficiently than CIK cells generated with low-
aCD3 mAb (Figure 6B). The cytotoxicity of CIK cells
cultured under hi
TG was maximal at an E:T ratio of 10.
It should be noted that the difference in cytotoxic
potential of CIK cells expanded by hi
TG was most pro-
nounced at an E:T ratio of 5, where specific lysis aver-
aged 60% compared with <30% under the other culture
conditions (p < 0.01; Figure 6B). These observations
suggest that a higher frequency of cytotoxic cells was
present within the population of PBMC expanded with
hi
TG compared with either int/low
TG or low
aCD3 mAb.

IL-12 is a T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine that aug-
ments NK-cell proliferation in vitro and enhances their
cytotoxicity in vivo [28]. The expression of IL-12p40
subunit is known to be restricted to cells that produce
the biologically active IL-12 heterodimer [29]. As shown
in Figure 6C, IL-12p40 levels were significantly higher in
day 21-cultures differentiated with hi
TG compared with
either lower doses of TG or aCD3 mAb. Taken
together, these experiments suggest that hi
TG-differen-
tiated CIK cells may be particularly suitable for adoptive
immunotherapy approaches to cancer.
Generation and function of CIK cells from cancer patients
In view of the promising results obtained when challen-
ging PBMC from healthy donors with hi
TG, we evalu-
ated whether the generation of CIK cells from cancer
patient-derived PBMC could be successfully pursued
under the same experimental conditions (priming with
IFN-g on day 0 and then with IL-2 and TG on day +1).
Figure 7A depicts the average number of PBMC, CD8+
T cells, NK cells and CIK cells in 4 experiments per-
formed with PBMC from 4 patients with cervical cancer
or melanoma. Hi
TG induced a vigorous expansion of
PBMC, CD8+
T cells and CIK cells, but not NK cells,
peaking after 21 days in culture (Figure 7A). It should
be pointed out that the average number of NK cells dif-
ferentiated from patient PBMC was lower compared
with donor PBMC at any time-point. Nevertheless, these
data suggest that TG can generate clinically relevant
numbers of CIK cells in cancer-bearing patients. Table 3
summarizes the frequency of all types of effector cells
that were differentiated from patients’ PBMC after 21
days in culture. The frequency of CD8+
T cells, NK cells
and CIK cells at baseline and after 7, 14 and 21 days in
culture in a representative experiment is shown Figure
7B. As depicted in Figure 7C and in line with our find-
ings with PBMC from healthy volunteers, the percentage
of bona fide Treg cells was significantly lower after cul-
turing with any concentration of TG for 21 days com-
pared with the frequency measured in patients’
peripheral blood, indicating in vitro depletion of pre-
existing Treg cells. The higher percentage of Treg cells
routinely detected in baseline peripheral blood samples
was not unexpected, based on previously published data
on the expansion of the Treg compartment in cancer
patients [30]. Importantly, patient-derived CIK cells
expressed lower levels of KIR, NKG2A, NKG2D and
NKp46 compared with CIK cells differentiated from
normal donors (Figure 7D). Functional assays are indivi-
dually shown in Figure 8A and indicated that in vitro
K562 cell lysis by CIK cells was highly efficient in 2 out
of 4 cases here examined (patients #2 and #3), especially
when CIK cells were plated at a relatively high E:T ratio.
The cytotoxicity experiments performed with CIK cells
from the 4 patients enrolled in the present study have
been summarized in Figure 8B. Both patients whose

CIK cells were capable of lysing K562 cells in vitro were
affected by cervical carcinoma, but had been heavily
pre-treated and had advanced, metastatic disease at
study enrolment (Table 1). No obvious differences in
terms of white blood cell and lymphocyte count at base-
line (day 0, i.e., at time of leukapheresis) were evident
when comparing patients #2 and #3 with the 2 patients
(#1 and #4) showing poor in vitro cytolytic responses
(Table 1), suggesting that qualitative rather than quanti-
tative determinants likely accounted for the observed
phenomena. It should be noted that CIK cultures from
patient #3 were particularly heterogeneous and
contained a relatively high percentage of bona fide NK
cells with a classical CD3-
CD56+
phenotype.
Discussion
The present study aimed at dissecting the role of TG in
the differentiation of CIK cells, a heterogeneous popula-
tion of immune effector cells sharing T-cell and NK-cell
characteristics. The relationship between in vivo circu-
lating CD3+
CD56+
T cells and in vitro-generated CIK
cells is poorly understood. Human CD3+

characterized human NK antigen-expressing CD3+
T-
cell subset is represented by CD56+
T cells that account
for ~5% of peripheral blood T cells. CD56+
T cells lyse
NK-sensitive target cell lines in vitro, can be selectively
expanded by IL-2 and IL-15, but require cell activation
to trigger the secretion of effector cytokines such as
IFN-g and TNF-a. It has been recently shown that CIK
cells expanded with IFN-g, OKT3 and IL-2 resemble
activated effector-memory CD8+
T cells and likely
derive from CD56-
T cells, as suggested by gene expres-
sion profiling [32]. In this respect, only 50 differentially
expressed genes were identified when comparing CIK
cells and CD56-
T cells, whereas 115 genes were either
up-regulated or down-regulated in CIK cells compared
with CD56-
T cells [32]. Collectively, it is now

recognized that CIK cells have undisputed advantages
over other cell therapy products that make them parti-
cularly attractive, such as ease of in vitro expansion,
superior in vivo activity than LAK cells, and no need for
exogenous administration of IL-2 for in vivo priming
[33,34]. Current laboratory protocols dictate that CIK
cells should be differentiated with IFN-g and the OKT3
mAb to CD3, followed by repeated additions of IL-2 for
a maximum of 21-28 days [3,11,12,33].
Our interest in TG as a candidate drug to expand CIK
cells in preparation for clinical trials originated from
reports indicating that binding of TG to CD16, CD18
and NKp46 on NK cells potentiates their activation and
degranulation, and enhances IFN-g production, although
this translated into the decrease of NK cytotoxicity
against K562 cells [35]. When selecting the optimal TG
concentration to be used in culture, we took advantage of
previously published papers showing the following
points. First, TG may induce ~ 15% NK cell apoptosis in
vitro, when added at concentrations ranging from 1 μg/
ml to 100 μg/ml [35,36]. Second, TG directly affects CD4
+
T-cell function and cytokine release when used at 10
μg/ml, transiently up-regulating CD25, FoxP3 and
CTLA-4 mRNA and protein, and increasing IL-2, IL-4,
IL-10 and IFN-g secretion in culture supernatants. Third,
CD4+
T cells pre-treated with 10 μg/ml TG inhibit the
proliferation of autologous CD4+
T cells to allogeneic
PBMC, suggesting the acquisition of a regulatory pheno-
type [23]. We therefore elected to provide TG at rela-
tively low concentrations (from 50 to 500 ng/ml) to the
PBMC cultures, in order to minimize both NK and possi-
bly CIK-cell apoptosis as well as the amplification of
Treg cell numbers. TG significantly expanded PBMC
compared with low
aCD3 mAb, leading to the in vitro

generation of a heterogeneous population comprised of
CD8+
T cells, NK cells and CIK cells. Especially when
used at 500 ng/ml, TG augmented the proliferation of
PBMC with subsequent enhanced generation of CD8+
T
cells, NK and CIK cells, compared both with an equally
high concentration of aCD3 mAb and with low
TG or
int
TG. This implies that hi
TG may be particularly effective
at the concurrent expansion of all three types of immune
effector cells, namely, CD8+
cytotoxic T cells, NK cells
and CIK cells, at variance with aCD3 mAb. Of potential
importance for the design of clinical trials with TG/IL-2-
expanded CIK cells, the frequency of bona fide Treg cells
at any time-point in culture was similar when comparing
PBMC preparations activated with IL-2 and TG or aCD3
mAb, thus reassuring against the infusion of excessive
numbers of tumor-suppressive Treg cells [25].
NK cells express a wide array of inhibitory and activat-
ing receptors such as KIR, NKG2A/CD94, NKG2D,
NKp46 and others, which recognize both foreign and self
antigens expressed by target cells, and finely regulate NK
cytotoxicity against virus-infected and tumor cells [37].
NK receptors play a crucial role in innate immunity
against infections and in anti-tumor immune responses.
It is presently unknown whether TG modulates the
expression of NK receptors on CIK cells, a finding with
important implications for their cytotoxic activity and for
their ability to combat infections. The KIR family consists
of 11 highly polymorphic receptors that are clonally dis-
tributed on NK cells and bind directly to classical MHC
molecules such as particular HLA-Cw alleles. KIR may
be expressed at low levels (i.e., < 10%) on CIK cells differ-
entiated with standard protocols [32]. In our study, both
CD158a (KIR2DL1) and CD158b (KIR2DL2/DL3) were
readily detected on CIK cells expanded with hi
TG, with
expression levels ranging from ~15% to ~65% of CD3
+
CD56+
cells for CD158a and CD158b, respectively.
Although KIR-expressing CD8+
T cells exist in human
peripheral blood [38], the stimuli that regulate KIR
induction in T cells are poorly defined [39], and may
include demethylation events [40]. Interestingly, engage-
ment of CD158b by MHC ligands on human CD8+
effec-
tor T cells hinders TCR signaling and limits T-cell
proliferation [41]. Based on our findings, it is tempting to
speculate that TG provided an in vitro signal orchestrat-
ing the expression of KIR on CIK cells. Conceivably, the
TG-driven expression of KIR might represent a feedback
signal to limit excessive CIK expansion and/or uncon-
trolled in vitro cell death. Although the nature of the sig-
nal(s) delivered to CIK cells through TG remains to be
identified, it is unlikely that cytokine stimuli such as IL-
15 are implicated, based on our observation that IL-15
provision to CIK cultures did not translate into any
further induction of KIR (Rutella S, unpublished observa-
tions, 2010). Our statement is also supported by a
previous report demonstrating the inability of IL-15 and
IL-21 to induce KIR expression on cord blood-derived
NK progenitor cells [42].
NKG2D encodes for a lectin-related protein expressed
as a homodimer and functioning as an activating recep-
tor for ligands often expressed by tumor cells, namely,
class I MHC-related molecules such as MICA, MICB,
and UL16-binding proteins [43]. The NKG2A/CD94
receptor contains C-type lectin ectodomains, binds to
HLA-E, a non-classical MHC protein important for viral
surveillance, and functions as an inhibitory receptor by
signaling through ITIM motifs [44,45]. As recently pro-
posed, high surface levels of NKG2A/CD94 may be
required to avoid excessive NK cell-mediated killing of
HLA-E-bearing normal target cells [45]. Of interest,
CD94/NKG2A expression on CD8+
T cells may protect
from apoptosis and favor the eventual emergence of
memory T-cell responses [46]. In light of these findings,
it is conceivable that high levels of CD94/NKG2A and
KIR on TG-differentiated CIK cells promote cell survi-
val, leading to protection from CIK-mediated killing of
normal cells.
NKp46 belongs to a family of activating natural cyto-
toxicity receptors (NCR) for tumor cells [47], also
including NKp30 and NKp44, that enables a precise
identification of all NK cells. Upon engagement by spe-
cific ligands, NCR induce a strong activation of NK-
mediated cytotoxicity, thus playing a pivotal role in
tumor cell killing [48]. To date, NCR have been detected
on NK cells in a restricted fashion and regardless of
NK-cell activation status. Notably, NKp46 was found on
~15-20% of CD3+
CIK cells differentiated with hi
TG,
and lower expression levels of NKp46 correlated with
lower TG concentrations in the culture medium. These
data are backed by a recent study documenting a 10-
20% expression of NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46 on CIK
cells driven by IFN-g, OKT3 and IL-2 [32]. Overall,
these observations question the specificity of NCR for
cells of the NK lineage and suggest that NCR may also
contribute to the killing activity of CIK cells. When
evaluated for their ability to lyse tumor targets, CIK
effectors differentiated with TG were significantly more
effective at killing K562 cells compared with those nur-
tured with aCD3 mAb. It should be noted that patient-
derived CIK cells expressed lower levels of activating/
inhibitory NK receptors and manifested a reduced lytic
activity in vitro in 2 out of 4 cases. Although the very
small number of patients under study precludes any
sensible conclusion, it is likely that the generation of
fully functional CIK cells by TG was hindered by
immune suppressive circuits in patients with advanced
metastatic disease.
IL-12, a prototype member of a family of IL-12-related
cytokines that includes IL-23 and IL-27, is an instigator

of Th1 immune responses and possesses in vivo anti-
tumor activities [49]. IL-12 is a heterodimer formed by a
35-kDa light chain (known as p35 or IL-12a) and a 40-
kDa heavy chain (known as p40 or IL-12b). Messenger
RNA encoding IL-12p35 is present in many cell types,
whereas mRNA encoding IL-12p40 is restricted to cells
that produce the biologically active heterodimer [29].
Importantly, CIK cells generated with hi
TG released
higher quantities of IL-12p40 compared with the other
culture conditions here established. This finding portends
favorable implications for the use of hi
TG in the genera-
tion of CIK cells, given the established role of IL-12 in
the promotion of anti-tumor immunity [49].
In conclusion, we propose that TG is an attractive drug
to maximize the yield and anti-tumor potency of CIK cell
preparations. The expansion of immune effector cells in
response to a combination of IFN-g, TG and IL-2
occurred in the absence of a significant induction of Treg
cells, whose infusion into cancer-bearing patients would
be highly undesirable. From a clinical standpoint, CIK
cells are likely to be efficacious at disease stages where
the tumor burden is relatively low or in an adjuvant set-
ting, rather than in advanced disease [10]. It is presently
unknown whether the overall survival rate is significantly
affected by this type of adoptive cellular therapy. Future
studies will have to address whether CIK cells differen-
tiated with TG offer advantages over those obtained with
aCD3-based protocols and whether they may be inte-
grated into current cancer treatments.
