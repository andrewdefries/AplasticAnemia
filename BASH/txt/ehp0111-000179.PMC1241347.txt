Observed rates of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
(NHL) incidence and mortality have
increased markedly in the United States and
other countries in the last three to four
decades (1). The increase has been ascribed, in
part, to changing diagnostic patterns, the use
of immunosuppressive drugs, and increasing
rates of HIV infection. However, a substantial
fraction of the excess remains unexplained
(2,3). Widespread exposures to organic sol-
vents, pesticides, hair dyes, and other com-
mon chemicals have been suggested, and
several of these factors have been linked with
elevated NHL risk in case–control and other
studies (4–6). In a hospital-based case–control
study, Hardell et al. (7) found NHL risk to be
associated with serum chlordane and related
compounds. Population-based case–control
studies have observed associations of NHL
risk with self-reported agricultural exposure to
speciﬁc organochlorine pesticides (8–10).
In this study, we measured prediagnostic
concentrations of several organochlorine com-
pounds in stored serum samples from patients
with NHL and matched controls identified
from a population-based prospective cohort
established in 1974 in Washington County,
Maryland (USA). We examined the associa-
tion between risk of NHL and lipid-
corrected serum concentrations of these
compounds. An evaluation of the risk of
NHL with serum levels of polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyl-
trichloroethane (DDT)-related compounds
was previously reported (11).
Methods
Detailed methods are reported elsewhere (11).
In brief, cases and controls were identiﬁed from
a population of 25,802 adults in Washington
County, Maryland (USA), who enrolled in
1974 in the Campaign Against Cancer and
Stroke (CLUE I), sponsored by the Johns
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and
Public Health (now the Bloomberg School of
Public Health). A 15-mL blood sample and
responses to a brief questionnaire were obtained
at enrollment. Serum was stored at –73°C. In
1989, a second blood-collection survey was
conducted (CLUE II); approximately 25% of
individuals enrolled in CLUE I also partici-
pated in CLUE II.
Cases. All incident cases of NHL were
identified from the Washington County
Cancer Registry. Cases were eligible for this
study if they were a CLUE I participant with
NHL [International Classiﬁcation of Diseases,
8th Revision (ICD-8) code 200 or 202] (12)
first diagnosed between 1 January 1975 and
31 May 1994, without a history of cancer,
except for nonmelanoma skin cancer, before
the diagnosis of NHL. Persons who had
migrated out of Washington County before
diagnosis were not eligible.
We identified 87 eligible cases, among
whom 76 had serum samples available for
analysis in our study. Of these, 51 had slides
available for pathology. On review, two cases
were judged not to be NHL (one Hodgkin’s
disease and one hairy-cell leukemia). Thus,
74 cases were included in the study.
Controls. Two controls were matched to
each case. Eligible controls were alive and
without a history of cancer at the time of case
diagnosis (except possibly nonmelanomic skin
cancer). Matching criteria included race, sex,
date of birth within 1 year, participation in
CLUE (CLUE I only or CLUE I and CLUE
II), date of blood-sample donation within 15
days, participation in private censuses con-
ducted by the Johns Hopkins University
Training Center for Public Health Research
in 1963 and 1975, and location of stored
serum (Hagerstown or Baltimore, MD, USA).
If an adequate volume of serum was not avail-
able for a control (< 3%), another individual
was selected, using the same criteria. We
matched cases and controls according to par-
ticipation in the respective CLUE cohorts to
enable comparison, in other settings, of sam-
ples from individuals who provided blood
samples in both studies.
Organochlorine analysis. Serum samples
were grouped in sets of one case and two
matched controls, in random order. Samples
were thawed, aliquoted into 1.5-mL volumes,
and immediately refrozen on dry ice. Nine
quality-control sets of three samples each were
prepared by staff at Johns Hopkins University.
The ﬁrst sample in each set was a replicate of
pooled serum samples collected during the

Increases in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) incidence and mortality rates during the past few
decades remain largely unexplained. Studies suggest that organochlorine pesticides may contribute
to an increased risk of NHL. In 1974, serum samples were obtained from 25,802 participants in
the Campaign Against Cancer and Stroke in Washington County, Maryland (USA), and cryopre-
served for future study. We measured prediagnostic levels of chlordane, lindane (γ-hexachlorocy-
clohexane), β-hexachlorocyclohexane, transnonachlor, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide,
oxychlordane, dieldrin, and hexachlorobenzene in serum samples of 74 cases of NHL and 147
matched controls. Previously, we found an association between NHL and serum levels of total
PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), but not DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and related
compounds. In this instance, there was no evidence of an association between NHL risk and
serum levels of any of the individual lipid- and recovery-corrected organochlorines that we evalu-
ated, nor of the summed chlordane-related compounds (transnonachlor, heptachlor, heptachlor
epoxide, oxychlordane). These findings do not support the hypothesis that the organochlorine
compounds included in this study are strongly linked to the development of NHL. The possibility
of a weak association cannot be excluded by these data. Key words: chlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor,
hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorocyclohexane, lindane, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, organochlorine.

CLUE I survey from 10 persons who resided
outside the study area and therefore were not
enrolled in the cohort. The second and third
samples in each set were paired replicates
from nine pooled samples of two or three
participants. We used the ﬁrst sample in each
quality-control set to calculate a between-set
coefficient of variation (CV). We used the
second and third samples in each set to calcu-
late a within-set CV (13). The nine quality-
control sets were assigned unused study
numbers and interspersed among study sam-
ples to ensure blinded laboratory analyses.
Serum samples were analyzed under
blinded conditions at the National Center for
Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (14). A reagent blank
to check for contaminants and an internal lab-
oratory quality-control sample (spiked bovine
serum) (14) were analyzed with every 10 study
serum samples. Solid-phase extraction was car-
ried out, and each sample was analyzed on
two separate gas chromatographs with elec-
tron-capture detection. The chromatographs
used different columns (DB5 and DB1701; J
& W Scientiﬁc, Folsom, CA) to reduce inter-
ference and improve selectivity. Results were
obtained for two lindane-related compounds
[lindane (γ-hexachlorocyclohexane) and β-
hexachlorocyclohexane], four chlordane- or
heptachlor-related compounds (henceforth
chlordane/heptachlor: transnonachlor, hep-
tachlor, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane),
two aldrin-related compounds (dieldrin and
endrin), hexachlorobenzene, and mirex. We
also determined the serum concentrations of
four DDT-related compounds and 28 PCB
congeners. The serum sample from one con-
trol was not successfully analyzed, resulting in
73 complete case–control sets (one case, two
controls) and one set with one case and one
control for statistical analysis. Here we report
results for grouped and single organochlorine
compounds, total chlordane/heptachlor-related
(transnonachlor, heptachlor, heptachlor epox-
ide, and oxychlordane), transnonachlor, hep-
tachlor, heptachlor epoxide, oxychlordane,
β-hexachlorocyclohexane, dieldrin, and hexa-
chlorobenzene. Fewer than 10% of cases and
controls had detectable levels of endrin,
γ-hexachlorocyclohexane, and mirex, and
ﬁndings are not reported.
Correction for total lipid in serum was
applied to all analytical values. Serum samples
were analyzed for total cholesterol and triglyc-
erides, and total lipids were calculated by a
standard formula to correct for differences in
recent food intake (15). Lipid correction was
applied to individual compounds. In addition,
we corrected for laboratory recovery, using
nonconcurrent published data for the analyti-
cal method that was used (14). We calculated
total chlordane/heptachlor-related compounds
by summing the lipid- and recovery-corrected
concentrations of transnonachlor, heptachlor,
heptachlor epoxide, and oxychlordane. Before
summing, values of these compounds were
converted to their chlordane equivalents
(transnonachlor × 0.9219, heptachlor ×
1.099, heptachlor epoxide × 1.052, and oxy-
chlordane × 0.9665).
We did not remove values below the for-
mal method detection limit. This detection
limit is designed to remove 99.86% of false-
positive values; however, this restrictive deﬁn-
ition also results in loss of valid data.
Statistical analysis. We first tested
case–control differences in levels of organo-
chlorine concentration by the Wilcoxon
signed rank test. We used conditional logistic
regression to analyze the association between
risk of NHL and quartiles of total lipid- and
recovery-corrected serum concentrations of
eight organochlorine or grouped chlordane-
related chemicals (based on the distribution
among controls). Statistical significance was
calculated by the likelihood ratio test based on
the model. This results in deletion of all par-
ticipants within a set when data are missing
for either the case or both controls. Tests for
trend were calculated by a variable equal to
the mean organochlorine concentration in
each quartile, divided by the mean concentra-
tion in the ﬁrst quartile. Similar trend results
were obtained with the organochlorine value
as a continuous variable. Questionnaire data
that we included in the analysis were as fol-
lows: years of education (< 12 years, ≥ 12
years), ever smoked cigarettes (yes/no), and
currently smoking cigarettes (yes/no). We also
included variables representing Epstein-Barr
virus early antigen (EBV-EA) seropositivity
and total PCB level (11).
The mean time to diagnosis among the
74 cases, after enrollment in the cohort in
1974, was 12.1 years (SD, 5.2; range, 1–20).
Ninety-nine percent of cases and their 147
matched controls were Caucasian. Age at
enrollment, sex distribution, and smoking
habits were similar in each group. A higher
proportion of cases (64%) than controls
(50%) were high school graduates (12).
Using results from quality-control serum
samples, we calculated interset (analyses
conducted on the same day) and intraset (sep-
arate days) CVs for six individual organochlo-
rine compounds and a combined group of
chlordane-related compounds. Intraset and
interset CVs, respectively, were as follows: β-
hexachlorocyclohexane, 0.19 and 0.36; chlor-
dane/heptachlor-related compounds, 0.24
and 0.24; transnonachlor, 0.34 and 0.09;
heptachlor epoxide, 0.33 and 0.26; oxychlor-
dane, 0.34 and 0.47; dieldrin, 0.22 and 0.30;
and hexachlorobenzene, 0.19 and 0.36. With
minor exception, the levels of these com-
pounds in our quality-control samples were
above the limit of detection. In contrast,
more than half the measured values of hep-
tachlor were at or below the nominal detec-
tion limit (Table 1), and random variation in
the extraction and analytical system con-
tributed proportionally more to the elevated
CVs observed. The intraset and interset CVs
for heptachlor were 0.89 and 1.04.
In Table 1, summary data describing
organochlorines in sera for cases and the
average of the two controls in each set are
described by the median value and 10th,
25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles. All values
are lipid adjusted and corrected for recovery,
using factors reported by Brock et al. (14). In
Table 1, we also show results from a compar-
ison of serum levels between cases and con-
trols, using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Except for β-hexachlorocylohexane, there
was no signiﬁcant difference in lipid-adjusted
and recovery-corrected level between the case
and control series. The distribution of β-
hexachlorocyclohexane was significantly ele-
vated among cases compared with controls.
Odds ratios for increasing levels of
organochlorines, stratiﬁed by quartile of lipid-
corrected and recovery-adjusted level, are
shown in Table 2. The referent level in each
instance was the lowest quartile, with the
exception of heptachlor, where tertiles were
used and all determinations below detection
were placed in the referent group. Conﬁdence
intervals included 1.0 for odds ratios of the
seven individual compounds that we analyzed,
as well as for the grouped chlordane-related
compounds. The trend of risk with increasing

icantly differ from the null at the p < 0.05
level. The risk of NHL showed an increase
with serum level of hexachlorobenzene that
was attenuated when the logistic model was
adjusted for serum PCBs, EBV titer, and other
factors. Data were also analyzed without cor-
rection for laboratory recovery, with similar
results for all odds ratios and tests for trend.
Discussion
In this nested case–control study, we examined
the association between risk of NHL and
prediagnostic serum levels of several
organochlorine compounds. We found no evi-
dence of association with NHL for any of the
compounds we examined: β-hexachlorocyclo-
hexane, transnonachlor, heptachlor, heptachlor
epoxide, oxychlordane, hexachlorobenzene,
dieldrin, or summed chlordane-related com-
pounds (transnonachlor, heptachlor, hep-
tachlor epoxide, and oxychlordane). An
association with β-hexachlorocyclohexane
observed with a rank sum test between cases
and controls was not conﬁrmed by an analysis
of the exposure–response relationship. These
data do not support hypotheses of links with
these compounds suggested by ﬁndings from
case reports and interview and body-burden
studies of NHL, other hematopoietic cancers,
and related hematologic conditions such as
aplastic anemia (7,8,16,17). The null ﬁndings
reported here pose a striking contrast with our
earlier finding in this study population of a
strong and consistent association of NHL risk
with total serum PCBs (11).
The major strength of this study derives
from the prospective collection of biologic
samples in a nested case–control design in a
general population setting. Differential bias
from cases and controls could not have inﬂu-
enced the result because all sera were obtained
and frozen many years before diagnosis, when
participants were healthy. Our analytical
method to measure organochlorines was
designed to exclude many interfering com-
pounds (14), and we corrected for serum
lipids as well as compound-specific recovery

efficiencies. All analyses were performed
blindly with respect to case–control status
and without knowledge of which samples
were included for quality-control purposes.
The serum values of the organochlorine com-
pounds that we measured were comparable
with levels found in other U.S. populations,
after accounting for decreases in serum con-
centrations of most compounds since 1974,
when our sera were collected (18,19). It is
unlikely that outmigration from the study
affected our results. A systematic sample of
4% of households provided an estimate of
1.5% outmigration per year in the approxi-
mate 10-year period between a census held in
1975 and 1 April 1985. In addition, for out-
migration to influence our result, it would
have to be differential with respect to future
NHL diagnosis as well as serum level of one
or more organochlorine compounds.
Despite the unique strengths of this study,
interpretation of its generally null results
should be tempered by several considerations.
The CVs for the compounds of interest here,
derived from randomly inserted quality-con-
trol samples, were somewhat larger than we
previously found for PCB or DDT/DDE
(dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) determi-
nations (11). The variance introduced by the
implied measurement error may have con-
tributed to variability in odds ratios, possibly
obscuring associations of relatively small mag-
nitude. We lipid-corrected all organochlorine
measures, based on the notion that the com-
pounds of interest are highly lipophilic and
that equilibrium is rapidly established between
adipose tissue and serum lipid (19). Finally, it
is possible that confounding was present in
this study and obscured associations of
organochlorines with risk of NHL. This
would be the case if etiologically relevant fac-
tors were inversely associated with the
organochlorines we examined.
Animal bioassays have indicated the car-
cinogenicity of several compounds that were
the focus of this study. Using a widely
accepted classiﬁcation scheme, expert commit-
tees convened by the International Agency for
Research on Cancer have cited “sufﬁcient evi-
dence,” based on evidence from laboratory
animals, for carcinogenicity of chlordane/
heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, α-hexachloro-
cyclohexane, and technical grade hexachloro-
cyclohexane (20,21). There is “limited
evidence” for carcinogenicity of dieldrin,
γ-hexachlorocyclohexane, and β-hexachloro-
cyclohexane (20,21). Although the epidemio-
logic evidence is far from deﬁnitive, there are
suggestions that one or more of these com-
pounds are human carcinogens and may be
related to elevated risk of NHL. Farmers, who
have generally elevated exposures to many of
the compounds under consideration, are at
elevated risk of NHL in many studies (22,23).
Chlordane was linked with NHL in a
case–control study in the midwestern United
States (9). Hematopoietic cancer deaths were
not in excess in a small cohort of workers
employed in the manufacture of chlordane and
heptachlor (24). In a hospital-based study,
Hardell et al. (7) found an association of NHL
with postdiagnostic adipose tissue levels of six
summed chlordane compounds among 27
patients and 17 hospital-based controls, with
an especially strong association for trans-
nonachlor. We were not able to confirm
Hardell et al.’s ﬁndings in the present popula-
tion-based study based on prediagnostic serum
chlordane among 74 NHL cases and 147 con-
trols. In our data, serum transnonachlor had a
weak negative association with NHL risk.
Hexachlorocyclohexane, produced by pho-
tochlorination of benzene, results in α-, β-, γ-,
and other isomers (25). Lindane, the γ-isomer,
is used as an insecticide. However, little bioac-
cumulation of lindane occurs. We detected it
in only 5% of serum samples, an insufﬁcient
number for statistical analysis. The β-isomer of
hexachlorocyclohexane is more stable. It bioac-
cumulates in adipose tissue and was found in
more than 90% of our serum samples, with a
median concentration among controls of
138.0 ng/g lipid. Case reports describe the
occurrence of aplastic anemia and other blood
dyscrasias after lindane exposure (17,26–28).
The carcinogenicity of lindane is less clear in
humans than in laboratory animals. The
strength of associations of NHL with lindane
exposure, in data pooled from population-
based case–control studies in four midwestern
states, were decreased after adjustment for
potential confounding from 2,4-dichlorophe-
noxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and diazinon (29).
The carcinogenicity of the β-isomer is less
clear. In this study, we did not observe an asso-
ciation of NHL with prediagnostic serum
β-hexachlorocyclohexane level.
Although cancer mortality has been stud-
ied in several occupational groups exposed to
aldrin and dieldrin, cohorts were small and
the studies lacked sufficient statistical power
to observe any but the strongest carcinogenic
effects for relatively rare cancers such as NHL
(30–34). Two small case–control studies of
leukemia and lymphoma examined levels of
aldrin/dieldrin in the bone marrow at diagno-
sis, with no observed differences (35,36).
Likewise, data on carcinogenic effects of
hexachlorobenzene in human populations are
limited. Elevated cancer prevalence was noted
among male chemical workers with elevated
levels of serum hexachlorobenzene (37).
Micronuclei were in excess in peripheral lym-
phocytes from 41 workers exposed to hexa-
chlorobenzene and other compounds (38).
No differences in hexachlorobenzene levels
were found in the bone marrow of 13
leukemia or lymphoma patients and 16
healthy adult controls (35). We found no
association between NHL risk and serum lev-
els of either dieldrin or hexachlorobenzene.
In summary, we found no consistent dif-
ferences in prediagnostic serum levels of sev-
eral organochlorine compounds among NHL
patients and matched controls in a population
setting. Our results are reassuring in providing
some evidence against a strong, consistent
association between NHL and serum levels of
the compounds that we analyzed at levels
found in the general population. Our results,
however, do not exclude the possibility of
weaker associations that may be important in
more highly exposed populations, such as
agricultural workers.
