Background
Chimerism analysis is an important tool for assessing the origin of hematopoietic cells
after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) and can be used to detect impending
graft rejection and the recurrence of underlying malignant or nonmalignant diseases.
Methods
This study included 24 patients who underwent myeloablative allo-SCT. DNA was ex-
tracted from nucleated cells (NCs), T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, and the chimerism
status of these cell fractions was determined by STR-PCR performed using an automated
fluorescent DNA analyzer.
Results
Twenty-three out of the 24 patients achieved engraftment. Mixed chimerism (MC) in NCs,
but not in T cells and NK cells, was significantly correlated with disease relapse. MC in
all cell fractions was correlated with mortality. Ten patients (41.6%) developed extensive
chronic GVHD. Six patients had MC in T cells, and 3 of them had chronic GVHD. Four
patients with MC and relapse received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), and among them,
3 had secondary relapse. Further, the chimerism status differed among different cell line-
ages in 6 patients with myeloid malignancies.
Conclusion
The implications of MC in lymphocyte subsets are an important area for future research.
Chimerism analysis in lineage-specific cells permits detection of relapse and facilitates
the monitoring of therapeutic interventions. These results can provide the basic data for
chimerism analysis after myeloablative SCT.

INTRODUCTION
Chimerism analysis is an important tool used to assess
the origin of hematopoietic cells after allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (allo-SCT). After allo-SCT, both donor and
recipient hematopoietic cells can coexist in the recipient,
and this state is called mixed chimerism (MC). In patients
with MC, the percentage of recipient cells could remain
stable, increase, or spontaneously decrease over time [1-8].
The presence of recipient cells in the peripheral blood (PB)
or bone marrow (BM) of patients during the posttransplant
period is an important prognostic indicator of transplant
rejection, disease relapse, and graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) [9-12].
Several methods have been developed to assess the level
of donor engraftment after allo-SCT. Fluorescent in situ hy-
bridization of sex chromosomes (XY-FISH) and PCR-based
analysis of polymorphic DNA sequences are the most widely
used techniques, and real-time PCR techniques based on
analysis of the Y chromosome or on single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) are being evaluated. Currently, fluo-
rescence-based PCR amplification of short tandem repeats
(STRs) is the gold standard for analyzing post-transplant
chimerism and has been used in most studies [13-15].
PB or BM is most often used for chimerism analysis, with

or without further manipulation of different cell subpo-
pulations. It is important to realize that patients could show
complete chimerism (CC) in one cell type, for example, T
cells, whereas others could be totally or in part recipi-
ent-derived. This is called split chimerism [3, 8].
Many studies have investigated nonmyeloablative con-
ditioning regimens for split chimerism. We compared do-
nor-recipient chimerism levels in nucleated cells (NCs) and
lineage-specific cell subtypes, namely, T cells and natural
killer (NK) cells, after myeloablative allo-SCT by using multi-
plex STR-PCR in order to determine the sensitivity and
specificity for the detection of minimal residual disease.
Moreover, we analyzed the correlation between chimerism
status and clinical outcome, including cumulative incidence
of GVHD and relapse. There have been few studies in Korea
about chimerism or discrepant results among various cell
lineages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
1. Patients and specimens
This study included 24 patients who underwent allo-SCT
between December 2001 and September 2008 in our in-
stitution; patient characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-treated PB samples
were obtained from both the donor and recipient before
transplantation. After allo-SCT, recipient PB samples were
drawn every month for the first 3 months and then every
3 months for 2 years or until the recipient’s death. NCs
were isolated by density gradient centrifugation by using
Ficoll-Paque (d=1.077 g/mL; Pharmacia, Sweden). T cells
(CD3＋
) and NK cells (CD56＋
) cells were separated using
the RosetteSep antibody cocktail (Stem Cell Technologies;
Vancouver, BC, Canada) according to the manufacturer's
instructions, with minor modifications. Genomic DNA was
extracted from NCs and from CD3＋
and CD56＋
cells by
using the QIAamp Blood Kit (Qiagen; Chatsworth, CA, USA).
2. Chimerism analysis
Chimerism studies were performed using the AmpF/STR
Identifiler PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems;
Norwalk, CT, USA), which simultaneously amplifies 15 STR
loci and the gender-determination marker Amelogenin. The
PCR products were analyzed using ABI 3100 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Fluorescence was quantified,
and the precise size of the DNA fragments was calculated
with the Genotyper software (Applied Biosystems). The per-

centages of donor and recipient DNA were calculated from
each pair of informative STR markers on the basis of in-
dividual proportions of donor (D) and recipient (R) peak
areas in relation to the summation of all signals, for example,
recipient’s DNA (%)=(R1+R2)/(D1+D2+R1+R2)×100.
3. Definition of MC
CC was defined as the presence of ＞95% donor-type
hematopoietic cells after allo-SCT. Patients with CC at a
certain time point after transplantation can develop a state
of MC. MC is defined as the presence of 5-95% donor-type
hematopoietic cells. Split chimerism was defined as CC in
one cell type and the presence of recipient-derived cells
(totally or in-part) in others.
4. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using the SPSS
12.0 statistical package for Windows (SPSS; Chicago, IL,
USA). A P-value of ＜0.05 was considered to be statically
significant.

of 3.8×106

cells/kg). The median follow-up period after transplantation
was 19 months (range, 1-59 months). The median periods
required for recovering the absolute counts of neutrophils
(＞500/μL) and platelets (＞20,000/μL) were 16 days (range,
11-40 days) and 25 days (range, 17-60 days), respectively.
The number of informative STR markers in donor-recipient
pairs ranged from 4 to 15 (median, 9). The markers were
from a set of 16 polymorphic loci, including D18S51,
D8S1179, D16S539, D2S1338 and FGA, which were the most
informative loci, and the loci were amplified in 16 or 17
donor-recipient pairs.
2. Chimerism analysis of patients
Among the 24 patients, 23 achieved engraftment and only
1 patient (unique patient number [UPN] 7) did not. Twenty-
two patients achieved CC in NCs after a median of 23 days
(range, 12-39 days), and 1 patient (UPN 17) achieved CC
after 103 days. One patient (UPN 2) underwent trans-
plantation before the assessment of chimerism by multiplex
STR-PCR. NC chimerism was analyzed more than 4 times
in all patients (except UPN 2), and the results in T cells
and NK cells during the early engraftment period (≤30
days after transplantation) could not be confirmed because
of low cell numbers.
1) Correlation between chimerism status and relapse
Nine, 6, and 5 patients had 100% recipient-derived NCs,
T cells, and NK cells or MC in these cells, respectively.
Among these 9, 6, and 5 patients, relapse occurred in 8,
3, and 3 patients, respectively. Further, 3 patients (UPNs
3, 7, and 10) with relapse had 100% recipient-derived NK
cells; NCs and T cells comprised various percentages of recipi-
ent-derived cells (Table 2). Patients with relapse had MC
or 100% recipient-derived cells in a part cell type and/or
all cell types. In two patients (UPNs 5 and 11), MC in NCs
was detected after relapse was clinically diagnosed. MC in
NCs (P=0.000), but not in T cells and NK cells (P＞0.05),
was significantly correlated with disease relapse (Table 3).
2) Correlation between chimerism status and mortality
Among the 24 patients, 8 died between days 80 and 571
(median, 307 days). Five patients died because of a relapse
or progressive disease (AML, 2; CML, 1; ALL, 1; and myelo-
dysplastic syndrome [MDS], 1) and 3 patients died because
of transplant-related complications such as pneumonia.
These dead patients included 6 out of the 9 patients with
MC in NCs or 100% recipient-derived NCs (P=0.007).
Patients (4/6) with MC in T cells or 100% recipient-derived
T cells (P=0.046) and 4/5 patients with MC in NK cells
or 100% recipient-derived NK cells (P=0.013) died. The re-
sults of all lineage-specific chimerism analyses were sig-
nificantly correlated with mortality (Table 3). Of the 8 re-
lapsed patients who had MC in NCs or 100% recipi-
ent-derived NCs, 4 received donor lymphocyte infusion
(DLI) at a median of 252 days (range, 104-457 days); among

these, 1 patient (UPN 11) maintained complete remission
during 867 days and 3 patients (UPNs, 1, 5, and 7) died
because of secondary relapse (Fig. 1).
3) Correlation between chimerism status and acute/chronic
GVHD
Of the total of 24 patients, 9 (37.5%) developed acute
GVHD, and 3 of them developed the condition after DLI.
Of the 9 patients with acute GVHD, 4, 2, and 2 patients
had 100% recipient-derived NCs, T cells, and NK cells or
MC in these cells, respectively. MC in all cell types was
not significantly correlated with the incidence of acute
GVHD (P＞0.05). Of the 24 patients, 10 (41.6%) had ex-
tensive chronic GVHD. Among these patients, 6, 3, and
1 patients had 100% recipient-derived NCs, T cells, and
NK cells or MC in these cells, respectively. Six patients had
MC in T cells, and 3 of them had chronic GVHD. In UPN
19, T cells consisted of 29.0%, 19.5%, and 18.5% recipient
cells on days 32, 93, and 119, respectively, and chronic GVHD
was observed continuously from days 130 to 220 (Table 4).
UPNs 3 and 6 had MC in T cells around the onset of chronic
GVHD. Two patients (UPNs 7 and 10) with MC in T cells
had acute GVHD. Another patient (UPN 24) did not have
acute/chronic GVHD. Four of the 10 patients with chronic
GVHD showed CC in all cell types. MC in all cell types
was not correlated with the incidence of acute and chronic
GVHD (P＞0.05; Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Chimerism analyses are routinely performed to monitor
engraftment [1-4]. The persistence or reappearance of autolo-
gous cells has often been observed after SCT. Several studies
performed during the last 20 years have reported that MC
is associated with graft rejection [11, 16-20]. Chimerism anal-
ysis is still controversial because some studies did not find a
correlation between chimerism and disease relapse [21, 22].
In this study, we analyzed the chimerism status of NCs,
T cells, and NK cells from myeloablative allo-SCT patients
by using multiplex STR-PCR and determined the correlation
between these results and the clinical outcome. We found
that among the patients observed, 9 had MC in NCs or
100% recipient-derived NCs, and the disease relapsed in
all the patients, except UPN 19. In 2 patients, MC in NCs
was detected after the clinical diagnosis of relapse. This may
be explained by the long intervals between chimerism analy-
sis and SCT, which increase the risk of overlooking a rapidly
evolving MC before hematological relapse. MC in NCs was
significantly correlated with disease relapse. Five patients
had MC in NK cells or 100% recipient-derived NK cells,
and 3 of these patients had 100% recipient-derived NK cells.
NCs and T cells comprised recipient-derived cells in various
proportions. NK cells were not significantly correlated with
relapse despite MC in NK cells in patients with disease
relapse. Baron et al. [17] found that in patients who had
Korean J Hematol 2011;46:18-23.
22 Ri-Young Goh, et al.
undergone non-myeloablative SCT, low donor T-cell and
NK-cell chimerism levels on day 14 were associated with
high probabilities of graft rejection and that an early estab-
lishment of donor NK-cell chimerism was associated with
better progression-free survival. We found that the chimer-
ism status differed among different cell lineages in 6 patients
with myeloid malignancies (UPNs 3, 6, 10, 15, 19, and 24).
Four out of the 6 cases were published previously [23]. Zeiser
et al. [18] reported that conventional chimerism analysis
had lower sensitivity (＜3%) than lineage-specific chimerism
analysis (0.1%). Patients with MC in NK cells or 100% recipi-
ent-derived NK cells were diagnosed with AML or MDS.
One patient (UPN 15) with AML had 54.5% blasts in the
BM and no blasts in the PB. Few studies have reported
relapse in the BM without prior detection of recipient cells
in the PB [24]. Myeloblasts were not CD56-positive at the
time of diagnosis in any of the cases. However, we could
not totally exclude the possibility that the blasts expressed
low levels of CD56 from the onset or acquired the ectopic
marker during treatment or relapse. The data supported the
concept that persistence of MC in NK cells in patients with
AML and MDS reduces the graft-versus-malignancy (GVM)
effect and helps to promote relapse. Clausen et al. [25] found
that a grafted NK cell dose was associated with a lower
risk of relapse and improved survival.
We confirmed that the presence of 100% recipient-derived
NCs, T cells, and NK cells or MC in these cells was correlated
with mortality. This observation indicated the importance
of short interval chimerism analysis; immediate therapeutic
intervention is needed if an increase in the level of MC
is noted. The role of DLI in patients with relapse is unclear
[18, 26]. In this study, 4 patients with MC and relapse received
DLI, and all, except UPN 11, had secondary relapse. In the
present study, patients who had developed increased MC
and, therefore, received additional DLI did not have en-
hanced GVM effect, and autologous hematopoiesis could
not be eliminated. McSweeney et al. [27] recommended con-
sider DLI for declining donor chimerism, but a higher than
20% of donor T cells chimerism, stable MC of ＞2 weeks,
or progressive disease. Further evidence of reduced allor-
eactivity in patients with MC is provided by a lower incidence
of severe acute GVHD and a higher incidence of relapse
in patients with MC after SCT than in patients with CC
[28, 29]. Michallet et al. [28] showed a significant correlation
between chimerism status and overall survival as well as
between chimerism status and the incidences of acute and
chronic GVHD. Mattsson et al. [29] reported that about
82% of patients had MC for donor/host T cells at the onset
of acute GVHD. In this study, MC in all cell types was
not correlated with the incidence of acute and chronic
GVHD. However, 6 patients showed MC in T cells, and
3 (UPNs 3, 6, 19) of these patients had chronic GVHD.
UPNs 7 and 10 with MC in T cells had acute GVHD. Although
no clear conclusion could be made because of the lack of
statistically significant correlation, MC in T cells may influ-
ence GVHD.
In the case of high-risk patients or when other suitable
disease markers are not available, sequential chimerism anal-
ysis in leukocyte subsets permits early detection of relapse
and facilitates the monitoring of therapeutic interventions.
Furthermore, prospective clinical studies should include
large numbers of patients with the same disease. Despite
the above-mentioned drawbacks; we believe that these chi-
merism data could be used as the fundamental basis for
monitoring the outcome of myeloablative SCT, which is
commonly performed in Korea.
