A petrochemical worker with aplastic anemia was referred to our hospital. He worked in a petro-
leum resin-producing factory and had been exposed to low-level beazene while packaging the
powder resin and pouring lime into a deactivation.tank According to the yearly environmental
survey ofthe worling area, the airborne benzene level was approximately 0.28 ppm. Exposure to
benzene, a common chemical used widely in industy, may progressively lead. to pancytopeia,:
aplastic anemia, and leukemia. The hematotoxidty ofbenzene is related to the amount and dun-
dion ofexposure. Most risk predictions for benzene exposures have been based on rubber workers
who were exposed to high concentrations. In the petroleum industry, the concentration of ben-
zene is relatively low, and there are disputes over the toxicity of low-level benzene because of a
lack ofevidence. In this paper we report the case ofaplastic anemia induced by low-level benzene
exposure. Key works: apastic anemia, benzene, petrochemical worker. Environ Health Perspt

Case Presentation
A 45-year-old petrochemical worker with
aplastic anemia was referred to our depart-
ment of industrial medicine in November
1998 to evaluate a relationship between his
job history and the disease. The patient
worked in a petroleum resin-producing fac-
tory that used heavy raw pyrolysis gasoline
(H-RPG) containing 0.3% benzene as a raw
material. The petroleum resins are used pri-
marily in the production of paints and
adhesives.
In 1977 the patient began working in a
packaging-process area where he packed
powder resin into bags. Each bag weighed 80
kg, and the patient normally worked 8
hr/day. In May 1993 he moved to a deactiva-
tion-process area where he poured lime into a
deactivation tank twice a day, 40 kg each
time, and drained the tank after the chemical
reaction (Figure 1). The patient actually
spent < 30 min/day in the deactivation
process; for the remainder of the work day,
he waited in a control room. Other than
doing routine work in the packaging and
deactivation processes, he also occasionally
cleaned the reaction tank; because of this the
patient may have been exposed to high-level
benzene for short periods. While working he
wore a facial mask for protection from resin
powder and noxious gas.
In September 1998 the patient com-
plained of fatigue and lethargy. He visited a
local dinic and routine physical and laboratory
examinations were performed. The blood test
performed at this time showed pancytopenia
and the patient was referred to St. Mary's
Hospital. After admission to the department
of hematology, a bone marrow biopsy was
performed. This biopsy showed hypocellular-
ity with fatty infiltration, which is consistent
with aplastic anemia. A chromosomal study
showed a normal male karyotype without
any aberrations.
The patient did not smoke cigarettes or
drink alcoholic beverages, and his history of
drug and radiation exposure was insignifi-
cant. His serologic markers and history of
viral infection were negative. There were no
abnormal hematologic findings in the
patients's yearly occupational fitness exami-
nation at the factory, which was taken before
the onset ofhis symptoms (Table 1).
Because there was no matching compati-
ble donor, the patient was given blood trans-
fusions, antilymphocyte immunoglobulins,
and cyclosporin. He was discharged in
December 1998 with symptomatic improve-
ment and laboratory stabilization. In January
1999, he was readmitted and treated for
opportunistic herpes zoster infection.
Industrial hygienists performed routine
environmental surveys of the factory twice
each year from 1993 to 1998; the air concen-
trations of benzene were approximately 0.28
ppm. We performed an environmental sur-
vey of the workplace again after the patient
was referred (Table 2). We also measured
trans-trans-muconic acid (tt-MA) in the urine
ofworkers to assess benzene exposure.
Discussion
Benzene, an aromatic hydrocarbon, is used
widely in industries as a solvent for rubber
and inks and as a starting material in chemi-
cal synthesis. It is a natural constituent of
petroleum, and the general population is
exposed to benzene from gasoline, indoor
air, smoking, car exhaust, and groundwater.
The hematotoxicity of benzene is related to
the amount and duration ofexposure (1). At
high levels of exposure (air concentration
> 100 ppm), the incidence ofaplastic anemia
is approximately 1/100 individuals exposed;
at lower levels ofexposure (10-20 ppm), this
drops abruptly to approximately 1/10,000
(2). In the past, benzene exposure > 100
ppm frequently occurred in workplaces, and
the causal relationship between high-level
benzene exposure and its toxicity has been
known since the nineteenth century. As data
indicating carcinogenecity of benzene
increased (3,4), the standards of occupation-
al exposure and the airborne level in work-
places have been progressively lowered. In
Korea, benzene levels in paint production,
printing, and glue adhesion are approximate-
ly 2.0 ppm [geometrical mean (5)]; in the
petroleum industry in the United States, the
level ofbenzene is 0.3 ppm for an 8-hr time-
weighted average (TWA) (6).
Risk assessment studies have demonstrat-
ed that there is significant excess risk associ-
ated with a lifetime exposure to 10 ppm
benzene and that this risk would be lowered
with a decrease in the exposure level. In
1987, the U.S. government lowered the

occupational benzene standard from 10 ppm
to 1 ppm on the basis of qualitative and
quantitative risk assessments ofleukemia (7).
However, the cause-effect relationship of
low-level benzene exposure is under consid-
erable debate because the studies of risk
assessment depend not only on an assump-
tion of a particular carcinogenic model but
also on dose-response information from epi-
demiologic studies. Also, the studies did not
successfully demonstrate excess risk at partic-
ular concentrations; the reduction of current
standards is still in dispute worldwide. The
8-hr-TWA exposure standard is 10 ppm
(e.g., Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Japan,
Korea, and the Netherlands) or 5 ppm (e.g.,
Germany and the United Kingdom) in
many countries (8).
Etiologies ofaplastic anemia. Aplastic
anemia can be caused by both hereditary and
acquired factors. Drugs, viruses, organic
compounds, and radiation are implicated
causes ofthe acquired form. Fanconi anemia
is a well-known inherited abnormality that
causes the disease. At least five different
genetic defects may induce Fanconi anemia,
and one variant has a mutation ofthe FACC
gene, which is involved in the cellular
response to DNA damage (9).
Aplastic anemia may be acquired from
the use of drugs (e.g., antimetabolites, anti-
tumor agents, gold, chloramphenicol,
phenylbutazone, sulfonamides); radiation;
chemicals (e.g., benzene, solvents, insecti-
cides); viruses (e.g., non-A, non-B, non-C
hepatitis virus, human immunodeficiency
virus, Epstein-Barr virus); paroxysmal noc-
turnal hemoglobinuria; pregnancy; connec-
tive tissue disorders; and graft versus host
disease. Hereditary causes of aplastic anemia
are Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita,
and Schwachman syndrome.
Fifty percent of cases are idiopathic, and
even for patients for whom a well-defined
association between exposure and subse-
quent development of aplastic anemia has
been established, it remains unclear why
only a small proportion ofthose exposed to a
given agent develop the disease.
Hematotoxicity and carcinogenecity. In
acquired aplastic anemia, the disease results
from two main pathogenic mechanisms: an
acquired intrinsic stem cell defect and an
immunosuppressive mechanism (). Benzene
itself is not myelotoxic or mutagenic. It is
principally metabolized in the liver, and the
metabolites are transported to the bone mar-
row and other organs. The active metabolites
of benzene exert direct toxicity and alter dif-
ferentiation patterns in the bone marrow. The
immunosuppressive function of benzene is
keeping with its lymphocytotoxic effect (2).
The carcinogenic mechanism of benzene
is different from that of other chemicals.
Some carcinogens, such as benzopyrene, aro-
matic amines, and aflatoxin, are thought to
be activated to a single, ultimate carcino-
genic metabolite, which is highly elec-
trophilic; these carcinogens are also thought
to bind strongly to DNA in a covalent fash-
ion (10). Benzene is thought to be carcino-
genic because of the combined effects of its
metabolites (e.g., hydroquinone, p-benzo-
quinone, 1,2,4-benzenetriol); the potential
mechanism involves these metabolites bind-
ing to DNA and causing oxidative stress
(11). These active metabolites are involved
in the causation of chromosome damage
such as strand breaks, hyperploidy, and dele-
tions in humans and animal species exposed
to benzene. These chromosomal aberrations
may lead to the inactivation ofp53 or other
tumor-suppressor genes, and these events
may be involved in leukemogenesis (4.

The data regarding benzene-induced
clastogenesis in hematopoietic cells are not
conclusive, however (6). Some investigators
indicated that numerical or structural chro-
mosomal aberrations were increased in work-
ers who had long-term exposure to benzene;
the ratios were increased in leukemia that
occurred after benzene exposure. Others were
not able to show any significant differences
between the exposed and control groups (12.
Pancytopenia and aplastic anemia are
not distinct diseases, but rather a continuum
of changes reflecting the severity of bone
marrow damage. Further, Aksoy and Erdem
(3) reported the progression of aplastic ane-
mia in a benzene-exposed individual through
a preleukemic phase into frank acute
leukemia. These findings were observed with
high-level benzene exposure and not with
low-level exposure.
Chemical, medical, or toxic substances
may cause aplastic anemia in a dose-depen-
dent or idiosyncratic way. To date, there is
no evidence that low-level benzene exposure
induces aplastic anemia through an idiosyn-
cratic mechanism (13). However, benzene
metabolism is quantitatively different at dif-
ferent dose levels. A relatively higher propor-
tion of benzene is converted to toxic
metabolites at low doses, suggesting that lin-
ear extrapolation of risk from high-dose
studies may underestimate the true risk of
low-dose benzene exposure (7).
Risk assessment. The establishment of
benzene toxicity and setting of current stan-
dards has been primarily because ofepidemi-
ologic studies. Most investigators base risk
predictions for exposures on rubber workers
who were exposed to high concentrations of
benzene; an exposure-response analysis by
Rabbe and Wong (14) indicated that there
was no increase of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) for cumulative exposure < 200 ppm-
years. The exposure levels of petroleum
industry workers are generally < 1 ppm on an
8-hr TWA basis, and the excess cases of
leukemia were inconsistently observed.
Christie et al. (15) reported a significant
excess of myeloid leukemia in Australian

petroleum industry workers. Jakobsson et al.
(16) also reported a significantly elevated risk
of AML in male gasoline station attendants
in Sweden, but in many other studies, no
increased risk ofAML was observed in petro-
leum workers (14). In a study of Canadian
petroleum distribution workers, Schnatter et
al. (17) examined leukemia risk by benzene
exposure level and noted the possibility that
long-term exposure, regardless ofthe concen-
tration, can result in leukemia.
Recently, there have been increasing con-
cerns about low-level benzene toxicity in
communities and work areas because benzene
is ubiquitous in the environment; a few case
reports imply that < 0.1 ppm benzene, even
for a short time, induced hematologic abnor-
malities. In 1994 Stern et al. (18) reported a
case of aplastic anemia in an American sol-
dier who fought in the GulfWar; the disease
was attributed to a possible exposure to ben-
zene in the toxic smoke produced by burning
oil wells. The smoke contained 3.1-9.1
ng/m3 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
Molinini et al. (19) reported a case ofaplastic
anemia in a young coke plant worker who
was exposed to low-level benzene for 3 years.
In 1994 the Italian Toxicology Commission
reported that 3-50 cases of leukemia out of
1,000 could be caused by benzene from
motor vehicle exhaust (19).
Biomonitoring. Measurement of blood
benzene concentrations and benzene in
exhaled breath are good means of assessing
exposure, but the timing of measurement is
important because of the short half-life of
benzene. Urinary phenol has traditionally
been used to biomonitor benzene exposure
because roughly one-fourth to one-half of
administered benzene is metabolized to phe-
nol. However, there are other sources of uri-
nary phenol, including dietary intake (20).
When exposures are to relatively low levels of
benzene, the background level of phenol
obscures the benzene exposure. The measure-
ment of phenol can be used to determine if
someone has been recently exposed to high
levels of benzene, but it is not useful for
screening in the workplace, particularly ifthe
level ofbenzene is low. Urinary S-phenylmer-
capturic acid (S-PMA) and tt-MA are now
used instead of phenol in biologic monitor-
ing ofbenzene. Although the analytical sensi-
tivity of the S-PMA assay is much higher
than that oftt-MA, tt-MA is a more sensitive
biomarker than S-PMA and the assay is easier
to perform and is more readily available (21).
Shortcomings of the tt-MA assay are that
there are other sources of this urinary
metabolite, such as metabolism ofsorbic acid
(a food additive), and that tt-MA has a rela-
tively shorter urinary half-life than S-PMA
(22). The mean postshift tt-MA concentra-
tions corresponding to a benzene 8-hr TWA
exposure of 0.5-1.0 ppm are 0.8-1.4 mg/g
creatinine (23), and exposure to 5.0 ppm
benzene resulted in 3-8 mg/L urine (24).
We measured urinary tt-MA of the co-
workers of the patient in this case to assess
benzene exposure. Airborne benzene concen-
trations were higher in the deactivation
process than in the packaging process, but
urinary tt-MA levels were higher in the
packaging workers. The packaging process
was an indoor process, and the workers
packed the products continuously through
the work day. In the outdoor deactivation
process, however, the workers poured the
lime into the tank and drained the tank after
the reaction; exposure was intermittent and
total exposure time was < 30 min. For the
packaging workers, the longer exposure time
in a relatively closed space seems to result in
higher levels ofurinary tt-MA.
Conclusion
The patient in this case was otherwise healthy,
and there was no extraoccupational exposure
to hematotoxic agents in his daily life (e.g.,
hobbies, medications, etc.). He had not lived
near a nuclear power station. The serologic
markers and history for viral infection was
negative. The chromosomal study was nor-
mal, with no aberrations observed. Based on
the environmental investigation of the
patient's workplace, he was exposed to low-
level benzene for 21 years while packaging the
powder resin and pouring lime into the deac-
tivation tank. We also suspect that he had
been exposed to high-level benzene for a short
time when he cleaned the reaction tank.
The toxicity of low-level benzene is not
only an occupational problem; environmen-
tal exposures of the general population to
benzene from car exhaust, cigarette smoking,
and indoor air should also be of concern.
More research is needed to establish the toxi-
city oflow-level benzene.
