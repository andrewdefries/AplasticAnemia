acute respiratory failure in children: a concise
review

Abstract
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) refers to the delivery of mechanical respiratory support without
the use of endotracheal intubation (ETI). The present review focused on the effectiveness of NPPV in children > 1
month of age with acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to different conditions. ARF is the most common cause of
cardiac arrest in children. Therefore, prompt recognition and treatment of pediatric patients with pending
respiratory failure can be lifesaving. Mechanical respiratory support is a critical intervention in many cases of ARF. In
recent years, NPPV has been proposed as a valuable alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in this
acute setting. Recent physiological studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of NPPV in children with ARF.
Several pediatric clinical studies, the majority of which were noncontrolled or case series and of small size, have
suggested the effectiveness of NPPV in the treatment of ARF due to acute airway (upper or lower) obstruction or
certain primary parenchymal lung disease, and in specific circumstances, such as postoperative or postextubation
ARF, immunocompromised patients with ARF, or as a means to facilitate extubation. NPPV was well tolerated with
rare major complications and was associated with improved gas exchange, decreased work of breathing, and ETI
avoidance in 22-100% of patients. High FiO2 needs or high PaCO2 level on admission or within the first hours after
starting NPPV appeared to be the best independent predictive factors for the NPPV failure in children with ARF.
However, many important issues, such as the identification of the patient, the right time for NPPV application, and
the appropriate setting, are still lacking. Further randomized, controlled trials that address these issues in children
with ARF are recommended.
Introduction
Breathing difficulties are common symptoms in children
and common reason for visits to the emergency depart-
ment [1]. In United Kingdom, respiratory illnesses (both
acute and chronic) accounted for 20% of weekly general
practitioner consultations, 15% of hospital admissions,
and 8% of deaths in childhood in 2001 [2]. Although the
great majority of cases are benign and self-limited,
requiring no intervention, some patients will require a
higher level of respiratory support. Invasive mechanical
ventilation (IMV) is a critical intervention in many cases
of acute respiratory failure (ARF), but there are definite
risks associated with endotracheal intubation (ETI) [3].
By providing respiratory support without ETI, non-
invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) may be, in
appropriately selected patients, an extremely valuable
alternative to IMV. It is generally much safer than IMV
and has been shown to decrease resource utilization and
to avoid the myriad of complications associated with
ETI, including upper airway trauma, laryngeal swelling,
postextubation vocal cord dysfunction, and nosocomial
infections [3]. NPPV usually refers to continuous posi-
tive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel respiratory sup-
port, including expiratory positive airway pressure
(EPAP) and inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP),
i.e., biphasic positive airway pressure (BIPAP) and bile-
vel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), delivered through
nasal prongs, facemasks, or helmets. Although there is
high-level evidence in the literature to support the use
of NPPV for the treatment of ARF due to different
causes, such as exacerbation of chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease [4] and acute cardiogenic pulmonary

edema [5] in adults, there are few reports about its use
in this acute setting in children. So far, case series con-
stitute the vast majority of the available knowledge in
this age group. However, there is an increasing interest
in the use of NPPV as a therapeutic tool for children
with respiratory distress that is clear from the increasing
number of published studies over time (Figure 1); a

sive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, noninvasive

sure ventilation, bipap, continuous positive airway pres-
sure; age limits: children from 1 month to 18 years old)
identified 332 relevant articles, of which 48% were pub-
lished during the past 5 years. This concise review is
designed to focus on the effectiveness of NPPV in chil-
dren > 1 month of age with ARF (excluding patients
with neurologic or chronic lung disease).
Acute respiratory failure in children
The frequency of ARF is higher in infants and young
children than in adults. This difference can be explained
by defining anatomic compartments and their develop-
mental differences in pediatric patients that influence
susceptibility to ARF [6]. In addition, respiratory failure
often precedes cardiopulmonary arrest in children,
unlike in adults where primary cardiac disease often is
responsible. Therefore, prompt recognition and treat-
ment of pediatric patients with pending respiratory fail-
ure can be lifesaving [6].
Respiratory failure is a syndrome in which the respira-
tory system fails in one or both of its gas exchange func-
tions: oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination. In
general, patients with respiratory failure may be classified
into two groups, depending on the component of the
respiratory system that is involved: hypoxemic respiratory
failure and hypercapnic respiratory failure [7].
Hypoxemic respiratory failure (known as type I)
Hypoxemic respiratory failure (type I) can be associated
with virtually all acute diseases of the lung, such as sta-
tus asthmaticus, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and pulmon-
ary edema, which interfere with the normal function of
the lung and airway. The predominant mechanism in
type I failure is uneven or mismatched ventilation and
perfusion (intrapulmonary shunt) in regional lung units.
This is the most common form of respiratory failure,
characterized by a PaO2 < 60 mmHg with a normal or
low PaCO2. The primary treatment of type I respiratory
failure in children is to administer supplemental oxygen
at a level sufficient to increase the arterial oxygen
saturation (SaO2) to greater than 94%. In situations
when a fraction of oxygen in inspired gas (FiO2) of
greater than 0.5 is necessary to achieve this goal, this
often is referred to as “acute hypoxemic respiratory fail-
ure” [7]. In this setting, NPPV may be considered.
Hypercapnic respiratory failure (known as type II)
Hypercapnic respiratory failure (type II) is a conse-
quence of ventilatory failure and can occur in conditions
that affect the respiratory pump, such as depressed

neural ventilatory drive, acute or chronic upper airway
obstruction, neuromuscular weakness, marked obesity,
and rib-cage abnormalities. Alveolar hypoventilation is
characterized by a PaCO2 > 50 mmHg [7]. The onset of
type II failure may be insidious and may develop when
respiratory muscle fatigue complicates preexisting disor-
ders, such as pneumonia or status asthmaticus, which
present initially with hypoxemia without hypoventila-
tion. Aministration of oxygen alone is not an appropri-
ate treatment for hypercapnic respiratory failure and can
result in the patient retaining even more carbon dioxide,
especially in situations where the child has adapted to
chronic hypercapnia and is relatively dependent on oxy-
gen-sensitive peripheral chemoreceptors to maintain
ventilatory drive. In addition to supplemental oxygen,
therapies to reduce the load on the respiratory muscles
and increase the level of alveolar ventilation should be
instituted in children with type II respiratory failure.
When to use NPPV for acute respiratory failure?
When the cause of ARF is reversible, medical treatment
works to maximize lung function and reverse the preci-
pitating cause, whereas the goal of ventilatory support is
to “gain time” by unloading respiratory muscles, increas-
ing ventilation, and thus reducing dyspnea and respira-
tory rate and improving gas exchange. Two recent
physiological studies have demonstrated these beneficial
effects of NPPV in children with ARF [8,9]. NPPV is
increasingly used for treatment of ARF in children.
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the studies reporting the
effectiveness of NPPV in children with ARF of various
etiologies [8,10-36]. However, the determinants of suc-
cess of NPPV relate more prominently to the primary
diagnosis as discussed below.
NPPV in pediatric ARF from primary respiratory
disease
Acute lower airway obstruction
Lower airway disease is a common cause of ARF.
Asthma accounts for the largest percentage of this
group, but infections, such as viral bronchiolitis, also are
common and predominantly impact the small airways.
Physicians caring for acutely ill children are regularly
faced with this condition. Both non-invasive and inva-
sive ventilation may be options when medical treatment
fails to prevent respiratory failure. ETI and positive pres-
sure ventilation in children with lower airway obstruc-
tion may increase bronchoconstriction, increase the risk
of airway leakage, and has disadvantageous effects on
circulation and cardiac output. Therefore, ETI should be
avoided unless respiratory failure is imminent despite
adequate institution of all available treatment measures.
NPPV can be an attractive alternative to IMV for these
patients. Clinical trials in children with acute lower
respiratory airway obstruction have suggested that
NPPV may improve symptoms and ventilation without
significant adverse events and reduce the need for IMV
[10-20]. NPPV theoretically improves the respiratory
status of patients with lower respiratory airway obstruc-
tion by several mechanisms [37]. During acute bronch-
ospastic episodes, patients have an increase in airway
resistance and expiratory time constant. The combina-
tion of prolonged expiratory time constant and prema-
ture closure of inflamed airways during exhalation
results in dynamic hyperinflation, which causes
increased positive pressure in the alveoli at end-expira-
tion (auto-PEEP). Because the alveolar pressure must be
reduced to subatmospheric levels to initiate the next
breath, this auto-PEEP increases the inspiratory load
and induces respiratory muscle fatigue. The EPAP deliv-
ered by NPPV may help to decrease dynamic hyperinfla-
tion by maintaining small airway patency and may
reduce the patient’s work of breathing by decreasing the
drop in alveolar pressure needed to initiate a breath. In
addition, inspiratory support, i.e., IPAP delivered by
NPPV, helps to support fatigued respiratory muscles,
thereby improving dyspnea and gas exchange. Needle-
man et al., in a physiological study, found that the
NPPV use in children with status asthmaticus was asso-
ciated with a decrease in respiratory rate and fractional
inspired time and an improvement of thoracoabdominal
synchrony in 80% of patients [12]. A few clinical studies
of small size (3-73 patients) reported the use of NPPV
for treatment of status asthmaticus in children (Table 1)
[10,11,13,14]. NPPV was well tolerated with no major
complications and was associated with an improvement
of gas exchange and respiratory effort (Table 1).
Viral bronchiolitis, mainly due to respiratory syncytial
virus, represents the largest cohort of children treated
with NPPV [15-20]. Use of NPPV in infant with severe
bronchiolitis was associated with improved respiratory
rate [15,19] and PaCO2 [16,19,20], decreased work of
breathing [17], and ETI avoidance in 67-100% of
patients (Table 1) [17,18].
Acute upper airway obstruction
In children, dynamic upper airway obstruction can pre-
sent as an acute life-threatening condition and leads to
severe alveolar hypoventilation. In 2006, a survey of
French PICU group found that 67% of pediatric intensi-
vists applied frequently or systematically NPPV in the
management of dynamic upper airway obstruction in
children [38]. However, there is a paucity of literature
on the use of NPPV in the acute setting of upper airway
obstruction in children. NPPV was associated with a sig-
nificant decrease in respiratory effort [21] and a sus-
tained improvement in gas exchange [22] in children
with dynamic upper airway obstruction (Table 1).

Parenchymal lung disease
The main goals of NPPV in patients with parenchymal
lung disease, such as pneumonia, acute lung injury
(ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
are to improve oxygenation, to unload the respiratory
muscles, and to relieve dyspnea. The first goal can
usually be achieved by using EPAP to recruit and stabi-
lize previously collapsed lung tissue [39]. Unloading of
the respiratory muscles during NPPV with IPAP has
been reported by L’Her et al. in adult patients with ALI
[39]. The authors concluded that adding IPAP to EPAP
may be indispensable in patients with ALI treated with
NPPV [39]. Indeed, IPAP allows a better respiratory sys-
tem muscle unloading, alveolar recruitment, oxygena-
tion, and CO2 washout improvement.
Although NPPV seems disappointing in ARF owing to
pneumonia in adult patients, with failure rates of up to
66% [40], several noncontrolled trials have suggested
that NPPV could improve symptoms and ventilation
without significant adverse events and reduce the need
for IMV in children with ARF due to pneumonia
[22-27]. Use of NPPV in this acute setting in children
was associated with reduction in ETI rates ranging from
50-100% (Table 1) [23,24].
The most challenging application of NPPV may be in
patients with ARDS. Studies of NPPV for the treatment
of ARDS in adult population have reported failure rates
of 50-80% [40]. A meta-analysis of the topic in adult
population concluded that NPPV was unlikely to have
any significant benefit [41]. In children, the use of
NPPV for the treatment of ARDS was associated with a
failure rate of 78%, and 22% of them died (Table 1) [27].
Therefore, NPPV use in such a patient group is rarely
justified. However, if a trial of NPPV is initiated, patients
should be closely monitored and promptly intubated if
their conditions deteriorate, so that inordinate delays in
needed interventions are avoided.
Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is one of the leading
causes of death and hospitalization among patients with
sickle cell disease [42]. Approximately 70% of patients
(adults or children) with ACS are hypoxic [43]. Indeed,
patients with sickle cell disease are prone to infarctive
crises. Thoracic bone infarction (usually in the ribs) in
such patients leads to pain, splinting, hypoventilation,
and the clinical signs of ACS. In situ red blood cell sick-
ling in the lung vasculature is possibly a consequence of
hypoventilation with subsequent infarction of lung par-
enchyma. NPPV has been proposed as a therapeutic
option for patients with ACS. By improving patient oxy-
genation, NPPV could prevent progression from painful
crisis to ACS, and ultimately to ARDS. Three retrospec-
tive studies reported favorable outcomes in children
with ACS treated with NPPV (Table 1) [22,27,28].
NPPV in specific circumstances
Postoperative respiratory failure
Postoperative pulmonary complications are a major
cause of morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stay,
and increased cost of care [44]. It has been reported
that 5-10% of all surgical adult patients experience post-
operative pulmonary complications [45]. Atelectasis,
postoperative pneumonia, ARDS, and postoperative
respiratory failure have all been classified as postopera-
tive pulmonary complications. Postoperative respiratory

failure is most commonly defined as the inability to be
extubated 48 hours after surgery [46], although some
investigators have used 5 days [47]. NPPV has been suc-
cessfully used to treat postoperative respiratory failure
in both pediatric and adult patients. Compared with
standard treatment, NPPV used after major abdominal
surgery improved hypoxemia and reduced the need for
ETI in adult population [48]. NPPV application in chil-
dren with postoperative respiratory failure was asso-
ciated with improved respiratory effort, gas exchange,
oxygen saturation, and reduced the need for ETI (Table
1) [8,24,26,27,29,30].
Facilitation of ventilation weaning/rescue of failed
extubation
The need for reintubation after failed extubation is asso-
ciated with increased morbidity and high mortality [49].
NPPV has been proposed as a means of “facilitating”
weaning from IMV, and as a “curative” treatment for
postextubation respiratory failure. Although several stu-
dies have shown the efficacy of NPPV in weaning from
IMV in adult population [50], its application for postex-
tubation respiratory failure is not supported by rando-
mized, controlled trials [51]. In children, two
noncontrolled trials assessed the efficacy of NPPV in
these settings: the application of NPPV as a means of
“facilitating” ventilation weaning, and as “curative” treat-
ment for postextubation respiratory failure was asso-
ciated with success rates of 81-86% and 50-75%,
respectively [31,32].
Immunocompromised children
ARF in immunocompromised patients most often
results from infections, pulmonary localization of the
primary disease, or even postchemotherapy cardiogenic
pulmonary edema. Treatment of such patients often
requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. Avoid-
ance of the infectious complications associated with
IMV is particularly attractive in these high-risk patients,
in whom this could be devastating, if not fatal. Results
of randomized, controlled trials have proven the benefi-
cial effects of NPPV in immunocompromised adult
patients [52,53]. Some case series reported the use of
NPPV in the treatment of respiratory failure in immu-
nocompromised children (Table 2) [23,27,33-36]. The
likelihood of NPPV success in immunocompromised
children seems to be related rather to the type of pul-
monary disease: the ETI avoidance rates varied from
40% for ARDS to 100% for pneumonia (Table 2).
Are there predictive factors of NPPV failure in
children with ARF?
It is not always apparent which patients will initially
benefit from NPPV; some patients do not obtain ade-
quate ventilation with NPPV. The NPPV failure rate
may be fairly consistent for certain diseases, and NPPV
failure eventually requires intubation. Inability to early
identify patients who will fail NPPV can cause inap-
propriate delay of intubation, which can cause clinical
deterioration and increase morbidity and mortality.
Knowing the predictors of NPPV failure in patient with
ARF is therefore crucial in deciding if and when to
apply this ventilatory technique. Several authors have
identified different predictive factors of NPPV failure in
children with ARF: the results of studies are given in
Table 3[20,24,26,27,31,54,55]. The best predictive factors
for the NPPV failure in ARF appear to be the level of
FiO2 and PaCO2 on admission or within the first hours
after starting NPPV (Table 3).
Conclusions
During recent years, there has been an increasing inter-
est in the use of NPPV for children with ARF. There are
some promising studies supporting its use in this acute
setting. NPPV was well tolerated with rare major com-
plications and was associated with improved gas

exchange, decreased work of breathing, and decreased
need for ETI. Both critical care ventilators and portable
ventilators have been used for NPPV. However, the vast
majority of the available knowledge in this acute setting
results from noncontrolled trials and case series of small
size. As such, many important issues, such as the identi-
fication of the patient, the right time for NPPV applica-
tion, and the appropriate setting, are still lacking.
Further randomized, controlled trials addressing these
issues in children with ARF are needed to define better
the patients who are likely to benefit from this alterna-
tive method of respiratory support. Also, the respective
place of NPPV and high flow oxygen therapy in children
with ARF due to different conditions has to be deter-
mined [56].
