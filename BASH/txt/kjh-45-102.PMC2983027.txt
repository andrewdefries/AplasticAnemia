Background
A combination of busulfan (Bu) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) has been used as a standard
myeloablative regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Recent studies postulate that fludarabine (Flu) is a less toxic substitute for Cy.
Methods
Forty-two patients who were diagnosed with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syn-
drome and received BuFlu (n=17) or BuCy (n=25) from August, 1999 to July, 2009 at
Dong-A University Medical Center were retrospectively analyzed.
Results
The median follow-up duration was 39.75 months. The BuFlu group showed a lower in-
cidence of mucositis (P=0.005), but there was no significant intergroup difference in the
time of engraftment, nausea/vomiting, acute/chronic graft-versus-host disease, hepatic
veno-occlusive disease, or hemorrhagic cystitis. Moreover, the 2 groups showed no sig-
nificant difference in the cumulative risk of relapse, event-free survival, or overall survival.
Conclusion
BuFlu administration can be employed as a preparative regimen for allogeneic HSCT and
shows efficacy and transplant-adverse effects comparable to those of BuCy. However,
randomized prospective studies in more patients are warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Since the early 1980s, busulfan (Bu) has been recognized
as an effective pretransplant agent in lieu of total body irradi-
ation in the conditioning therapy for allogeneic hema-
topoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Thus, both oral
and intravenous (i.v.) forms of Bu have been used in combina-
tion with cyclophosphamide (Cy), and this combination has
become a standard myeloablative regimen for allogeneic
HSCT [1, 2]. However, these commonly used transplant prep-
arative regimens cause a spectrum of acute and chronic tox-
icities: nausea/vomiting, oral mucositis, enteritis, hepatic ve-
no-occlusive disease (HVOD), acute graft-versus-host disease
(aGVHD), and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) [3]. Both the por-
to-hepatic metabolism of oral Bu [4] and the specific metabo-
lite of Cy [5] are highly associated with HVOD, increased
treatment-related mortality (TRM), and morbidity. Howev-
er, i.v. Bu administration is associated with a significantly
lower incidence of HVOD because of the predictable bio-
availability in this route of administration and the circum-
vention of the first-pass effect of oral administration [6].
Fludarabine (Flu), a purine analog, has been shown to
be active against a variety of hematologic malignancies [7].
In addition, by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation, Flu pro-
vides sufficient immunosuppression to prevent graft rejec-

tion. In the light of its established characteristics and non-
hematological toxicities, Flu has been used in nonmyelo-
ablative transplant settings [8]. Some studies have shown
that the use of Flu in reduced-intensity conditioning regi-
mens enabled engraftment, promoted the graft-versus-leuke-
mia effect, and was well tolerated by the patients [9-11].
Flu has also been combined with myeloablative doses of
Bu (BuFlu) [12-14], and this combination showed a lower
rate of complications, successful engraftment, and efficacy
in patients with a high risk of leukemia and in middle-aged
patients with related and unrelated allogeneic HSCT.
Available retrospective data comparing BuFlu with BuCy
suggest that BuFlu is safe and at least as effective as BuCy
for patients who have myelogenous malignancies and are
undergoing HSCT [15, 16].
In this study, we have retrospectively analyzed patients
who had acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
and underwent allogeneic HSCT after myeloablative con-
ditioning regimens using BuFlu. We compared the data of
these patients with those who received the traditional BuCy
regimen to compare their toxicity profiles, treatment out-
comes, and overall survival (OS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
From August, 1999 to July, 2009, 42 patients who were
diagnosed with acute leukemia or MDS underwent HLA-
identical allogeneic HSCT at Dong-A University Medical
Center. The findings for 15 patients who received oral BuCy
and 10 patients who received i.v. BuCy were compared to
those for 17 consecutive patients who were treated with
the myeloablative BuFlu regimen. All patients were retro-
spectively analyzed by reviewing their medical records. We
have excluded patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or
aplastic anemia because they had better clinical outcomes
than patients with acute leukemia or MDS after allogeneic
HSCT.
1. Pretransplant regimen
In the BuCy group, oral Bu (Myran, Korea United Pharm.,
Chungnam, Republic of Korea, 1 mg/kg) or i.v. Bu (Busulfex,
Ben Venue Laboratories Inc., Bedford, Ohio, USA, 0.8 mg/kg)
was administered every 6 hours for 4 days (days -7 to -4),
followed by i.v. Cy (60 mg/kg) for 2 days (days -3 to -2).
The chemotherapy doses were based on the ideal body weight
(IBW), except in the patients whose real body weight (RBW)
exceeded their IBW by more than 20%; in such cases, the
doses were based on an adjusted IBW, which was calculated
as IBW + (0.25 (RBW - IBW)).
In the BuFlu group, i.v. Flu (Fludara, BaxterOncology
GmbH, Westfalen, Germany) was administered at a dose
of 40 mg/m2
over 30 min for 4 days (total, 160 mg/m
2
,
days -6 to -3) along with i.v. Bu at a dose of 130 mg/m2
over 3 hours for 4 days (total, 520 mg/m2
, days -6 to -3).
2. GVHD prophylaxis and supportive care
The aGVHD prophylaxis consisted of methotrexate and
cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A administration was started at
a dose of 1.5 mg/kg i.v. over 3 hours q 12 hours from days
-1 to +14 and then changed to the oral form at a dosage
of 4-6 mg/kg bid adjusted after therapeutic drug monitoring
at a level of 200-400 ng/mL. Patients with unrelated donors
in the BuFlu group received rabbit-ATG (Thymoglobulin,
IMTIX-SANGSTAT, Lyon, France) at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg
i.v. from days -3 to -1. Methotrexate was administered at
doses of 15 mg/m2
on day +1 and 10 mg/m2
on days +3,
+6, and +11. The last dose of methotrexate was omitted
when mucositis (≥grade 4) or renal impairment was
observed. Phenytoin was administered during and 1 day
after i.v. Bu-based therapy. Allogeneic donor hematopoietic
stem cells were infused using the standard infusion technique
on day 0.
Infection prophylaxis consisted of a combination of cipro-
floxacin (500 mg p.o. bid), fluconazole (100 mg/day p.o.
qd), acyclovir (250 mg/m2
i.v. q 8 hours), and sulfamethox-
azole-trimethoprim (960 mg p.o. 3 times a week); this pro-
phylaxis began with the initiation of conditioning.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (100 mg p.o. tid) and heparin (100
units/kg/day i.v. continuously) were used for HVOD prophy-
laxis, which also began with the initiation of the conditioning
therapy. A CMV antigenemia assay was performed every
week until day +100, every 2 weeks until 6 months, and
every 2 or 4 weeks until 12 months after engraftment.
3. Definitions
Successful neutrophil engraftment was defined as the first
of 2 consecutive days with an absolute neutrophil count
≥0.5×109
/L. Failure to engraft in the absence of malignancy
by day +30 was considered primary engraftment failure.
Secondary graft failure was defined as initially successful
engraftment with documented donor-derived hematopoiesis
followed by loss of graft function without recurrent malig-
nancy. Platelet engraftment was defined as the first of 7
consecutive days with a platelet count ≥20×109
/L without
transfusion.
aGVHD was defined as described by Przepiorka et al.
[17], and cGVHD was defined as described by the “Revised
Seattle Criteria” [18]. HVOD was graded according to the
criteria by McDonald et al. [19]. Toxicity was scored using
the modified National Cancer Institute criteria (CTC 3.0).
The event-free survival (EFS) time was defined as the time
from transplantation to relapse or death, and the OS was
defined as the number of days from transplantation until
death from any cause; in contrast, non-relapse mortality
(NRM) was defined as death from any cause other than
disease relapse.
4. Statistical analysis
Categorical variables and continuous variables were com-
pared by Fisher’s exact test and t test, respectively. OS and
EFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit
method. Cumulative incidence of relapse was estimated by

Gray’s test. The Cox proportional hazard regression model
was employed in univariate and multivariate analyses of
OS and EFS. Calculation of adjusted P-values was performed
by the backward selection method. This study was essentially
explorative in nature, and therefore, no adjustment for multi-
ple testing was applied, and P-values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses
were performed using SAS 9.1.3 and R 2.9.1 statistical
software.
RESULTS
1. Patient characteristics
Among the 42 patients who were analyzed in this study,
25 received BuCy and 17 received BuFlu as preparative con-
ditioning therapy. Baseline patient characteristics are listed
in Table 1. The median patient age was 34 years (range,
17-56 years). All recipients were matched with HLA-identi-
cal donors, among whom 6 donors (14%) were unrelated.
Twenty-eight patients underwent bone marrow trans-
plantation (BMT). Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
(PBSCT) was conducted in 14 patients. The mean number
of infused total nucleated cells (TNCs)/kg, mononucleated
cells (MNCs)/kg, and CD34+ stem cells/kg were 6.46±3.61
(×108
)/kg, 3.05±3.34 (×108
)/kg, and 3.95±2.75 (×106
)/kg,
respectively. The median follow-up duration was 39.75
months (range, 2.70-127.10 months). There were no inter-
group differences in age, sex, disease types of the recipients,
ABO incompatibility status, or number of infused CD34+
stem cells. However, stem cell sources (P＜0.001), donor
types (P=0.002), and total number of infused stem cells
(TNCs, P=0.007; MNCs, P=0.001) showed statistically sig-
nificant differences. All patients in the BuCy group received
stem cells from sibling donors and were infused with 4.35±
1.31 (×108
/kg) TNCs and 0.89±0.50 (×108
/kg) MNCs.
However, in the BuFlu group, 6 patients received stem cells
from unrelated donors, and the remaining 11 patients re-
ceived stem cells from sibling donors; 14 patients underwent
PBSCT, and 3 patients received BMT. Among the 6 patients
who underwent HSCT from unrelated donors, 3 patients
each underwent PBSCT and BMT. Patients in the BuFlu
group were infused with TNCs [mean, 9.96±3.51 (×108
/kg)]
and MNCs [mean, 6.76±2.82 (×108
/kg)].
2. Engraftment
All 42 patients receiving BuCy or BuFlu showed successful
engraftment (Table 2). No primary engraftment failure or
secondary graft failure was observed in either group. There
were no statistically significant intergroup differences in the
time to neutrophil engraftment (14.0 vs. 15.0 days, P=0.968)
or platelet engraftment (13.0 vs. 17.0 days, P=0.233) after
transplantation.
3. Toxicity profile
1) Hepatic veno-occlusive disease
Four cases of HVOD were observed in the BuCy group.
Among these, 3 patients, including 1 patient who showed
moderate HVOD, were treated with oral Bu. In the BuFlu
group, 1 patient experienced mild HVOD. There was no
significant difference between the number of HVOD cases
in the 2 groups (P=0.632).
2) Acute and chronic GVHD
aGVHD developed in 8 patients (32%) in the BuCy group.
Among these, 6 patients (75%) showed grade 1 aGVHD
and 2 patients treated with oral Bu showed grade 3 aGVHD.
Three patients (18%) showed aGVHD in the BuFlu group.
In this group, 2 patients showed grade 1 aGVHD and 1
patient showed grade 2 aGVHD. There was no statistically
significant difference between the number of cases of aGVHD
in the 2 groups (P=0.477). There were no cases of grade
4 aGVHD in the 2 groups.
cGVHD developed in 5 patients (20%) in the BuCy group
and in 7 patients (41%) in the BuFlu group. Extensive cGVHD
developed in 2 patients in the BuFlu group, but no patient
showed extensive disease in the BuCy group. There was
no significant difference between the number of cases of

All patients experienced nausea, vomiting, and mucositis.
Twenty patients (80%) in the BuCy group and 10 (59%)
patients in the BuFlu group showed grade 2-4 nausea/
vomiting. Among the 20 patients in the BuCy group, 17
were treated with oral Bu. There was no significant difference
between the incidence of these symptoms in the 2 groups
(P=0.174).
Grade 2-4 mucositis developed in 17 patients (68%) in
the BuCy group and in 4 patients (24%) in the BuFlu group.
There was a significant difference between the number of
cases showing mucositis in the 2 groups (P=0.005).
4. Hemorrhagic cystitis
Hemorrhagic cystitis developed in 3 patients (12%) in
the BuCy group and in 3 patients (18%) in the BuFlu group.
There was no significant difference between the 2 groups
(P=0.672).
5. CMV infection
　CMV antigenemia was detected in 5 patients (20%) in
the BuCy group and in 4 patients (24%) in the BuFlu group.
Two patients in the BuFlu group experienced CMV pneu-
monia. There was no significant difference in the occurrence
of CMV antigenemia between the 2 groups (P=0.537).
6. Non-relapse mortality
　Three patients (7%) died for reasons not related to relapsed
or refractory disease. All of these patients were treated with
the BuFlu regimen and diagnosed with MDS. One patient
died of septic shock due to delayed hospital arrival, and
2 patients died of CMV pneumonia.
7. Relapse
　Among the patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT,
13 (31%) relapsed; 9 (36%) patients were treated with BuCy
and 4 (24%) with BuFlu. The cumulative risk of relapse
at 12 months and 24 months after transplantation were re-
spectively 36% (s.e.=10%) and 36% (s.e.=10%) in the BuCy
group and 21% (s.e.=11%) and 30% (s.e.=14%) in the BuFlu
group (Table 3). No significant difference in the cumulative
risk of relapse was observed between the 2 groups (P=0.47)
(Fig. 1).
8. Survival
　There were no significant intergroup differences in OS
and EFS (P=0.86 and P=0.79, respectively) (Fig. 2). In the
BuCy group, the 3-year OS and EFS were 64% (s.e.=10%)
and 64% (s.e.=10%), respectively. In the BuFlu group, the
3-year OS and EFS were 58% (s.e.=13%) and 55% (s.e.=
13%), respectively. In the univariate analysis, none of the
variables was found to affect OS and EFS. The multivariate
analysis showed that the TNC count was associated with
good OS and EFS (HR=0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.88; P=0.009
and HR=0.69; 95% CI, 0.50-0.96; P=0.026, respectively),
whereas the CD34+ cell count was marginally associated
with poor OS (HR=1.34; 95% CI, 1.01-1.78; P=0.045). The

DISCUSSION
The combination regimen of oral and i.v. Bu and Cy has
been widely accepted as a standard preparative conditioning
therapy in allogeneic HSCT. However, the highly cytotoxic
effects elicited by combining these 2 alkylating drugs increase
the TRM and morbidity in patients who undergo this
regimen. The cytotoxicity of Cy is putatively caused by the
initial conversion of Cy to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide
(HCY), a circulating metabolite that is thought to enter the
target cells. This conversion reaction is catalyzed by perox-
idases and cytochrome P450. Exposure to HCY is modulated
by Bu and/or phenytoin, and individuals may show sub-
stantial variability in exposure to HCY at a given dose of
Cy [20]. Therefore, the cytotoxicity of the BuCy conditioning
regimen affects single or multiple organs and ranges from
mild to severe, eventually threatening the patients’ lives.
Moreover, oral Bu administration in combination with Cy
has been associated with HVOD. Additionally, oral Bu ad-
ministration is associated with a hepatic first-pass extraction
effect that can result in high local Bu concentrations in
the portal-hepatic venous system, which may conceivably
contribute to the development of HVOD [21].
　To alleviate the oral Bu and Cy toxicities, i.v. Bu for-
mulation and an alternative immunosuppressive agent by-
passing the hepatic metabolism, that is, replacing Cy with
a nucleoside analog, was introduced [21]. We changed the
conditioning regimen at our institution to decrease the tox-
icity and increase the convenience of treatment because the
long half-life of Flu allows once-daily administration.
　Flu performs an immunosuppressive role, thereby creating
an environment that promotes donor stem cell engraftment.
Moreover, Flu indirectly but synergistically enhances Bu-in-
duced cytotoxicity by interfering with the repair of radiation
therapy (XRT)- and alkylator-induced DNA damage [7].
However, the superiority of the BuFlu (compared to the
BuCy) conditioning regimen in terms of the disease relapse
rate remains controversial because a lower incidence of tox-
icity implies lesser cytotoxic effects of the drug.
　In our study, patients who were treated with the BuFlu
regimen conclusively benefited from the treatment with re-
gard to their oral mucositis grade. However, 15 patients
(60%) in the BuCy group received oral Bu, but all patients
in the BuFlu group received i.v. Bu. This difference may
affect the statistical significance because of the unpredictable
and erratic bioavailability of the orally administered drug.
　Although the number of patients was too small to general-
ize the results of our study, the BuFlu group showed a ten-
dency of faster platelet engraftment and lower tendencies
to develop HVOD, grade 2-4 aGVHD, nausea, and vomiting
in comparison with the corresponding values for the BuCy
group. The relatively shorter time to platelet engraftment
in the BuFlu group could be attributed to Flu itself, which
has less cytotoxic and similar immunosuppressive effects than
Cy, thereby allowing more easy incorporation of the donor’s
stem cells into the recipients’ bone marrow. However, most
of the analyzed patients in the BuFlu group received stem
cells from peripheral blood, which may have partially con-
tributed to the rapid engraftment. As mentioned above,
aGVHD and HVOD primarily occur due to the tissue damage
Korean J Hematol 2010;45:102-8.
BuFlu vs. BuCy for stem cell transplantation 107
caused by cytotoxic agents used in preparative conditioning
regimens. Flu has a less direct toxic effect on the host environ-
ment, thereby lowering TRM and morbidity. However, more
patients in the BuFlu group experienced cGVHD. This might
have been due to the peripheral blood stem cells, which
comprised the most significant stem cell source in this group.
PBSCT has a higher incidence of cGVHD because the number
of T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood is more than that
in the bone marrow [22].
　In this study, both the BuCy and BuFlu groups showed
similar rates of CMV antigenemia. Nevertheless, the patients
in the BuFlu group showed a higher, although not significant,
incidence of overt CMV disease, thereby resulting in a higher
incidence of non-relapse mortality in this group. Although
the number of patients was too small to generalize our results,
Flu could be more immunosuppressive than Cy when in-
corporated into a conditioning regimen with Bu, thereby
necessitating more caution with respect to serious infections.
　The lower cytotoxicity of Flu could imply a lower anti-
tumor effect, which might induce a higher relapse rate and
shorter survival time. In our study, patients in both groups
showed no difference in disease recurrence or OS, as had
been demonstrated in several studies using BuFlu [12-14].
Although these results are not conclusive because of the
small number of patients analyzed and the shorter follow-up
duration in the BuFlu group, we concluded that Flu combined
with Bu could be an effective conditioning regimen, in lieu
of the BuCy regimen, with fewer adverse events.
　In this study, we used a sequential infusion regimen of
Flu and Bu for 4 days [12]. Various doses of Flu have been
used in the BuFlu regimen for reduced-intensity or myeloa-
blative conditioning. Although some controversies exist, the
doses of Flu for myeloablative conditioning range from 120
to 250 mg/m2
[12-14]. A higher dose of Flu results in a
lower occurrence rate of GVHD but a longer time to engraft-
ment [12, 14, 23]. However, the optimal sequence, infusion
timing, or doses of Bu and Flu for a myeloablative condition-
ing regimen have not been established yet.
　In conclusion, the only significant benefit of the BuFlu
regimen was the lower incidence of oral mucositis. There
was no significant intergroup difference in the toxicity pro-
files, including the incidence of HVOD, aGVHD, cGVHD,
nausea/vomiting, hemorrhagic cystitis, or CMV antigenemia,
although patients in the BuFlu group tended to show shorter
platelet engraftment times and lower incidence of HVOD,
aGVHD, and nausea/vomiting. We observed no significant
difference in the EFS and OS of the 2 groups. Patients in
the BuFlu group showed a tendency toward a higher in-
cidence of severe CMV infections. Thus, Flu combined with
Bu could be incorporated in a myeloablative conditioning
regimen for allogeneic HSCT with an efficacy similar to
that of Cy combined with Bu, but more caution is needed
because the combination of Flu and Bu can induce fatal
infections. Nevertheless, the results of our study have limited
reliability in establishing a general consensus. First, the num-
ber of patients was too small, and the baseline donor stem
cell types and sources of stem cells showed significant differ-
ences between the 2 groups. Second, Flu could have different
pharmacokinetics, consequently resulting in different effi-
cacies in various diseases. Third, and of primary concern,
the different conditioning regimens were administered se-
quentially - oral BuCy was administered from 1999-2002,
i.v. BuCy from 2002-2005, and BuFlu from 2005-2009, there-
by resulting in different follow-up durations and “period
effects” between the groups. The difference in the treatment
time can affect the therapeutic results by confounding varia-
bles unrelated to the preparative conditioning regimen.
Fourth, a selection bias exists in our study; all patients who
had been treated with BuCy underwent allogeneic HSCT
with related donor bone marrow; in contrast, most patients
in the BuFlu group received peripheral blood stem cells.
In addition, some patients in the BuFlu group received un-
related donor stem cells. Thus, randomized prospective stud-
ies in large populations comparing the BuCy and BuFlu regi-
mens are needed.
