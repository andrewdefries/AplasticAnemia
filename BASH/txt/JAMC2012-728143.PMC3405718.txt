Passive samplers have been widely used for volatile organic compounds determination. Following the green chemistry tendency of
the direct determination of adsorbed compounds in membrane-based devices through using head space direct chromatography
analysis, this work has evaluated the use of Amberlite XAD-2, XAD-4, and XAD-16 adsorbents as a ﬁlling material for passive
samplers. Direct analysis of the membranes by HS-GC-MS involves a solvent-free method avoiding any sample treatment. For
exposed membranes, recoveries ranged from 10% to 203%, depending on the compound and adsorbent used. The limit of the
detection values ranged from 1 to 140 ng per sampler. Acceptable precision and sensitivity levels were obtained for the XAD resins
assayed.
1. Introduction
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a wide group of
chemicals, which can be emitted to the atmosphere from
diﬀerent sources [1]. Toxicity of some of them has been
reported during the last years, with some VOCs classiﬁed
as harmful compounds to human health [2, 3]. These com-
pounds have a potential role in the formation of photooxi-
dants and they can be considered as the reason for olfactory
pollution [4]. In the case of benzene, this compound exhibits
a cancer risk and causes aplastic anemia and polycythemia,
with toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes being important
noncarcinogenic agents [5]. On the other hand, the VOCs
and specially those halogenated compounds contribute to
global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion and tro-
pospheric ozone formation. Therefore, it is important to
establish a control and to monitor the air concentration of
VOCs in both working areas and private places.
Air sampling techniques commonly used to evaluate the
quality of indoor and outdoor air are based on the use of
active or passive samplers, with low-ﬂow active ones being
also used in order to evaluate long-term deploying times.
In general, active samplers provide direct measurements of
the concentration of contaminants per m3. However, their
use is costly and involves complex sampling systems due to
the use of pumps when passive samplers oﬀer cheap and
easy alternatives [7, 8]. Passive samplers are commonly used
for the determination of VOCs in air [9], with the semi-
permeable membrane devices (SPMDs) being one of the
most used among them [8]. SPMDs consist of low-density
polyethylene (LDPE) lay-ﬂat tube ﬁlled with triolein and
sealed at both ends and have been used as an adsorbent of
hydrophobic compounds in water and air. Our research team
developed a modiﬁed version of these passive samplers, in
which triolein was substituted by a solid phase or a combina-
tion of solid phases introduced inside a semipermeable mem-
brane, thus improving the SPMD sampling range, due to
their ability for retaining a wide range of compounds with
diﬀerent physicochemical properties [10]. These devices
were registered under the name of Versatile, Easy, and Rapid
Atmospheric Monitors (VERAM), and previous results
obtained with a solid ﬁlling of activated carbon and ﬂorisil
were successfully applied to diﬀerent studies of sampling
and analysis of air quality, with several compounds being
determined such as pyrethroids, VOCs, or pesticides [3, 11–
13]. Determination of VOCs using VERAM devices and

analysis of samples through head space gas chromatography
with mass spectrometry detection (HS-GC-MS) could be
considered as a green method since it involves a solvent-free
sample manipulation and direct determination, thus avoid-
ing the accumulation of toxics residues and the consequent
environmental side-eﬀects [14]. However, additional eﬀorts
are required to increase the capability of these devices as
chemical catchers based on the use of alternative adsorbents
and membranes.
The aim of the present work has been to use Amberlite
XAD resins to ﬁlling LDPE membranes, in order to compare
the possible advantages in front of the classical VERAM
samplers. XAD resins are hydrophobic nonionic crosslinked
polymers provided as white beads, which are widely used to
adsorb organic compounds as it can be seen in the inset of
Figure 1. These resins have been applied as XAD-based pas-
sive samplers for routing air monitoring of persistent organic
pollutants (POPs) and other semivolatile organic com-
pounds (SVOCs) [15]. Depending on their physicochemical
properties, such as surface area or pore diameter, XAD resins
can modify their adsorption properties (see Table 1), and
Lee et al. made a comparison between XAD-2, XAD-4, and
XAD-16 resins for the retention of vapour-phase PAHs [16].
Therefore, this study has been focused on the use of
XAD-2, XAD-4, and XAD-16 adsorbents as alternative ﬁlling
materials of VERAM devices, comparing the results found
with the previous ones obtained with activated carbon and
ﬂorisil (ACFL).
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Chemicals. Studied VOC standards and hexadecane
were obtained from Scharlau (Barcelona, Spain), Fluka
Chemie (Steinheim, Germany), Merck (Darmstadt, Ger-
many), and Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Working stan-
dard solutions were prepared by dilution of a stock solu-
tion (3.85% (w/w) VOCs standard stock solution prepared
by mixing 1 g of all considered analytes) in hexadecane.
Hexadecane was employed due to its high boiling point.
Activated carbon from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain), Florisil
from Acros (Geel, Belgium), and Amberlite XAD-2, XAD-
4, and XAD-16 from Sigma Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany),
were employed as solid phases for adsorption studies. 2.85 ±
0.01 L volume glass containers employed were appropriately
decontaminated and cleaned up using a 5 min nitrogen
ﬂow before being used. Table 2 shows the list of studied
compounds as well as their measurement parameters.

Polaris Q ion trap mass spectrometer detector was used for
VOCs determination. Glass vials with an internal volume of
10 mL, capped with PTFE/butyl rubber seals, were employed
for HS measurements. LPDE lay-ﬂat tubing, 2,9 cm wide, was
obtained from Garci-plast (Barcelona, Spain), and Rovebloc
sealer (Barcelona, Spain) was employed to heat-seal the
membranes.
2.3. Preparation of Samplers. Preparation of samplers was
carried out according to previous published method [3].
LDPE lay-ﬂat tubing was cut into 10 cm segments. The seg-
ments were cleaned in hexane overnight and air-dried. One
end was heat sealed before introducing the corresponding
ﬁlling: 50 mg of Amberlite XAD-2; 50 mg of Amberlite XAD-
4; 50 mg of Amberlite XAD-16; or 50 mg of ﬂorisil and 5 mg
of activated carbon.
XAD resins were soaked in deionized water/acetone
(1 : 1) for 10 min inside an ultrasound water bath, followed
by acetone soaking and drying. Then the adsorbents were
soaked in dichloromethane/acetone (1 : 1) for another 10
minutes, mesh-sieved, and thoroughly dried.
Furthermore, all solid phases were heated up to 145◦
C for
two hours to reduce the amount of VOC contamination.
The ﬁlled membranes were wrapped in separate alu-
minium foils and stored in a closed vessel at −20◦
C to
avoid their contamination before use. After deployment, the
devices were rolled, placed inside 10 mL HS vials, capped
hermetically with PTFE/butyl rubber seals, and stored at
−20◦
C until the HS-GC-MS measurement.
Calibration curves were obtained from membranes
spiked with 5 µL of VOC hexadecane standard solutions at 7
concentration levels ranging from 15 ng to 1500 ng together
with 1500 ng of d8-toluene and 1500 ng of d12-cyclohexane
as internal standards.
2.4. Adsorption Studies. Adsorption studies were performed
by deploying membranes ﬁlled with XAD-2, XAD-4,

Sampling was done at room temperature for 72 h. Blank
measurements were carried out in the same way by deploying
each membrane inside glass bottles for 72 h without adding
VOCs. All the deployments were done by triplicate.
After exposure, membranes were transferred into 10 mL

of d12-cyclohexane, both of them prepared in hexadecane,
vials were hermetically capped.

and to determine the recovery percentage of each considered
compound. These membranes were directly introduced into
the HS vials after adding 1500 ng of d8-toluene and 1500 ng
of d12-cyclohexane as internal standards.
2.6. HS-GC-MS Direct Determination. Desorption of VOCs
was carried out at 145◦
C during 10 min, with a syringe
temperature of 145◦
C. A volume of 0,1 mL was then injected
into the GC (split 1 : 8) at 200◦
C. Helium (99,99% purity)
was used as carrier gas with a constant ﬂow of 1,3 mL/min.
Initial temperature of GC oven was set at 40◦
C and held
for 8 min, then it was increased 20◦
C min−1 up to 200◦
C,
and ﬁnally held for 2 min. Transfer line and ion source
temperatures were 280 and 250◦
C, respectively. Detection
was done in Full Scan mode ranging from 40 to 260 m/z with
an electron impact ionization of 70 eV.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. The Inﬂuence of Adsorbents on VOCs HS-GC-MS Deter-
mination. In order to check the response of XAD resins
under chromatography conditions, membranes ﬁlled with
XAD-2, XAD-4, and XAD-16 were spiked with 150 ng of
VOCs standard mixture and were analysed by HS-GC-MS.
After blank correction, results found were compared with
those obtained with active carbon-ﬂorisil classical VERAM
samplers (see Figure 2). Analytical response of most of the
compounds desorbed from XAD resins is similar to that
obtained from ACFL ﬁlled samplers, which suggests a similar
behaviour of resins under chromatography conditions. The
direct measurement of VOCs solutions through HS-GC-
MS is also indicated in the ﬁgure for comparative purposes
regarding the capability of the membranes to retain VOCs in
the selected measurement conditions.

Figure 3 shows peak identiﬁcation for all the considered
compounds in the total ion chromatogram obtained from a
membrane ﬁlled with XAD-2 spiked with VOCs, and from it
the easy identiﬁcation of all compounds can be appreciated.
The chromatogram obtained for a passive sampler blank
clearly shows that Amberlite adsorbents can be alternative
solid phases for VERAM devices.
3.2. The Capability of XAD for VOCs Adsorption. As said
before, adsorbent materials can retain a certain range of
compounds depending on their properties. Tests of XAD
adsorption were carried out in order to evaluate the capa-
bility of the resins for extraction VOCs from air as LDPE
membrane ﬁllings. Figure 4 shows the relative adsorption for
all the compounds under study of XAD-2, XAD-4, and XAD-
16 samplers exposed during 72 h, and after blank corrections
most of the compounds present a similar response.
As can be observed in Table 3, most of the recovery results
obtained from Amberlite resins are similar to the well-known
carbon ACFL ﬁlled samplers, ranging from 10% to 203% for
XAD adsorbents. Recovery percentages were calculated by
triplicate by comparison of signals obtained from deployed
membranes for 72 h with the responses corresponding to
spiked membranes.
3.3. Analytical Figures of Merit. Table 4 shows analytical
parameters obtained for the determination of VOCs by
HS-GC-MS after retention in LDPE membranes ﬁlled with
diﬀerent adsorbents. Precision of the method was evaluated
from RSD values, with results lower than 22% in all cases for
3 independent determinations. Limits of detection of XAD
resins were calculated as follows: LOD = 3 Sblank/b, where b
is the slope of the calibration curve and Sblank is the standard
deviation (SD) of 3 independent measurements of a passive
sampler spiked with 15 ng of VOCs and were compared with
those obtained for VERAM samplers in previous studies [3].
The slope of the calibration curve, b, gives the sensibility of
the method for each compound. XAD-2 shows best limits
of detection among the resins ranging from 1 to 140 ng per
sampler.
4. Conclusions
Amberlite XAD-2, XAD-4, and XAD-16 are alternative ﬁlling
materials for LPDE-based passive samplers in order to do
VOCs determination. Results obtained in this preliminary
study evidence similar adsorption properties for Amberlite
resins than for ACFL-ﬁlled membranes, which have been
widely used with success in the past but providing very
low limit of detection values. Although XAD-2 seems to
show better analytical parameters, VOCs adsorption results
obtained for amberlite resins are similar for all of them, and
it could be used in future studies.
