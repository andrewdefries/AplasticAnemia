We have developed methods for the short-term culture of tumour
tissue taken at surgery from patients with cancer of lung, ovary and
other sites. The challenge of this work is to determine how to identify in
vitro characteristics of the tumour that might be useful for treatment
decisions. We used 96-well agarose-coated plates for culture, an
incubation time of 7 days and 3H-thymidine incorporation as a measure
of proliferation. Culture doubling times, estimated from the reduction in
S-phase cells following exposure to paclitaxel, varied upwards from 2.5
days with a median of 4.5 days. We compared dose-response curves
of primary cultures and of several established cell lines using cisplatin,
carboplatin, doxorubicin, etoposide, hydroperoxycyclophosphamide
and an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
receptor kinase. IC50 values (drug concentrations required for 50%
inhibition of incorporation) for the EGFR inhibitor clearly delineated
cultures into sensitive and resistant categories. ICsc values for the DNA
damaging drugs identified cultures that were apparently much more
sensitive to a number of drugs than were any of the established cell
lines. This was true even when values were corrected for doubling
times, which were generally longer for primary cultures than for cell
lines. It appears that cultures showing apparent sensitivity respond to
small amounts of DNA damage either by induction of apoptosis or by
sustained arrest in G.- or G2-phase. Such behaviour might rely on
check-point and other responses that are reduced or lost during the
development of established cell lines. Studies of responses of primary
cultures may thus not only provide kinetic data of use to the choice of
treatment, but might also provide information relevant to the
development of new therapeutic approaches to cancer treatment.

P3 THYMIDYLATE SYNTHASE EXPRESSION IN
NOLATREXED AND METHOTREXATE-RESISTANT
HUMAN LEUKAEMIA CELL LINES. Estlin, E.J., Hall, A.G., Lunec, J., Newell,

The classical antifolate methotrexate (MTX) is one ofthe mainstays of
the therapy ofchildhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. MTX acts at
multiple cytotoxic loci, including dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and
thymidylate synthase (TS). Nolatrexed dihydrochoride (AG337) is a
non-classical antifolate TS inhibitor which may circumvent resistance to
MTX due to impaired uptake, deficient polyglutamation or
overexpression ofDHFR. To investigate the influence ofTS
expression on sensitivity to antifolates, the human leukaemia cell line
clones K562:RNOL and Molt-4:RNOL were established by continuous
exposure to gradually increasing concentrations ofnolatrexed. A
MTX-resistant clone, K562:RMzx, was similarly established, but in
medium supplemented with 1 OgM inosine as a TS selection pressure.
When compared to parental lines, a 12-fold and 30-fold increase in
nolatrexed IC50, associated with a 4.6 and 12-fold increase in TS
activity, a 3.4 and 14-fold increase in TS protein, and a 3.4 and 5.5-fold
increase in TS mRNA was observed for K562:RNOL and Molt-4:RNOL
respectively. The cell lines were cross-resistant to raltitrexed (a
classical antifolate TS inhibitor), but not MTX. For K562:RMrx, which
was 16-fold resistant to MTX, and 8-fold resistant to trimetrexate (a
specific inhibitor ofDHFR), a 2-fold increase in resistance to nolatrexed
and raltitrexed was observed. This was not associated with an increase
in TS expression. For K562:RNrrx, cross resistance to specific antifolate
TS inhibition may be the result ofan increase in the intracellular
reduced folate pool.

Development of drug resistance constitutes a major obstacle in the successful
treatment of several human cancers. Breast cancer is usually initially
responsive to a wide variety of chemotherapeutic drugs, but the duration of
response is often short and many of patients will eventually relapse. More
accurate prognostic information may allow for more precise targeting of
chemotherapy for individual patients. Using immunohistochemistry we have
screened pre- and post-chemotherapy archival tissue from 21 breast cancer
patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and subsequently relapsed, for
a range of MDR related markers. The majority of these patients presented
with high grade/ histologically undifferentiated cancers. Analysis of MDR-1
Pgp expression using two MAbs directed against different epitopes of the
MDR-I Pgp revealed significant levels of MDR-1 expression in the majority
of patients at diagnosis; in general there was no significant change in Pgp
levels following chemotherapy. Preliminary results of MRP protein
expression indicate that MRP levels may be significantly increased following
chemotherapy in a number of patients. Recent work has suggested that MRP
may play a role in the prediction of response to chemotherapy in breast
cancer. Results of other MDR related markers investigated will also be
discussed.

Aims: To test the hypothesis that glutathione (GSH) is an important
determinant of treatment response for childhood acute leukaemia, blast cell
GSH levels were studied in a cohort of children with acute lymphoblastic
(ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
Background:. GSH is an intracellular thiol implicated in the development of
cytotoxic drug resistance and appears to be involved in the control of cell
proliferation and apoptosis. In both ALL and AML, the disease at relapse is
more resistant to treatment. Several indicators of poor prognosis are well
established but the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to resistant
disease are still poorly understood. GSH may play a role in mechanisms of
treatment failure.
Materials and methods: Total GSH was measured by a modified enzyme
recycling assay. Cryopreserved blasts from 62 childhood ALL and 13 AML
patients were analysed.
Results: Median GSH levels in leukaemic blasts were significantly higher in
AML (11.48 nmol/mg protein) than in ALL ( 6.54 nmol/mg protein, p= 0.014).
For ALL, there was a significant correlation between presenting white cell
count (WCC) and GSH level (r =0.45, p=O.OO). GSH was 2.2 fold higher in
T lineage ALL compared with B lineage (p < 0.0001). Patients with ALL with
a higher GSH level had a significantly worse survival (p=0.01).
Conclusions: GSH levels were higher in AML compared with ALL patients.
Patients with a higher WCC had greater GSH levels and there was an
independent correlation with T lineage immunophenotype. High GSH levels
were also associated with increased risk ofrelapse. GSH may therefore provide
a molecular mechanism by which a high WCC results in a poorer prognosis.

p7 CISPLATIN INDUCED SISTER CHROMATID
EXCHANGES IN OVARIAN CARCINOMA CELL LINES
OF DIFFERING MISMATCH REPAIR STATUS. M. Illand* and R. Brown
Dept. of Medical Oncology, CRC Beatson Laboratories, Garscube Estate,
Bearsden, Glasgow.G61 11BD.
A2780/cp70 is a cisplatin resistant derivative of the A2780 human ovarian
carcinoma cell line. A2780/cp7O has lost expression of the hMLH-1 mismatch
repair gene as characterised by Westem analysis and semi-quantitative RT-
PCR. Complermentation of mismatch repair activity by restoration of hMLH-1
expression via microcell mediated chromosome transfer of human
chromosome 3 into the A2780/ Cp7O cell line results in a partial restoration of
c~splatin sensitivity (Table 1). Thus, transfer of human chromosome 3 into
A2780/cp7O cell lines (cp7O/chr3) significantly increased the sensitivity by
approximately five fold (p < 0.05), whereas transfer of human chromosome 2
(which fails to complement mismatch repair in these lines) does not
significantly alter cisplatin sensitivity.
We propose that cells may be able to bypass lesions in DNA by recombination
events during DNA replication and that this is increased upon loss of DNA
mismatch repair activity. A prediction of this model would be that the induction
of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE's) by cisplatin would be mismatch repair
dependant. In order to address this we have examined SCE induction by
cisplatin in A2780 models of differing mismatch repair status. SCE's were
quantified by Hoechst staining, followed by Geimsa staining of BudR labelled
metaphase spreads.Thisdataissummarised inTable 1.
Cell Line I.C.so Values (pM cisplatin) Mean Increase in SCE / cell
A2780 10 5.3 (1.2)
Cp7O 65 13.5 (1.6)
Cp7O/Chr3 12 8.7 (1.4)
Cp70/Chr2 56 17.1 (1.1)
I.C.so values (jaM cisplatin) for 1h exposure to cisplatin, and the mean increase
of SCE's scored in forty metaphase spreads/cell line following a 1h exposure
to 10iAM cisplatin. Figures in parenthesis represent one standard error.
Cisplatin induced significantly more SCE's in the A2780/cp7O cell line than the
A2780 parental line (p < 0.01). Similarly, the cisplatin induced SCE level in the
A2780/cp7O/chr3 transferrants (with restored mismatch repair) was
significantly lower than the control A2780/cp7O/chr2 transferrants (p<0.01).
These observations supports the hypothesis that increased recombination
bypass during DNA replication is a mechanism of cisplatin drug resistance and
that this bypass occurs in a mismatch repair dependant manner.
P6 THE ROLE OF THE MISMATCH REPAIR PROTEIN
MLHI IN RESISTANCE TO DOXORUBICIN

Loss of expression of mismatch repair proteins is associated with resistance to
mono-functional and bifunctional alkylating agents. An association has been
shown between loss of MLHl and resistance to the clinically important
chemotherapy agent doxorubicin(Drummond et al. J Biol Chem, 1996,
271,19645-8). In order to define this association further we have examined the
effect of loss of MLH I in S. Cerevisiae and in human ovarian cell lines.
Sensitivity of wild type S. Cerevisiae to doxorubicin was compared to
an isogenic strain deleted for the scMlhl gene. Clonogenic assay demonstrated
an IC50 of SlM for the wild type strain compared with 651iM for the scMlhl
deleted strain. This represents a relative resistance of 13 fold (p<0.05).
The cell line A2780/cp7O is a cisplatin resistant derivative of A2780
known to be cross resistant to doxorubicin and to have lost expression of
hMkl]. Microcell mediated transfection of chromosome 3 into A2780/cp7O
results in restoration of MLH I expression. To assess the contribution of MLHI
to doxorubicin resistance, we compared doxorubicin sensitivity in these 2 cell
lines with parental A2780. A2780/cp7O transfected with chromosome 2 was
used as a control. Clonogenic assay demonstrated an IC50 value of 2.8nM for
A2780. The IC50 value for A2780/cp7O was 6.3nM representing a 2.3 fold
resistance compared to A2780. Introduction of chromosome 3 resulted in a
partial restoration of sensitivity to doxorubicin IC50 of 4nM (1.4 fold resistance
compared to parental A2780). The difference between all IC50 values was
significant at p<0.05. The chromosome 2 transfectant line IC50 was not
significantly different to A2780/cp7O (6.2nM). Finally, we have isolated
multiple independent doxorubicin resistant lines from both human ovarian and
breast tumour cell lines and are currently examining them for frequency of loss
of mismatch repair.
In conclusion we have demonstrated that loss of MLH1 expression,
leads to doxorubicin resistance in S. Cerevisiae. Loss of MLH I expression also
contributes to the cross resistance to doxorubicin exhibited by the cisplatin
resistant cell line A2780/cp70. These results support a role for loss of MLHI
in doxorubicin resistance.
P8 CHARACTERISATION OF MICROSATELLITE
INSTABILITY, MUTANT FREQUENCY AND
CHEMOSENSITIVITY IN TWO MURINE ADENOCARCINOMA MODELS,
MJ Thonipson, R Slack, MC Bibby & JA Double Clinical Oncology Unit,
University of Bradford, Bradford, West Yorkshire. BD7 I DP. UK
Loss of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) has been described in a number of
tumour types and leads to microsatellite instability This is observed in certain
cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma and may have clinical relevance due to
mismatch repair defects altering chemosensitivity towards certain classes of anti-
tumour agent. This study has examined microsatellite instability, mutant
frequency, and chemosensitivity of two murine adenocarcinoma tumour models,
the MAC15A and MAC13 lines
DNA was extracted from fresh and paraffin embedded normal and tumour
tissues up to twenty years old. A preliminary study of two microsatellite regions
(DI9M1T36 and D7M1T62) demonstrated that both adenocarcinoma lines exhibit
Imicrosatellite instability, with an increase in the number of microsatellite alleles
over time compared to normal tissues. The observed instability was associated with
a HPRT mutant frequency (MF) of 39 1x10-6 (±5.943 xl0-6) for the MAC15A,
which is significantly higher (p<0.005) than the <1 74 x10-6 (+0.03 x10-6) for the
MAC13 adenocarcinoma. This compared to a MF of l52x10-6 (±1.68 x10-6)
and2 22xl106 (±1 077x10-6) for the MMR deficient HCT1 16 and MMR normal
SW620 human adenocarcinoma cell lines respectively. Defects in misIltatch repair
have been found to result in a particular pattern of chemosensitivity towards agents
such as 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and cisplatin The IC50 for cisplatin was 1.003pM
(±0 857) for the MAC15A and 0.785M (+0.474) for the MACI3 For 6-TG. the
IC50 values were significantly different (p<0 005) at 0.623PM (+0.1347) and
0 0387gNM (+0 0189) for MACI5A and MAC 13 respectively.
This work therefore demonstrates two mnouse adenocarcinoma tumour
models showing evidence of microsatellite instability associated with significantly
differing mutant frequencies and chemosensitivity towards 6-TG but not cisplatin.
Further study of the MAC13 & I5A tumours, along with other MAC lines, should
provide us with a number of well charactenised in vivo models of microsatellite
instability and chemosensitivity in colonic adenocarcinomias.

Mutations of hMLHI or hMSH2 are the most common cause of loss of DNA
mismatch repair (MMR) function in colorectal cancer. Absence of DNA MMR is
observed in 90%0 of patients with Hereditarv Non-Polvsis Colorectal Cancer
(HNPCC) and 1500 of sporadic colorectal cancer cases. It has previously been
shown in *itro that loss of expression of the DNA MMR proteim. hMLH1
increases resistance to NNG. carboplatin and ctsplatin. We have investigated.
in an in vitro modeL the importance of the hMLHl protein in determining
sensitisity to chemotherapeutic drugs currently in use in the treatment of
colorectal cancer. The colon cancer cell lines used were HCT1 16. which has a
homozygous mutation of hMILHl. and tswo derivative cell lines. HCT116+3
corrected for expression of hMLHl by the addition of a normal copy of
chromosome 3) and HCTI 16+3M2 (addition of a normal copy of chromosome 3.
with subsequent loss of expression of hMLHI). Expression of hMLHl was
confirmed by western blot and a microculture tetrazohium assav used to measure
cell growth. Loss of hMLHl protein expression conferred an increase in
resistance to -Fluorouracil plus Leucovorin ( 1.8 fold). but an increase in
sensitivity to Oxaliplatin (4.3 fold). Mitomwin C (3.3 fold) and SN38. the active
metabolite of Irinotecan (2.8 fold). Therefore it was clearlv demonstrated that
hMLHl does have a function in predicting response to these chemotherapeutic
agents in an in vitro setting As loss ofhMLHl expression was observed to confer
altered sensitivity to agents which induce a range of insults to DNA a wide role
for this protein in the recognition and signahng of cell damage uas suested.
Further investigation of the role hMLHl and of the other DNA MMR proteins
may be important in aiding the targeting of chemotherapeutic agents for patients
w-ith abnormalities in this group of genes.

Recent evidence strongly supports a direct role for DNA mismatch repair in the
sensitivity of mammalan cells to a wide range of DNA damaging agents Amongst
this data, it has been shown that hMSH2. the human homologue of the bacterial MutS
mismatch repair protein. binds to the cisplatin 1.2-intrastrand crosslink in vitro.
(Duckett et al, 1996. PNAS 93. 6443). Furthermore. cell lines deficient in hMSH2
gain increased sensithitv to cisplatin following reintroduction of the gene by
chromosome transfer (Aebi et al- 1997. Chin Cancer Res 3.1763) To understand the
mechanisms underlying mismatch repair involvement we examined the clonogenic
sensitivities to cisplatin and UV radiation in isogemuc strains of the yeast
Saccharomrvces cerevisiae disrupted for one of three MutS homologues. MSH2.
MSH3 or MSH6 2x10 cells were treated with 0-3mM cisplatin for 24hours in liquid
culture. 400 cells were subsequenth plated on YPD culture plates. and colonies
counted 3 days later. For UV treatment cells were plated. irradiated with 0-250 J/mn
UVC irradiation at 254nM. and colonies counted three days later. The three single
mutants were significantly 1.6 fold (MSH6). 1.7-fold (MSH3) and 2.3 fold (MSH2)
more resistant to cisplatin treatment than the isogenic wild type strain. 1D90=1. 3mM
(p<0.005). However. the sensitivity of these single mutants to UV treatment was not
significantly changed from wild type (1190 =170 J/m:). Reintroduction of MSH2 back
into the MSH2-disrupted mutant increased the sensitivitV of this strain approxiimatel-
1.4 fold to cisplatin. (11)90=2.0mM) as compared to the mutant strain (1D90=3mAL
p<0.05). implicating a direct im-olvement of MSH2 in cisplatin sensitivity. The
clonogenic sensitivit to these agents was also examined in *east disrupted for the
recombinational repair gene. RAD52. which are hypersensitive to both cisplatin
(11)90=0.73mM) and UV treatment (ID90=70 J/m:) as compared to wild type. Results
showed that a disruption of the MSH2 gene in this background did not significantly
alter the hvpersensitivit to cisplatin or LWV. These findings provide direct evidence
that members of the mismatch repair famih are imnolved in the cytotoxuicitv to
cisplatin and show that MSH2 may modulate cytotoxicity in a RAD52 dependent
pathway. One possibility is that mismatch repair may influence a recombinational
adduct bypass mechanism dependent on RAD52. When mismatch repair is disrupted
loss ofcontrol of this bypass mechanism may lead to resistance

Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumrour caused by the recessive inactivation ofthe
RB tumnour supressor gen. The RBI product, pRb, acts to regulate the
balance between cell cycle progression, differentiation and apoptosis and
consequently loss of this protein results in the disruption of the differentiation
programme and unlimited cell proliferation which is accompanied by extensive
apoptosis.
We have quantified the distribution of p53, its downstream effector p21 (WAF-
1) and apoptotic cells by immunohistochenistry in rtinoblastomnas within the
proximal. rmiddle and distal zones of turour sleeves composed of viable tissue
surrounding a central blood vessel with outer regions of confluent apoptosis. in
tumour tissue of varying extents of differentiation.
By Kruskal-Wallis analysis, we have demonstrated in poorly differentiated
areas of the tunour, p53 expression increases from the proximal to the distal
regions of the tunour as does the proportion of apoptotic cells while p21
expression is restricted primarily to the proximal regions of the tumour adjacent
to the blood vessel. By contrast in well differentiated areas of the tunour, this
pattern of p53 expression is reversed However, dte distribution of p21 and the
proportion of apoptotic cells remain independent of the differentiation state By
Spearman rank test, p53 expression correlates positively with apoptosis but
negatively with p2 1. Sequencing of exons 5-8 of reinoblastoma cell lines Y79
WERI-Rbl and archival material indicates that the expressed p53 is wild type
Our in vitro study using the Y79 cell line indicates that the balance of cell
proliferation and cell death is influenced markedly by FCS concentration and to
a lesser extent oxygen availability and that optimum p53 induction is observed
under growth factor and oxygen limiting conditions
We conclude that rennoblastoma cells are protected from p53 mediated
programmed cell death by the production of survival factors which are
stimulated by the diffusion of oxygen and growth factors delivered to the tumour
bv the blood vessel and that p21 is involved not in cell death but in cell survival.
Recent studies also indicate that the survival proto-oncogene Bcl-2 is not
involved in the cell survival mechanism.

Mutation of the tumour suppressor protein p53 has been implicated in resistance of
ovarian cancer to cisplatn We have determined the p53 and bcl-2 status of a pair
of human ovarian tumour xenografts (PXN65 and PXN100) curable with cisplatin.
and investigated the effects of a single dose of cisplatin on induction of genes
downstream to p53 and on DNA repair. Both of these tumours fail to grow in
vitro. Functional p53 status was determined by measuring MDM-2 and p21 'PI'
mRNA induction 4 hours following 5 Gy by northern blotting. Single-strand
conformational polymorphism and sequencing of exons 5. 6. 7 and 8 of P53 were
carried out using standard techniques. Bcl-2 protein levels were determined by
immunoblotting. Following a single dose of 6mg kg-' cisplatin i.p. induction of
p21%'-Fc. MDM-2 and BAX mRNA was determined by northern blotting and
gene-specific repair was determined by quantitative PCR of a 1.9Kb fiagment of
H-RAS. The PXN65 tumour showed no re-growth after 350 days following 3 X
6mg kg-' i.p. cisplatin The PXN100 tumour showed no re-growth after 300 days
following 4 X 8mg kg-' i.p. cisplatin- Following a single dose of 6mg kg-' cisplatin
the growth delay was 76.1 and 24.9 days for PXN65 and PXN100. respectively.
p21Fl l and MDM-2 mRNA levels were elevated 4 and 2.5 fold respectivelx

suggesting no wild type p53 function. No mutations were found in PXN100. but a
deletion of bp 868 at codon 290 and a insertion of GTGGTGAG was seen in
PXN65 causing a frame shift and premature stop at codon 306. High levels ofbcl-
2 protein were present in both xenografts and levels were elevated following
irradiation. p21wF~cP'. MDM-2 and BAX mRNA levels were induced 3-fold at
24 hours following a single dose of 6mg kg-' cisplatin in PXN100. but were
undetectable in PXN65. There was measurable damage to the H-RAS gene
following a single dose of 6mg kg- cisplatin that was repaired by 24 hours post
treatment in both tumours. This work suggests that p53 may not be the primary
determinant of response to cisplatin in these human ovarian cancer tumour
xenografts.
P16 DOES TP53 FUNCTION IN NEUROBLASTOMA ?

Aims To test the functional integrity of the TP53 pathway in neuroblastoma cell
lines by induction of TP53 in response to DNA damage and measuring the
effect on 3 TP53 upregulated genes: WAF1, BAX and MDM2, together with
one which it may downregulate: BCL2.
Background Wild-type TP53 has been reported to be overexpressed and
abnormally located in the cytoplasm of neuroblastoma tissue and cell lines
where it may be unable to function normally' 2
Methods 4 neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type TP53, the neuroepithelioma
cell line NB100, (which has a TP53 mutation producing a non-functonal
truncated protein3) (-ve control) and the breast cancer MCF-7 cell line (+ve
control'), were treated with 4Gy of ionising radiation (IR). Cells were harvested
at different times and TP53, WAF1, MDM2, BCL2 and BAX expression
detected by immunocytochemistry and Westem Blotting using enhanced
chemiluminescence. In addition, apoptosis was scored by Hoechst nuclear
staining.
Results The peak values and times (hours) for the various proteins relative to
untreated controls, and % apoptosis are shown below. In all neuroblastorna cell
lines studied TP53 was predominantly nuclear pre and post IR.(-+ =no change)

Conclusions Nuclear TP53 is inducible by IR in all the neuroblastoma cell lines
studied with wild-type TP53. WAF1 induction correlates with TP53 induction
but induction of other TP53 response genes is variable, suggesting that the
TP53 pathway may be intact in some cell lines (IMR-32, SHEP, SHSY5Y) but
not others (SKNSH) Further studies are in progress to confirm and extend
these findings.

P17 EXPRESSION OF P53, WAF1, MDM2 AND BCL-2
PROTEINS IN HUMAN GERM CELL TESTICULAR TUMOURS.
E Institoris*, H.Eid, I.Bodrogi, L.Geczi and M.Bak, National Institute of
Oncology, 1122. Budapest, Rath Gyorgy str. 7-9. Hungary
We investigated the expression of p53 tumour suppressor gene protein and
its related products mdm2, wafl and bcl-2 proteins in human germ cell
testicular tumours (GCTTs) using Western blot or/and
immunohistochemical analyses. Except differentiated teratoma, all GCT
tumours ofuntreated patients (77) were immunoreactive for p53 to various
extent. Seminomas and embryonal carcinoma components had the most
positive immunostaining. P53 showed a significant inverse correlation with
stage of disease (P< 0.003). Numerous recent studies strongly suggest that
the p53 in GCT cancer has wild-type character. In contrast with mutant p53
the wild-type p53 is able to induce cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor i.e.
wafl protein (El Deiry et al., Cell 75:817, 1993), which is a crucial protein
in cell-cycle control. Therefore, we analysed GCTT samples (36) for wafl
using Western blot technique. There was no sign of wafl expression in any
tumours investigated. The same cohort studied for wafl was analysed for
mdm2 by Western blot and immunohistochemistry as well. 30% of GCT
tumours displayed mdm2 expression. The failure of wafl expression in
GCTTs can not be explained by p53 inactivation caused by mdm2, since
70% of tumour samples did not express mdm2 protein at all. We also
screened bcl-2 expression in patients with GCTTs using
immunohistochemistry. 58% of tumours stained with anti-bcl-2. The bcl-2
expression was clearly dominant in tumours of advanced stages and the
incidence of bcl-2 exprression was higher in tumours from metastatic
patients than in tumours from metastatic-free patients (P < 0.000). Our
findings suggest that bcl-2, during suppression of wafl may interfere with
the functional properties of p53 protein and this interaction may be a
mechanism by which bcl-2 exercises its oncogenic potential.

It is well documented that a large proportion of low grade follicular
lymphomas transform to a more aggressive high grade disease. Once
this transformation has taken place the patients clinical outcome is
particularly poor (1). A number of chromosomal and genetic changes
have been described in low grade follicular lymphomas that have
shown evolution to the high grade centroblastic lymphomas. Genetic
analysis of this transformation has centred around the bcl-2. p53 and
myc genes.
We have used the RT-PCR technique of differential display (2) to
analyse the differential gene expression pattern between the low grade
follicular and high grade centroblastic lymphomas. Using this
technique we have identified a cDNA that shows overexpression in low
grade follicular lymphoma samples. Following cloning and
sequencing, this cDNA was shown to have 100%/6 homology with the 3'
untranslated region of a recently identified pro-apoptopic gene. DP5
(3). This gene also shows some homology to the pro-apoptopic gene
hrk (4), which interacts with Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and may represent a
family of genes involved in apoptosis regulation. Differential
expression was confirmed using competitive RT-PCR and indicated
that this gene showed an up-regulation of 100 fold in the low grade
follicular lymphoma compared with the high grade centroblastic
lymphoma samples. In situ hybridisation was also performed to
identify the localisation of expression.

Neuroblastoma is a chemosensitive tumour and combined chemotherapy is
considered an important treatment modality. Like many early onset tumours.
neuroblastomas do not have p53 mutations; this play a role in drug sensitivity. However, it
has been suggested that p53 may be inactivated in neuroblastomas because of cytoplasmic
sequestration. We have investigated if the p53 response pathway differs between drug
sensitive and resistant neuroblastoma cell lines. The cell line model systems used were: SH-
SY5Y, a neuroblastic clone (N-type), and SH-EPl, a substrate adherent clone (S-type). Both
are subclones of SK-N-SH which has wtp53. Etoposide produces equal levels of DNA
damage in both cell types but clonogenic assays demonstrate that SH-SYSY are >3 fold
more sensitive than SH-EPl. Before etoposide treatment p53 is located in the cytoplasm of
both cell types, although at significantly higher levels in SH-EP1. Four hours after drug
treatment the majority of p53 translocates to the nucleus in SH-SYSY and cells undergo
apoptosis whilst in SH-EPI the majority of p53 remains in the cytoplasm However, in SH-
EPI etoposide results in a 12.9-fold increase in p21"'"' RNAand protein and cells arrest
in G1-phase of the cell cycle whereas in SH-SYSYp21 increases by only 3.4-fold and cells
undergo apoptosis in less than four hours. In SH-EPl cells 7 days after etoposide treatment
(1 h) the cells have a morphologically distinct neuronal phenotype. These daiasuggest that
neuroblastoma types that retain the p21 upregulation pathway may be relatively resistant
to drug induced apoptosis and differentiate rather than die in response to etoposide. p21 has
previously been demonstrated to be essential for survival of differentiating neuroblastoma
cells in response to retinoic acid. Analysis of the expression of the Bcl-2 family members
can not explain the differential sensitivity. Levels of expression of Bax, Bak and Bcl-XL
are similar in the SH-EPI and SH-SY5Y cells, whilst paradoxically Bc1-2 is overexpressed
in SH-SY5Y, the apoptosis sensitive cell type. In conclusion, firstly we find that in
neuroblastomas where the majority of wtp53 translocates to the nucleus cells rapidly
undergo apoptosis. Secondly in cells which induce high levels of p21 cell cycle
checkpoints are activated and cells undergo further differentiation and survival.

We have examined the expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 family protein,
bcl-w, in more than 50 colorectal adenocarcinomas, using
immunohistochemical techniques. We have found that >90% of tumours
show expression of the protein, which was cytoplasmic in location. No
expression of bcl-w was observed in adjacent normal epithelium taken from
the same patients. No correlation was found between expression of bcl-w
and bcl-2 and p53 expression and Duke's stage. In only 2 out of 9
adenocarcinomas of the stomach was sporadic bcl-w immunoreactivity
observed. Adenocarcinomas from other epithelial tissues (breast, cervix)
failed to demonstrate any expression of bcl-w. We are currently
investigating the expression of bcl-w in adenomatous polyps. In the
adenomas that have been examined so far, only 1/9 showed bcl-w
expression although 6/9 demonstrated various levels of bcl-2 expression.
We are currently seeking to expand this study to assess the importance of
bcl-w in colorectal cancer.

P21 INVOLVEMENT OF Bcl-2 FAMILY MEMBERS
IN DRUG RESISTANCE TO TOPOISOMERASE I (TOPO I)
INHIBITORS, J.S. Macpherson*, J. Cummings, J.F. Smyth and D.
I. Jodrell, ICRF Medical Oncology Unit, Western General Hospital,
Edinburgh, EH4 2XU.
Cellular responses to novel (NU/ICRF 505) and established
(camptothecin, CPT) topo I inhibitors have been investigated in a
panel of human cell lines and drug sensitivity was associated with the
presence of functional p53 protein (with or without p21WAFl/CIPl
induction and Gi/S block). In order to gain insights into less sensitive
p53-independent processes, basal expression and temporal induction
of 4 key members of the Bcl-2 family were determined in wild type
p53 chemosensitive A2780 ovarian cancer cells and mutant p53
chemoresistant HT29 colon cancer cells. Cells were exposed to drugs
at their IC5o concentrations and proteins measured by Western blot
analysis for up to 72 hr. Bcl-2 was not detectable in both cell lines nor
was it induced after drug exposure. Likewise Bcl-xs was not
detectable prior to drug treatment nor stimulated post drug treatment.
High basal levels of the apoptosis inhibitor protein BCI-XL were
measured in HT29 compared to A2780 whereas the reverse situation
was recorded with the death inducing protein Bax. There was no
evidence of Bcl-XL induction in both cell lines. CPT produced a 4-fold
maximal increase in HT29 cells and 2-fold maximal increase in A2780
cells in Bax protein at 36 hr post-treatment. However, NU/ICRF 505
had no significant effect on Bax protein levels. Thus, in vitro drug
resistance to topo I inhibitors is also associated with a high Bcl-xl/Bax
ratio as well as the presence of mutant p53. In addition, these data
provide evidence that cells can respond to the DNA damage induced
by different topo I inhibitors through the selective induction of
apoptosis modulating proteins.
P23 Transfection of bax into resistant human ovarian
carcinoma cell lines confers no sensitisation to
chemotherapeutic agents.

The BCL-2 family ofproteins are known to be important in the process of apoptosis.
The mechanism of action of BCL-2, an anti-apoptotic protein is unknown but it may
act via ion channel pumps in the mitochondria. BAX can form heterodimers with
BCL-2 and antagonise this function leading to a pro-apoptotic effect. Some studies
have shown that overexpression of BAX can lead to sensitivity to some
chemotherapeutic agents but not to others. We investigated two human ovarian
carcinoma cell lines which are resistant to cisplatin (SKOV3, with intrinsic resistance
and A2780cisR, with acquired resistance). Cell lines were transfected with bax
coupled to an HA tag cloned into the bicistronic plasmid vector pIRES-P
(EMBL:Z75185) or with an empty vector. Clones were selected using puromycin.
BAX overexpression was confirmed by western blotting (1.4 fold increase for
A2780cisR and 5.8 fold for SKOV3). Cell sensitivity to 8 drugs was assessed by 96
hour sulforhodamine B cytotoxicity assay (tables 1, 2). There was marginal
sensitisation to cisplatin in the A2780cisR compared with the puromycin control (RF
1.3). For all other drugs tested there was no significant sensitisation.

Previously, we have demonstrated that transfection of bcl-2 into the A2780 cell line
does not confer resistance to the same chemotherapeutic drugs and preliminary
results have shown that transfection of CHI, a sensitive human ovarian carcinoma
cell line with bclxl does not confer resistance to cisplatin.
Overall, these results suggest that altering the level of one of the Bcl-2 family
members by transfection in these human ovarian carcinoma cell lines does not alter
the chemosensitivity.
P22 APOPTOSIS REGULATOR BCL-2: A PREDICTIVE

The bcl-2 gene encodes a protein that blocks apoptosis and
may be associated with neoplastic progression by overriding
programmed cell death. The bcl-2 gene was originally identified
as being overexpressed in follicular lymphomas due to the
t(14;18) chromosomal translocation. We investigated bcl-2
protein expression in 102 colorectal carcinomas with ten year
follow-up. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumour tissue
sections were examined by immunohistochemistry using a
monoclonal bcl-2 antibody (Dako) with microwave antigen
retrieval. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tumour tissue of
the cases immunohistochemically positive for bcl-2.
Cytoplasmic staining of the bcl-2 gene product was seen in
the tumour cells of 22 cases (22%). Using a PCR technique we
examined the possibility that the t(14;18) translocation contributes
to bcl-2 overexpression in colorectal cancer but found no
evidence of this. Expression of bcl-2 protein was related to
tumour grade (p=0.009) but was unrelated to patient age, sex,
tumour site, tumour size or Dukes' stage. In a sub-group of 66
cases, bcl-2 expression was unrelated to p53 status as assessed
by immunohistochemistry and single-strand conformation
polymorphism analysis.
There was a trend towards increased survival in those whose
tumours expressed bcl-2 protein (p=0.055). When entered into a
multivariate analysis, this survival difference was independent of
tumour stage (p=0.05). These results suggest that bcl-2
expression in colorectal cancer is associated with a better long-
term prognosis.
P24 BCL2 FAMILY PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN CHILDHOOD
ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKAEMIA. Hogarth L.,
Pearson A.D.J., and Hall, A. Paediatric Oncology, CRU, Medical School, Newcastle,
NE2 4HH, UK.
In vitro studies have shown that expression of the bcl-2 family of
proteins can determine the susceptibility ofcells to undergo apoptosis
in response to various chemotherapeutic agents but correlations with
clinical response have been less extensively reported. We have studied
protein expression of bcl-2, bax, bcl-xl, bcl-xs and mcl-l in
lymphoblasts from children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)
using Western blottingwith enhanced chemiluminescence detection and
densitometry. Results were expressed as a ratio to actin as an internal
control.
Samples from 46 cases at presentation and 16 on relapse showed no
significant difference in protein expression (bcl-2; 3.4 vs 2.6, bax;1.35
vs 1.3, bcl-2/bax ratio; 2.3 vs 2.35, mcl-1/bax ratio; 1.1 vs 1.15 and
mcl-1; 1.6 vs 1.5). Bcl-xl was only detected in 2 presentation cases.
Bcl-xs was not detected in any of the samples tested. There was no
correlation between levels of expression and event-free survival.
Whereas in vitro sensitivity to prednisolone, determined in 30 patients
using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl] tetrazolium (MTT)
assay, correlated with event-free survival there was no relationship
between prednisolone or daunorubicin sensitivity and expression ofbax,
bcl-2/bax or mcl-1.This study suggests the measurement ofexpression
ofbcl-2, bax, bcl-xl, bcl-xs and mcl-l is of limited prognostic value in
childhood ALL.

including SR43 17. It is proposed that these pro-drugs can be combined
with radiotherapy or other forms of chemotherapy to target the hypoxic
regions in tumours, whilst the consentional modality reduces the aerobic
component. To gain a better understanding of the mechanism of
activation and toxicity of TPZ, A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells
wsere exposed to escalating doses of TPZ over a six month period and
clones were selected that were resistant to TPZ in air (Elwell JH et at,
Biochem Pharmacol. 54.2.p249-257, 1997). Biochemical changes that
may have accounted for the increased drug resistance included elesated
levels of antioxidant enzymres and greatly diminished activity of P450R.
We report here that one of the A549 clones that showed about a 40 fold
reduction in P450R actisity was also resistant to TPZ under hypoxic
conditions. In order to determine whether this relationship was causal we
transfected this clone with a vector containing P450R under the control
of the moloney leukaemia virus LTR. A series of stable clones, with up
to 200 times greater P450R activity than the parental clonal cell line,
were generated. Using HPLC we have shown a significant relationship
between P450R activity and SR4317 formation velocity in the
transfected clones. Further. we have also shown that by artificially
elevating the P450R actisityv the hypoxic sensitisity to TPZ was
restored. This provides further evidence that P450R is important in the
hNpoxic actisation of this lead bioreductise drug, that is presently being
evaluated in clinical trials. (NIPS is a MRC Clinical training fellow).

This study is an integrated appach to the development of new treatment
strategies directed at specific genes involved in the pathogenesis of human
breast cancer. Genetic abnormnalte play a key role i the pathogenesis of
breast cancer. I we could target these abnormnaltes and deregulate their
expression, then we couAd have a powerful new therapeutic strategy against
breast cancer. One gene that is aberrantly expressed in breast tumour tissue is
the c-erbB2 oncogene. Breast cancer is the most common cancer found in
European women (180,000 cases per year). k has been shown that patients
who overexpress the c-erbB-2 proto-oncogene have aggressive tumours
refractory to conventional therapies. Therefore, new therapeubc strategies are
required for management of these high nsk groups. We affn to downregulate
expression of the erb-B2 gene by interfering with the transcrtional machinery
of the c-erb-B2 promoter. We are evaluating a triplex strategy based on the
abity to design molecules that bind to sequence-selected sites on DNA
These Triple helix-forming ODNs (TFOs) are snml molecules designed to bind
to the double helx of DNA in a specific manner and disrutt binding of proteins
(transcripion factors) which promote gene expression. We have identified a 28
base pair punne-nch region near the TATA box in the erb-B2 promoter which is
a putative target for this triple helix approach Specifically we have synthesised
and tested a novel antigene oigodeoxynucleotides(ODNs) directed against
this region within the erb-B2 promoter. Specific binding of the antisense TFO
(when cormpared to nornsense or scramrbled sequence TFOs) to the target
promoter region has been achieved at physiological pH. Dissociation constants
(kd) for the selected TFOs has been deterrrnned using a concentration range of
10-11 to 10-7 M in Electromobility shift analysis (EMSAs) to permit selection of
optimally binding TFOs and to define appropnate TFO concentrations to be
used in sibsequent DNA-binding protein/TFO cormpetition expenments
EMSAs have indicated thatth he binding is strong and not easily reversible while
DNase Footprinting analysis has confimed the exquisite specificity of binding
to the erbB-2 promoter. Therefore, the use of antigene TFOs represents a
highly specific method to target genes that play a role in the pathogenesis of
breast cancer.

Antisense Oligodeoxynucleotdes(ODNs) have great potential for specific

wav in which antisense ODNs achieve their effect is through actisation of

variable abilities to promote RNAse H cleavage and an attractive option in
antisense thexapy would be to provide the aniisense molecule itself with
RNA or DNA cleaving activity We have investigaied the use of ruthenium
photosensitisers as potential cleaving agents Ruthenium molecules(Ru)
are photo-activatable moieties which bind with a high dissociation constant
to nucleic acids and when activated lead to srnd cleavage. Initial
experiments focussed on the use of free ruthenium(Ru-free) directed against

polyacrylamide gel electropboresis(PAGE) Incubations were performed in
different buffers(containing different ions) and at differing salt conditions

specificity of this Ru-ODN approach was confirmed by the obser'ation of a

studies are focussing on the ability of these agents to direct cleavage of RNA

Oxidation products (currently being characterised) from sensitive cel lines have been
detected. However, in vivo pharnacokinetic studies in rats (dosed orally and
intravenously) showed rapid conversion of DF 203 into a single N-acetytated metabolite
(KF 498). No metabolites were detected in mice.
Ring hydroxytated and N-acetyhted denvatives of DF 203 have becn synthesised
and their in Vitro cytotoxicsics evaluated in a panel of human tumour cell nes. These
derivatives are largely inactive, with pM ICso values compared to the nM IC50 values of
DF 203 (Shi et al, 1996, J. Med- Chem., 39, 3375), suggesting these steps to be
detoxifying
The relative compositions of activating and detoxifying enzyrres dictates the
disposition and activity of many drugs and xenobiotics. In attempting to decipher the
bioactivation pathway of DF 203, the compositions of common xenobiotic metabolising
enzymes in sensitive, insensitive and resistant cells were examined by immunoblotting with
specific antibodies. Cytochrome P450 (CYP)IA1 and CYPIBI, implicated in the critical
N-oxidation of aromatic ariens, were induced in MCF-7 cells and its acquired resistant
variant MCF-7/LT 10pM, as well as MDA 468 cells In contrast, glutatbione S-

We are developing inhibitors of the key enzyme in the androgenic biosynthetic
pathway, cytochrome P45017,, (17a-hydroxylase/C1720 lyase) as potential drugs
for the treatment of hormone dependent prostate cancer. Our lead compound,
abiraterone (17-(3-pyridyl) androsta-5,16-dien-30-ol), when tested as its 0-
acetate prodrug in vivo in mice, reduced circulating androgens and caused
regression of androgen dependent organs. Studies with the enzyme from
murine and human testes showed that abiraterone is a slow binding
"irreversible" inhibitor. The extent of inhibition increased with time and
appeared enhanced by preincubation with the enzyme. The apparent first order
rate constant for the inhibition of the human enzyme was dependent on the
concentration of abiraterone, being 0.14 ± 0.03 min-' with 5nM and 1.2 ± 0.3
min' with 20nM abiraterone (in the presence of 1pM pregnenolone), and was
inversely dependent on the pregnenolone concentration in the assay, being 1.2
± 0.3 min-' at 1 M and 0.40 ± 0.03 min-' at 3gM pregnenolone (in the presence
of 20nM abiraterone). This is as expected if the inhibitor competes with the
substrate for binding at the active site. However, the rate constant was
unaffected by the concentration of the cofactor NADPH. Once inhibited by
abiraterone, the extent of inhibition was unaffected by the concentration of
substrate in the assay and the measured IC50 was 1.2nM. Furthermore the
inhibition was subsequently unaffected by 24hr dialysis. The exact mechanism
of the enzyme-abiraterone interaction is unknown. However, knowledge of the
irreversible inhibitory behaviour of abiraterone is important for its clinical
scheduling.

Inhibition of the high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
(EGFr TK) activity frequently observed in a variety of human tumors may have a
potential therapeutic benefit. To date a number of potent, reversible ATP competitive
inhibitors of EGFr have been reported. High levels of intracellular ATP and a high
rate of new receptor synthesis in some cell lines suggest that irreversible inhibition of
EGFr autophosphorylation may be advantageous for good anti-tumor activity. This
rationale has led to the design and synthesis of the 7-acrylamido-4-
anilinoquinazoline, PD 160678, which is a sub-nanomolar, selective, irreversible
inhibitor of the EGFr TK. Subsequent structure activity studies have established that
introduction of the acrylamide functionality at the 6-position, as in PD 168393, is
optimal for irreversible inhibition. Analogues possessing soluble cationic side-chains
at the 7-position, such as the morpholinopropyloxy derivative PD 169540, are also
potent, irreversible EGFr inhibitors showing significant anti-tumor activity in vivo
using both IP and PO dosing protocols.

The monoterpene, limonene, is found as its R-enantiomer in orange peel and
other plant oils. R-Limonene causes regression of both spontaneous and chemically
induced tumours in rats and is in clinical trials in advanced cancer patients. R-
Limonene undergoes extensive metabolism in vivo and in human plasma, R-perillic
acid and its non-chiral reduction product, dihydroperillic acid are among the most
abundant metabolites, whilst the glucuronide conjugates of R-perillic acid and R-
perillyl alcohol are found in urine. Quantification and characterisation of the
metabolites of limonene is important, because the known Phase metabolites are
more potent inhibitors of small G protein isoprenylation than limonene. Using HPLC-
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (LC/APCI/MS), a novel
metabolite has been detected in both human plasma and urine, which appeared to be
an isomer of perillic acid (Poon et al., 1996 Drug Metabolism and Disposition 24: 565).
The structure has now been confirmed by chemical synthesis. 4-Acetyl-1-
methylcyclohexene was converted into its triflate by base catalysed reaction with triflic
anhydride in the presence of the hindered base, 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methyl pyridine.
The triflate was methoxycarbonylated to give p-menth-1,8-dien-10-oic acid, which by
LC/APCI/MS, was identical with the novel metabolite detected in human plasma.
Previous reports on the activity of perillic acid against isoprenylation enzymes refer to
the S-enantiomer, although it is the R form which is produced from R-limonene. In
this study, we also describe the synthesis of R-perillic acid via a two-step oxidation
from the corresponding R-perillyl alcohol. The above monoterpenes were tested for
inhibitory activity towards famesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyltransferase
(GGTase I) using published procedures. Rat brain cytosol provided a source of the
enzymes, with H-Ras (WT) as protein acceptor for FTase and H-Ras (CVLL) for
GGTase I. The results as IC5o values in mM are shown below.

known metabolites, R-perillic acid and R-periilyl alcohol.
P36 ANALYSIS OF CELL CYCLE EFFECTS AND SUBSEQUENT
DEATH OF NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINES
AFTER SHORT-TERM MITOMYCIN C EXPOSURE, N.Robertsoji and l..J,Stratford.
Experimental Oncology Group, School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University
ofManchester, Manchester M13 9PL.
Mitomycin C (MMC) is used clinically to treat a wide variety of solid tusnours, and is the
single most active agent for the treatment ofnon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
For this study, 3 NSCLC cell lines have been chosen, H460, A549 and H647, which
show a 73-fold range in their response to MMC as measured by the MIT assay after 3 hr
drug exposure ( mean IC50 values of0.18 pM, 3.55 pM and 13.1 piM respectively), but show
little difference when assessed by colony-forming assay ( mean IC90 values of 0.11 M, 0.19
pM and 0.17 pM respectively). These cell lines show similar levels of enzymes previously
implicated in the metabolism, or detoxification, of MMC, aid we have shown that the DNA
damage formed after MMC exposure is equivalent (Robertson & Stratford, Br.J.Cancer, 75,
Suppl.I (27),1997), therefore further investigation was deemed appropriate.
Cell cycle effects after 3 hrs MMC exposure (1.5 pM) have been assessed using FACS
analysis of fixed propidium iodide-stained cells.All three cell lines exhibit G2 block 24 hrs
post MMC exposure but vary in their subsequent response. H647 cells are attempting to
divide by Day 3 , and then rapidly die. Some H460 cells persist in G2 block for at least 7 days
before dying, but a considerable number of A549 cells remain in apparently irreversible G2
block, or as large cells, for at least 21 days after drug exposure (NB. Control cells maintained
for this period were seen to be cycling normally).
In an attempt to gain further information with regards to the death of these cells after
exposure to MMC a number of methods were employed. Estimation of total cell number over
21 days shows H647 and H460 cell numbers to fall far more rapidly than A549 cells as would
be expected. Exclusion of propidium iodide combined with Rhodamine 123 uptake by the
cells (analysed by FACS) allows a simultaneous measure ofcell viability and ofmitochondrial
membrane potential (alterations associated with onset of apoptosis). Marked differences were
apparent between the 3 ceil lines with respect to changes in mitochodrial function, and the
percentage of necrotic cells present at each timepoint, but there was no evidence of apoptosis
using this technique (We are currently attempting to confirm these results using an assay of
Annexin V-binding. Results will be presented).
In conclusion, the 3 NSCLC cell lines react very differently to short term MMC
exposure but it would appear that their overall long term survival is the same at this drug
concentration, and that the colony forming assay reflects this more accurately than the MTT
assay. These results suggest that the MUT assay is not a suitable measure of cellular
sensitivity for drugs, such as MMC, which cause cell cycle arrest over prolonged periods

P39 THE EFFECT OF APHIDICOLIN, AN INHIBITOR OF
POLYMERASES, IN HUMAN OVARIAN CARCINOMA
CELLS WITH DIFFERING MISMATCH REPAIR STATUS AND CISPLATIN
SENSITIVITY. N. Moreland and R. Brown, CRC Department of Medical
Oncology, CRC Beatson Laboratories, Switchback Road, Glasgow, G61 1BD.
Recent observations suggest mismatch repair (MMR) proteins provide
a link between cisplatin induced DNA damage and apoptotic responses in a
variety of carcinoma cells. It has been proposed that in the absence of MMR
intrastrand crosslinks are bypassed during replication, giving a cisplatin
resistant phenotype.
We have used aphidicolin (Ap), an inhibitor of polymerases c., 6 and i:,
as a tool to study the role of polymerases in cisplatin resistance. The cell lines
used were A2780, a MMR proficient, cisplatin sensitive ovarian line,
A2780/cp7O, a cisplatin resistant derivative of the A2780 line defective for
MMR, and the chromosome transfer lines, cp7O-ch3 and cp7O-ch2. Cp7O-ch3
are stable chromosome 3 transfers which exhibit restored MMR and cisplatin
sensitivity, while cp7O-ch2 are stable chromosome 2 transfers which remain
defective for MMR and cisplatin resistant. The IC50 values for 24h exposures to
Ap were 1.9, 2.4, 3.1 and 2.1 AlM for the A2780, A2780/cp70, cp7O-ch3 and
cp7O-ch2 lines, respectively, as measured by clonogenic assay. These lC5c
values did not correlate with MMR status or cisplatin sensitivity but rather to
the proportion of S-phase cells present at the time Ap exposure was begun (I
= 0.79). This suggested a line with a higher basal level of S-phase cells has
increased polymerase activity and requires higher concentrations of Ap to
inhibit this activity.
To examine the effect of polymerase inhibition after cisplatin treatment
in MMR proficient and deficient cells, clonogenic assays employing a
combination of cisplatin and Ap have been performed in the cp7O-ch3 and
cp70-ch2 lines. A 1 hr exposure to cisplatin (20 plM) resulted in decreases in
surviving fractions of 0.40 + 0.05 and 0.70 ± 0.04 in cp7O-ch3 and cp7O-ch2
cells, respectively. The addition of an IC50 concentration of Ap after cisplatin
treatment decreased the surviving fractions further to 0.13 + 0.01 and 0 22
0.09, respectively. This data suggested a more pronounced effect of Ap in
sensitising MMR deficient cells to cisplatin. Analysis of drug resistance in
cp7O-ch2 compared to cp7O-ch3 after treatment with cisplatin alone or cisplatin
in combination with Ap revealed the addition of Ap caused a significant
decrease in the fold-resistance values (p = 0.003). This indicated that inhibition
of polymerases after cisplatin lesions are produced reduces resistance in MMR
deficient cells and supports the hypothesis that increased replicative bypass is
involved in cisplatin resistance.
COMPARATIVE EFFECTS OF CISPLATIN AND
P38
MELPHALAN ON TELOMERASE ACTIVITY IN A
TESTICULAR CELL LINE. T.R.Cressey, M.J.Tilby*, D.R.Newell, Cancer Research
Unit, University ofNewcastle., Newcastle Upon Tyne, NE2 4HH
Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase which adds telomeric
repeat units of 5-(TTTAGGG)-3' onto the ends of human chromosomes. In
non-transformed cells, telomeres, the specialised region at the end of the
chromosome, shorten after successive replications. Extreme attrition of the
telomeric region appears to cause initiation of cellular senescence. Activation of
telomerase is thought to be one of the precursors for the immortalisation of
cells.
It was previously reported that cisplatin inhibits telomerase while other DNA
damaging agents, such as melphalan and transplatin, had no effect ( Burger et
al, Eur. J. Cancer, 26, p638, 1997 ). However, in another report, decreased
telomerase activity was associated with non-specific tumour cell killing 'in
vitro' ( Faranoi et al, Clin. Cancer Res, 3, p579, 1997 ). The objectives of the
present study were to confirm the specific inhibition of telomerase by cisplatin
and investigate the underlying mechanism.
Using the testicular cell line Susa CP, telomerase activity was measured using
the Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP assay).
Following a 4 hour exposure of Susa CP cells to 100pM cisplatin or melphalan
and growth in drug free medium for a further 20 or 44 hours, telomerase
activity was measured. After 24 hours incubation, telomerase activity was found
to be reduced by cisplatin but in contrast, there was no evidence of such a
decrease following melphalan, in agreement with previous studies. However,
after 44 hours in drug free medium, telomerase activity was reduced after
treatment with cisplatin or melphalan. This suggests the rate of loss of
telomerase activity may be drug dependent.
Growth inhibition of Susa CP cells using the Sulphurhodamine B assay ( SRB)
showed the IC55 of cisplatin and melphalan to be 0.73pM and 0.80pM
respectively. Thus although the drug doses used to study telomerase inhibition
were high, each was used at equivalent toxicities (100x its IC50). Furthermore,
at the drug exposures used, the time courses for apoptosis induction were found
to be similar for both drugs. Thus the differential effect on telomerase
inhibition may not simply be due to different overall rates of cell death.
P40 PREFERENTIAL INDUCTION OF APOPTOSIS IN
MULTIDRUG RESISTANT CELLS BY PDMP, AN
INHIBITOR OF CERAMIDE METABOLISM
K.M. Nicholson*, D.M. Quinn, G.L. Kellett and J.R. Warr. Dept. of Biology,
University of York, POBox 373, York, YO1 5YW
A novel approach by which multidrug resistance may be circumvented involves
exploiting oiocnemical dirterences between multidrug resistant (nidr) and sensitive
cells to selectively kill mdr cells. Several changes in lipid composition between mdr
and sensitive cells have been identified, with recent reports suggesting that mdr cells
have higher levels of glucosylceramide than sensitive cells which may function in the
maintenance of mdr (Lavie et al. (1996) JfBiol.Cshem. 271: 19530-19536).
Glucosylceramide is formed from ceramide, a second messenger involved in apoptosis
induction, by glucosylceramide synthase. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate
the effects of glucosylceramide and ceramide on a series of mdr cells by altering
ceramide metabolism with PDMP, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase. The
sensitive cell line, KB-3-1and its mdr counterparts, KB-Cl, KB-Al and KB-VI cells
were exposed to PDMNP. Viability was assessed using a colony formation assay and,
the mean Dl0values (concentration required to reduce the colony forming ability of
cells to 10%of controls) of 38.47 ± 6. 1 pM for KB-3-1 cells, 15.11 ± 2.63pMfor
KB-Cl (t-test, p<O 01), 32.26 ± 11.98gM for KB-AI and 21.44 ± 5.97gMfor KB-V1
cells (p<0.01) suggest that mdr cells were preferentially killed by PDMP. To
determine the mechanism of cell death behind this preferential killing in terms of
induction of apoptosis or necrosis, the nuclear morphology of cells was assessed using
Hoechst 33342, Annexin-V and propidium iodide labelling following a 24 hour
exposure to 75.M PDMP (see table). It is apparent that the main mechanism behind
cell death in the mdr cells is via an induction of apoptosis.
Mean %of cells ± SD

KB-3-1 77.07 ± 6.23 13.69 4.74 9.24 4.71
KB-Cl 53.79± 11.63 (p<0.01) 34.85 9.68 (p<0.01) 11.74 4.06

KB-VI 38.49± 16.04 (p<O.01) 54.59 16.26 (p<0.01) 7.47 2.04
Atimecourse of apoptosis induction and poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase cleavage was
followed and it was apparent that apoptosis was initiated after approximately 6 hours
of PDMP treatment in the mdr cells. Thus, altering ceramide metabolism may be
beneficial inthe selective killing of mdr cells since these cells, with their increased
dependence on glucosylceramide, are more susceptible to apoptosis.

r'4i OVERCOMING CISPLATIN RESISTANCE WITH THE ^
BIOREDUCTIVE DRUG TIRAPAZAMINE. J.E. Monaghan and I.J.
Stratford. School Of Pharmacy And Pharmaceutical Sciences, University Of
Manchester.
The presence of low oxygen conditions (or hypoxia) in solid tumours is a major
hindrance to current therapies, rendering tumour cells resistant to both radiotherapy and
many chemotherapies. Tirapazamine, TPZ (SR4233, Win 59074). is a benzotriazene-
di-N-oxide which under hypoxic conditions is reduced to a free radical capable of
abstracting hydrogen from DNA causing single and double strand DNA breaks. Thus,
TPZ is selectively toxic towards hypoxic cells and it is currently in clinical trials in
combination with cisplatin. These trials are based on pre-clinical work of Dorie and
Brown (1993, 1997) who demonstrated substantial synergistic interaction between these
two agents. However, in these studies there is no indication whether cells inherently
resistant to cisplatin could be specifically sensitized by prior treatment with TPZ.
Therefore, we have examined the effect of the drug combination on a panel of five
breast cancer cell lines that show a 50 fold range in cisplatin sensitivity (IC5o values
ranging from 9 to 530pM following a 1 hour exposure). Cells have been exposed to
varying concentrations of TPZ for 3 hours in hypoxia, then allowed to reoxygenate for
two hours prior to treatment with varying concentrations of cisplatin for 1 hour in air.
The MTT cell proliferation assay was used three days later to determine values of IC50.
Data has been analyzed by assessing the change in hypoxic TPZ ICso at concentrations
ofcisplatin ranging from I to 10lM. Generally IC50 values decrease (i.e. cells become
more sensitive) as the cisplatin dose increases. In MDA 231 tumour cells, the IC5o dose
for aerobic exposure to cisplatin for one hour is 471.0 ± 52.7 pM. A 10,pM dose
reduces the tirapazamnine IC5o of this cell line four-fold. In contrast, in the cisplatin-
sensitive cell line MDA 468 (ICso=9pm), the 10 pm cisplatin dose is required to reduce
the tirapazamine IC50 4-fold. Thus, at an equal dose of cisplatin the synergistic
interaction between TPZ is similar in cell lines with widely varying cisplatin sensitivity.
However, it is likely that, if viewed on the basis of equal cisplatin toxicity, those cells
showing greatest resistance to cisplatin will show the greatest synergistic effect when
they are treated with both drugs. Experiments to confirm this are currently being
carried out.
P43 XR9576, A NOVEL POTENT MODULATOR OF
P-GLYCOPROTEIN-MEDIATED MULTIDRUG RESISTANCE.

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle
to the successful treatment of cancer. This current study demonstrates the
efficacy of XR9576, a novel potent inhibitor of P-gp. XR9576 (an anthranilic
acid derivative) was able to sensitize a panel of human and murine MDR cell
lines derived from various tumour types (EMT6 ARL.0, H69/LX4, 1847AD,
2780AD, MC26) to a broad range of clinically relevant cytotoxics (doxorubicin,
vincristine, taxol, etoposide, actinomycin D and colchicine). In cytotoxicity
assays over 4-6 days, XR9576 fully reversed resistance when used at 30-100
nM, and half maximal reversal was seen at 12-40 nM. By contrast, PSC 833
which is currently undergoing clinical trials in the treatment of MDR cancer,
showed maximal effects at 250-500 nM. In transport studies, inhibition of P-gp
dependent [3H]-daunorubicin efflux was achieved at low nanomolar
concentrations, and half maximal reversal of the accumulation deficit was seen
at 38 ±18 nM. This activity was maintained for in excess of 22 hours after
removal of XR9576 from the incubation medium when cells had been
preincubated with 200 nM XR9576. This prolonged duration of action suggests
that, unlike, cyclosporin A or verapamil, XR9576 is not transported by P-gp.
XR9576 does not reverse drug accumulation deficit in a multidrug resistance-
associated protein (MRP) expressing NSCLC cell line (COR-L23/R). This
indicates that XR9576 is a selective inhibitor ofP-gp.
In vivo, XR9576 showed efficacy in mice bearing both murine and human
tumours. XR9576 (either p.o. or i.v.; 2.5 tolO mg/kg) significantly enhanced the
effect ofdoxorubicin compared to doxorubicin alone in the intrinsically resistant
MC26 tumour model. In athymic mice bearing human H69/LX4 MDR tumours,
XR9576 (p.o. or i.v.; 4-24 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the antitumour
activity of etoposide. Furthermnore, comparison of body weights indicated that
the combination schedules were well tolerated.
These studies demonstrate XR9576 to be an extremely potent and effective
modulator of P-gp mediated MDR and holds great promise in the treatment of
refractory cancers.
P42 ACCENTUATION OF TNF-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN HELA
CELLS USING INHIBITORS OF THE CHYMOTRYPTIC
ACTIVITY OF PROTEASOME, B. Walker", A. Healy2 and J.F. Lynas2, 'Dept. of
Biochemistry, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland, 2School of Biology and
Biochemistry, The Queen's University of Belfast, BT7 9BL, Northern Ireland.
The pluripotent cytokine, TNFa, is known to cause apoptosis in tumour cells
containing its cognate p55 receptor. However, the extent of apoptosis in these target
cells is attenuated by the activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor
NFicB, processes that are also initiated by the binding of TNFa to p55. The key steps
in the activation and translocation of NFKB are the phosphorylation and subsequent
proteasome-mediated proteolysis of a protein called IKBa, which binds to and
sequesters this transcription factor in the cytoplasm.
The inhibition of the proteasome-mediated proteolysis of IKcBa would therefore result
in the blockade of NFKB nuclear translocation and, presumably, the NFKB-induced
expression of the protective genes which limit the extent of apoptosis (1,2).
We have developed a series of peptidyl a-keto aldehyde inhibitors of the chymotryptic
activity of proteasome, one of which Bzl-Leu-Leu-Leu-COCHO (I), inhibits the
enzyme with a K, of - 3.0 nM (3).
We now wish to report that this inhibitor greatly accenuates the TNFa-induced
apoptosis in HeLa cells, when used at concentrations of 10 ,uM (see Table).

P44 SELECTIIVE SENSITISATION OF TUMOUR CELLS
TO THE INDUCTION OF APOPTOSIS WITH INHIBITORS OF
P13-KINASE AND PKC. D. O'Gorman, A. McGahon and T.G.
Cotter, Dept. of Biochemistry, University College Cork, Ireland.
The induction of apoptosis is the mechanism through which a variety
of cytotoxic drugs kill tumour cells. The precise sub-cellular pathway
through which any of these drug initiates apoptosis is as yet unclear.
In the present communication we demonstrate that the use of selective
protein kinase inhibitors sensitises HL-60 tumour cells to the
induction of apoptosis. In this respect Wortmannin and LY294002,
both inhibitors of P13 kinase, enhance the induction of apoptosis in
these tumour cells by up to two fold. These data indicate that PI3
kinase is essential for cell survival and when inhibited an enhancement
of the rate of apoptosis induced in this case by actinomycin D,
Camptothecin, etoposide and cycloheximide is seen. This is in line
with some recently published work indicating a role for P13 kinase as
an anti-apoptotic survival factor. Our data also indicates that PI3
kinase does not mediate its survival effects through the p7OS6 kinase
pathway. Protein kinase C (PKC) like PI3 kinase has also been
suggested to play a key role in the regulation of apoptosis. Using a
series of PKC inhibitors including PMA, staurosporine and calphostin
C we were able to demonstrate that inhibition of PKC by calphostin
C, but not the other two agents, increased the sensitivity of HL-60
cells by 2-3 three fold to the induction of apoptosis by a number of
cytotoxic agents. Experimental data suggests that calphostin C may
act by its selective inhibition of PKC zeta. The use of P13 kinase or
selective PKC inhibitors in conjunction with cytotoxic agents may
open a novel therapeutic strategy for the killing of tumour cells.

P45 CHEMOTHERAPY INDUCES APOPTOSIS IN
HUMAN RETINOBLASTOMA. ENHANCEMENT
BY SODIUM BUTYRATE. MC Madigan*, RM Conway, G. Chaudhri, FA
Billson and PL Penfold; Dept. Clinical Ophthalmology, Uni. of Sydney, Australia
Retinoblastoma (Rb), derived from retinal neuroepithelial cells,
is the most common intraocular malignancy of childhood, and has
traditionally been treated by enucleation or radiation of the affected eye.
Recently, chemotherapy/cyclosporine A combined with laser or
cryotherapy has been used as an alternative therapy for Rb. In this
study, we assessed the effects of vincristine (VN) and cisplatin (CP)
on cell death in human Rb cell lines (Y79 and WERI-Rbl), and
investigated the potential of sodium butyrate (SB), which can induce
dose-dependent apoptosis or differentiation in Rb (1), to augment
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.
The dose-response of Rb cell lines to VN and CP was
established (LD50 1-IOjiM). Cultures treated with lOiiM VN or CP
were assessed using cell morphology, DNA stains and DNA
electrophoresis. The effects of cycloheximide (CHM) and actinomycin
D (AD), and endonuclease inhibitors zinc sulphate (Zn) and
aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) were also assessed. Rb cells were also
exposed to combined chemotherapy/SB<2mM and examined as above.
VN and CP induced dose-dependent cell death in Rb cell lines,
with features characteristic of apoptosis including morphological
changes and DNA fragmentation. CHM and AD significantly reduced
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, although endonuclease inhibitors (Zn
and ATA) had no apparent effect. Treatment of Rb cells with VN or CP
combined with SB<2mM significantly enhanced cell death compared to
chemotherapy alone.
Chemotherapy drugs induced dose-dependent apoptosis in Rb
cell lines, which was enhanced when combined with SB. These
observations may have implications for the treatment of Rb with
chemotherapy.

P47 IRINOTECAN PLUS OXALIPLATIN ± G-CSF AS
SECOND LINE THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED 5-

Vienna, Lathan Inst.-Dortmund and Wr.Neustadt General Hospital, Austria.
Between May and December 1997, thirty-three patients (pts) with measurable
metastatic CC that had relapsed (within 3 months after cessation) or progressed
during palliative 5-FU/LV-based therapy were treated with a combination
regimen, consisting of irinotecan 80 mg/m2 (days 1+8+15) and oxaliplatin
85mg/m2 (days 1+15) ±G-CSF (Smcg/kg given subcutaneously on 5
consecutive days depending on the actual granulocyte counts on days 1 and 15
of the cycle). Treatment courses were repeated every 4 weeks. 29 pts (12
female, 17 male) are currently evaluable for response and toxicity assessment.
Their median age is 61 (31-70) years, and their median WHO performance
status 1 (0-2); 11 had single and 18 had .2 metastatic sites. The median
duration of 5-FU/LV 1st -line therapy was 1 month (range 1-6). After a
median of 5 treatment cycles (range 2-6), nine partial responses (31 %) were
observed, and 12 additional pts (41%) had stable disease. Median response
duration, time to progression and survival time have not been reached yet.
Haematologic side effects were commonly encountered, though they were
generally mild to moderate [ leukocytopenia 26 pts, WHO grade 4: 2 pts (7%);
thrombocytopenia 10 pts, WHO grade 3: 2 pts (7%)]. Dose-limiting side effects
were mainly gastrointestinal [diarrhea: 22 pts, WHO grade 3: 6 pts (21%);
emesis 21 pts, WHO grade 3: 5 pts (17%)] and required dose attenuations (i.e.,
deletion of irinotecan on day 8) in 9 cases (31%). Other adverse reactions
comprised alopecia (19 pts), mild peripheral neuropathy (3 pts), phlebitis (2
pts), and minor infections (3 pts).
These encouraging preliminary response- and acceptable toxicity data warrant
further clinical evaluation to define the role of combined irinotecan and
oxaliplatin : GCSF in the treatment of patients with advanced CC failing 5-
FU/LV-based therapy.
P46 SURFACE - ATTACHED DNA FRAGMENTS FOR
IMMUNOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF DRUG-DNA
INTERACTIONS: APPLICATION TO MELPHALAN ADDUCTS. McCartney,
H., Martin, A.M. and *Tilby, M.J. Cancer Res. Unit, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K.
Background: Two previously described monoclonal antibodies (MP5/73, Amp4/42)
recognise adducts formed in polymeric DNA by the aromatic alkylating agent and
anti-cancer drug melphalan. These antibodies are being used to study clinical and
experimental samples but available evidence regarding their specificity was
inconsistent.MP5/3 appears to recognise adducts at N7-guanine and Amp4/42,
the alkali-induced ring opened N7-guanine adducts. Objectives: 1. To establish the
use of DNA fragments covalently attached to the surfaces of microtitre wells for
detailed analysis of reactions of drugs with DNA, chemical modifications to the
adducts and immunological detection of reaction products. 2. To apply this approach
initially to investigate the specificity of the antibodies against melphalan-DNA
adducts. Methods: DNA fragments were chemically cross-linked, via terminal
5'phosphate, to micro-wells using a published method. After exposure to melphalan
and then to NaOH solution for various times, antibodies were added, followed by l-
galactosidase detection reagents to give a fluorescence signal. Results: If the
hypothesised specificities of the antibodies were correct, alkali-induced loss of
immunoreactivity to MP5/73 should occur at the same rate as gain of
immunoreactivity to Amp4/42. In initial studies, DNA in solution was exposed to
radioactive drug and then alkali. Analysis by radiochemical and competitive ELISA
techniques indicated that gain of immunoreactivity to Amp4/42 occurred several fold
faster than loss of immunoreactivity toMP5/73 (In 0.IM NaOH, the half-lives were
estimated to be <3mins and 12 mins respectively). This was not consistent with the
presumed antibody specificities. The use of surface attached DNA permitted more
detailed, flexible and rapid investigations. Immunoassay signal was linearly
dependent upon drug concentration in a lh exposure, consistent with the signal
being directly proportional to adduct level, however, alkali-induced reactions
appeared slower than in free solution. A difference in rates of alkali-induced changes
assayed by each antibody were seen but, after addition of 0.1M NaOH to wells
carrying alkylated DNA, the change of immunoreactivity to MP5/73 exhibited a
clear delay before decaying with a half-life of about l8mins. Gain of Amp4/42
immunoreactivity showed no delay and exhibited a similar half-life. The use of
immobilised DNA and defined sequence oligonucleotides could be particularly useful

Treatment options for advanced hepatocellular cancer (HCC) are
limited by the drug-refractory nature of this disease. Based on
preliminary results, we have performed a phase I1 study ofthe long
acting somatostatin (SST) analogue lanreotide (LAN) in 21
untreated patients with advanced HCC not amenable to surgery.
Treatment consisted of 30 mg LAN administered by deep
intramuscular injection every 14 days until documented disease
progression. No hematologic side effects were seen with this
application schedule, 3 patients each developed mild nausea and
meteorism attributable to treatment, 1 patient had diarrhea WHO-
grade 1, while 2 patients developed steatorrhea. Arthralgia, short
lasting vertigo and erythema at the injection site was experienced
by 1 patient each. Only 1 patient (5%) showed a partial response, 8
patients had stable disease (38%), while the remaining patients
progressed during treatment. The median survival was 4.2 months
(range 1.2-13+), and the median time to progression was 2.5
months (range 1.5-7+). However, 4 patients (19%) had an
increasein WHO performance status lasting between 2.5 and 6
months, 5 patients (24%) had an increase in body weight, while
pain markedly improved in 1 additional patient (5%). In total, 5
patients (24%) had a decrease in serum AFP-levels at least 30%.
Despite the disappointing results in terms ofobjective response, we
feel that a subjective benefit in roughly 35% is noteworthy in this
group of patients. Further in vitro and in vivo investigations seem
indicated to define the exact therapeutig potential of SST-analogues.

Bleomycin (BLM) is a water-soluble glycopeptide used in combination
chemotherapy against germ cell tumours such as testicular teratoma and ovarian
cancer, resulting in a 90% response rate in the case of the former. However
treatment with BLM is hampered by a serious pulmonary fibrosis occurring in
between 5% and 10% of patients with a 2% mortality rate (Levi et al (1993) J
Clin Oncol 11 1300). This can lead to the death of potentially curable patients
and is related to cumulative dose, renal impairment, adjunctive classic
radiotherapy, the use of supplemental oxygen or the patient being aged over 70
(Comis (1992) Sem Oncol 2 S5 64; Jules-Elysee and White (1990) Clin in Chest
Med 11 1). Classic studies have shown that continuous infusion is more effective
and less toxic than intermittent treatment (Cooper and Hong (1981) Cancer Treat
Rep 65 419). Previous pre-clinical studies have shown that doxorubicin vesicles
circulate in the blood for prolonged periods following intravenous administration
and provide a depot of drug, resulting in improved tumoricidal activity (Uchegbu
et al (1995) Pharm Res 12 1019). The objective of the current study is to
formulate a controlled release particulate BLM formulation in an effort to reduce
the toxicity ofthis drug.

The human pim- 1 proto-oncogene was first cloned from the B-cell
leukaemia 380 cell line and from a human genomic library (Nagarajan et. al.,
1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Vol 83, p. 2556). The mRNA of the pim-
proto-oncogene is 2.9Kb length. A full length pim- 1 cDNA was cloned from the
human chronic mylogenous leukaemia cell line K562. The pim- 1 cDNA Open
Reading Frame is 939 nucleotides and encodes for a 313 amino acid protein
(Domen et. al., 1987, Oncogene Research, Vol 1, p. 103).
We investigated human pim- 1 proto-oncogene expression in four Non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines; Daudi, MCI 16, Namalwa and Raji. Our data
indicate that pim- 1 is overexpressed in all of these cell lines. We also cloned the
full length pim- I cDNA from the Raji cell line.
We have investigated the role of pim- 1 in regulating entry into apoptosis in
these cell lines by transfecting them with pim- sense and antisense constructs.
Our data suggest that the down regulation of pim- I expression in these cell line
results in a high rate of apoptosis whereas pim- 1 overexertion leads a small but
detectable increase in apoptosis compared to control cells.
BLM polymeric vesicles were prepared from palmitoyl glycol chitosan (GCP41)
and cholesterol by remote loading in response to an ammonium sulphate gradient
(Haran et al (1993) Biochem Biophys Acta 1151 201). Briefly, GCP41
ammonium sulphate vesicles were incubated with BLM and BLM was found to
traverse the membrane and accumulate within these vesicles. These GCP41
based BLM vesicles were 600nm in size and had an encapsulation efficiency of
0.5U BLM:lmg GCP41. BLM polymeric vesicles were stable at room
temperature for 28 days. The GCP41 based BLM vesicles also demonstrated good
plasma stability, with 70% BLM remaining encapsulated over 24 hours.
This is the first report of a large molecular weight drug being loaded into
polymeric vesicles by a remote loading method. GCP41 based BLM vesicles are
to undergo in vivo testing.

Introduction: To successfully metastasise tumour cells must have an immune escape
capability. The fact that tumour cells invade, survive and grow in an
immunologically hostile environment of lymph nodes demands a substantial
explanation. While the exact mechanism(s) of immune evasion/ immunosupression
is still uncertain we have shown that tumour and tumour derived cell lines secrete
immunosupressive factors and Fas ligand that can induce apoptosis in activated
lymphocytes in vitro. In this study, we provide evidence for significant apoptosis of
lymphocyte populations in tumour draining lymph and investigated the role of
tumour cell derived Fas ligand as the mediator of this apoptosis. Methods &
Materials: At surgery, peripheral blood, tumour draining lymph nodes were
obtained from 62 patients with Colorectal carcinoma. Apoptosis was detected and
quantified by Flow Cytometry and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Using Annexin
V. which preferentially binds to phosphatidylserine, an early marker ofapoptosis, we
examined and quantified the apoptotic sub populations.Preserved fixed sections of
these apoptotic lymph nodes were inmunohistochemically stained for Cytokeratin,
Tunel( another marker for apoptosis), Fas receptor and Fas ligand. Results:
Apoptosis, as measured a number oftechniques was detected in 58% ofpatients with
Colorectal carcinoma. Apoptosis ranged from 0% (0 of 7) in Dukes A, 58% (19 of
33) in Dukes B, 47%/ (8 of 17) in Dukes C, 82% (9 of 11) in Dukes D. Apoptosis
correlated with a reduction in the CD3+ T- cell population in tumour draining lymph
nodes, specifically there was a more significant and selective reduction in CD8+ T-
cells in apoptotic lymph nodes. Dual labelling on the Flow Cytometer with Annexin-
V and CD3, CD4 and CD8, respectively confirmed apoptosis in the T-lymphocyte
population. Microscopic examination of the paraffin embedded lymph nodes showed
apoptosis in lymphocytes using Tunel and also showed that tumour deposits were
positive for Fas Ligand. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a concomitant
expression of high levels of Fas ligand by metastatic tumour cells and upregulated
Fas ligand receptor by reactive CD8+ T-cells supporting the Fas counter attack
hypothesis in vivo. We propose that Fas ligand expression by metastatic tumour cells
is a major immune evasion/privilege mechanism facilitating invasion of the immune
system itself, namely the lymph nodes.

In patients with carcinoma in situ of the bladder, 30% do not or only
partially respond to BCG therapy. The immune response induced by BCG is
believed to be mediated by T cells and might be improved by concurrent
augmentation of tumour immunogenicity. Transfection of B7 costimulatory
molecules confers an antigen presenting capacity to certain cancer cells. We
investigated the ability of bladder cancer cells engineered to express B7
molecules to directly activate antigen-specific T cells.
The J82 transitional cell carcinoma line was separately transfected
with B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86). Clones were selected for high level
expression of these ligands. Wild type J82, B7-1+, and B7-2+ transfectants
were induced to express class 11 MHC antigens by treatment with IFN-y; none
of these cells could induce proliferation of immunomagnetically purified
allogeneic CD4+ T cells in vitro. However, the transfected B7 molecules were
demonstrated to provide functional signals in an assay of costimulation.
Soluble factors capable of exerting an immunosuppressive effect
were not found to be secreted by the J82 cell line. Expression of Fas (CD95)
ligand by J82 cells was demonstrated at RNA level by reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction and at protein level by western blot and flow
cytometric analysis. Application of both [3HJthymidine-DNA-fragmentation
and TUNEL assays of lymphocyte apoptosis indicated that J82 cells induce
the specific death of activated T cells.
We demonstrate that bladder cancer cells can be engineered to
provide costimulatory signals, though this is not sufficient to allow direct
activation of antigen-specific T cells by the J82 cell line in vitro. Moreover,
induction of apoptosis may occur in activated T cells which encounter bladder
cancer cells expressing Fas-L. Enhancement of tumour immunogenicity is of
limited use if resistance to BCG therapy is associated with acquired
mechanisms of immune escape. The provision of costimulatory signals
should be considered within a broader range of T cell regulatory processes.

The product ofthe Retinoblastoma (Rb) gene has a critical role
not only in tumor suppression but also in the regulation ofcell
growth and differentiation. In contrast to the loss of pRb reported
in several non G.I. malignancies, pRb is overexpressed in
colorectal cancer (CRC). In order to address what might induce a
recessive cancer gene to become overexpressed in CRC we
analysed a transcription factor E2F- I that binds to
unphosphorylated pRb in the GI phase ofcell cycle control.
Western Blotting was carried out on a group of 32 CRC surgical
specimens (each with its normal control), and 2 CRC cell lines,
(SW480, SW620). Monoclonal antibodies (Pharmingen) were
used for all '3 proteins: pRb, unphosphorylated pRb, E2F-1. We
have found 21/32 (65%) tumors have increased pRb expression;
19/32 (59%) tumors have increased unphosphorylated pRb
expression; and 31/32 (97%) tumors have increased E2F-I
expression. Within the cell lines the results mirrored the events in
CRC. Using the E2F- 1 antibody an additional band was observed
at II Okd, which may represent a pRb-E2F- I associated complex
and this was also found to be increased in tumors compared to the
normals by 22/32 (69%).
In conclusion, failure ofincreased pRb in CRC to inhibit
proliferation may be related to an overall increase in the E2F- 1
transcription factor.

But)yrate, a naturally occurring factor derived from the diet, and
transforming growth factor P3 (TGFPI) are growth inhibitory to colonic
adenoma cell lines, inducing a GI arrest. Butyrate induces apoptosis in
adenoma cell lines vhich is preceded by the induction of two markers of
colonic differentiation - alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and E-
cadherin protein expression. TGFD3 can be growth inhibitory without
apoptosis in adenoma cell lines, however, the adenoma cell line
PC/BH/Cl undergoes apoptosis in response to TGFI3,. In contrast to
butyrate, TGFf3,-induced apoptosis was not accompanied by induction of
differentiation markers. It is possible that the apoptosis induced by
TGFr3 in the adenorma cell line PC/BH/CI is due to conflicting signals.
as downregulation of c-mrc protein in response to TGFD3 occurs only
slowly in this cell line. Development of resistance to TGFfB in colonic
tumours may involve two separate stages - resistance to growth
inhibition and resistance to TGFfI-induced apoptosis. In response to
butyrate, apoptosis is mediated via decreased levels of Bcl-2 or increased
levels of Bak, depending on the genetic background of the cells, whereas
levels of Bax remain unchanged. In association wvith TGFf3-induced
apoptosis, BcI-2 levels are reduced, but levels of Bak and Bax remain
constant. As for butyrate, the induction of E-cadherin expression is a
potentially important chemopreventive action, since increased E-
cadherin expression has been correlated with decreased metastatic
potential. Butyrate may reduce tumour growvth and invasion, not only as
a result of the induction ol apoptosis. but also through increased
expression of F -cadherill.

Abnormalities of both apoptosis and proliferation have
previously been demonstrated in colorectal cancer, but the
relationship between the two has received little experimental
attention.
We aimed to establish the relationship between proliferation
and apoptosis in normal mucosa, to demonstrate the derangement in
cancer and to see if the departure from the normal model correlated
with pathological grade.
Samples of carcinoma and mucosa were isolated and
pathological grade assessed following 41 colectomies. Each was
mechanically disaggregated and suspended in saline. Half was mixed
with propidium iodide and analysed by flow cytometry to measure cell
cycle phase fractions. Half was fixed, then incubated with fluorescent
tagged deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotides and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase to label the DNA breaks characteristic of
apoptosis. Flow cytometry was used to analyse the cell suspension
and an apoptotic proportion calculated.
Proliferation (measured by the S-phase fraction) varied widely
in both the tumours (mean 15.8%+SD13.0) and the mucosal
specimens(mean 10.5%±SD6.6), as did apoptosis (tumours
18.1%±16.9 v. 28.1±18.0 for mucosa) with increased proliferation
(P=0.019) and reduced apoptosis (P=0.017) in the tumours.
A linear relationship was demonstrated between apoptosis
and S-phase fraction in the mucosal specimens (P=0.018). This
relationship was lost in the specimens of carcinoma. Worse stages
and grades of tumour diverged from the normal model no more than
better ones.
This study demonstrates that the control of apoptosis and
proliferation are closely related in normal mucosa and that this
process is deranged in cancer, but the derangement is no more
severe in worse stage or grade tumours.

Reports on the reponse of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines
with differing p53 status to DNA damage in terms of cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis have led to confusion. This may be partly due to the
nature of the specific mutation under examination, but can largely be
attributed to differences and problems with methodology and data
analysis (for example the inappropriate use of static DNA histograms
for cell cycle analysis). Taking seven lymphoblastoid cell lines. we have
completed a detailed study of the cell cycle and apoptotic responses of
these cells to gamma radiation. The lines were derived from both normal
individuals and Li-Fraumeni/Li-Fraumeni-Like individuals carrying p53
mutations. Using BrdUrd pulse labelling, the cells were followed over
the course of six hours and analysed by flow cytometry. Results
showed that, regardless of p53 status, the cells did not arrest at the GI
checkpoint even though in all of the cell lines p53 was shown to up-
regulate within three hours of irradiation. However, the irradiated cells
did show a general slowing both in entry into the S-phase from GI and
in movement through S-phase. All cells demonstrated the expected G2
arrest following irradiation. To assess apoptotic response to radiation in
these cell. lines a variety of techniques were evaluated. A variant of the
TUNEL assay using flow cytometry and morphology were selected as
being the most reliable. An increase in radiation-induced apoptosis was
seen in all cell lines. There was a trend for cell lines with a mutant p53
allele to have both higher constitutive levels of apoptosis and a slightly
increased apoptotic response compared to the control cell lines.

The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular events mediated
by p53 following exposure of cells in vivo to ionising radiation. In adult
mouse skin, distinct populations of keratinocytes respond to p53 stabilisation
by entering an apoptotic pathway or executing a cell cycle block.
Apoptosis, as determined both by in situ tunnel assay and by
morphology is restricted to the matrix region of the hair follicle and can be
detected 4hrs after exposure to 4Gy ionising radiation. BrdU labelling studies
demonstrate that matrix cells are capable of entering the apoptotic pathway
from G2/M, as well as G 1.
Interfollicular and non matrix follicular cells respond to radiation by
initiating a cell cycle block, as measured by BrDu incorporation, which is
detectable 24hrs after exposure to 4Gy. Pre treatment of skin with the tumour
promoter TPA, which induces an increase in cellular proliferation rate, results
in a cell cycle block within 4hrs of radiation exposure in the same cell
population. Similarly, highly proliferative two week old mouse skin shows a
cell cycle block 4hrs after exposure to radiation. Both cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis following radiation. are p53 dependent, as they are not detected in
p53 knockout mice after radiation exposure.
These results suggest that cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following
exposure of mouse epidermis to ionising radiation is cell type specific. The
timing of cell blockage after damage is dependant on the proliferative state of
the cell. However, ability to enter the apoptotic pathway is independent of
cellular proliferation rate and seems likely to be dependent on the
differentiation status ofthe cell.

Radiation induced genomic instability may be an important contributor to carcinogenesis.
The aim of this work was to investigate the initial and delayed frequency of micronucleated cells
and apoptosis after irradiation. X-ray and a-particle irradiation were carried out in AGO1522B
primary human fibroblasts.
Cells were allowed to grow under normal proliferative conditions, without the use of
cytochalasin B. Micronuclei were scored using daughter cell analysis on acridine orange
stained cells. Apoptosis was assessed by morphological criteria on acridine orange stained
samples, by DNA fragmentation with in situ 3-OH DNA end-labelling and by detection of
phosphatidylserine expression on the outer surface of the cell membrane with Annexin V.
We have shown in our experiments that there are significant differences between X-ray and
a-particle irradiated fibroblasts in both the yields and time-course of micronuclei production. An
initial peak in micronuclei and apoptosis yield is found 3 days after both, X-ray and a-particle
irradiation. In the case of 3 Gy of a-particles a delayed peak on day 8 was observed. Both
types of irradiation also induced delayed genomic instability at later times (8-30 days). a-
particle irradiation is more efficient in producing genomic instability and, in the case of higher
doses, the peak in micronuclei formation and apoptosis is at later times. The existence of
genomic instability was also confirmed by cell survival assays on day 0, 8, 14 and 24 after
irradiation. In comparison with short term samples, damaged cells scored at later times are
more frequently found to be heavily micronucleated. Also, at later times, apoptosis became a
greater contributor to total cellular damage than micronuclei production.
We find that micronuclei and apoptosis frequency curves, at early and delayed times have
a similar time dependency. Morphologically, it is difficult to distinguish between apoptosis and
heavily micronucleated cells. An in situ 3-OH DNA end-labelling technique was employed to
confirm detection of apoptotic cells. It confirmed the time dependence of apoptosis induction but
values were higher than with conventional morphological analysis. A possible reason is that in
situ 3-OH DNA end-labelling is able to detect three different morphological stages of apoptosis,
whereas conventional staining detects only the last stage, fragmentation of the nucleus.
Annexin V detection of phosphatidylserine externalisation, was used as a marker for the early
stages of apoptosis after a-particle and X-rays irradiation. We find that a-particles are more
efficient in apoptosis production then X-rays. Also there are differences in the time course. The
peak of apoptosis production is 1 day after a-particle irradiation with a decrease up to day 6.
The fraction of apoptotic cells remained dose dependent for all time points. For X-rays the
fraction of apoptotic cells starts to increase on day 2 and slowly decreases afterwards,
independently to dose. These experiments confirm that phosphatidylserine expression is an early
event in these irradiated fibroblasts. In control flow cytometry experiments we found that only a
small fraction of fibroblasts detach from the substrate and undergo apoptosis.
We demonstrate in this work an evidence of radiation-induced genomic instability in normal
human fibroblasts which have being cultivated under normal proliferative conditions. The results
suggest a considerable contribution of programmed cell death to total cellular damage,
especially at delayed times after irradiation.

Ionizing radiation is a damage inducing agent in mammalian cells. Cells
adapt to a wide variety of insults by alteration in gene and protein expression'.
Constitutive and inducible genes are known to be regulated by ionizing radiation
but the localization of the trigger for the signalling pathways leading to gene
induction and regulation after ionizing radiation is not yet known2. Membrane
damage has been recently implicated in apoptosis after ionzing radiation3. We are
using a model to test the role of both nuclear and membrane damage in triggering
altered gene expression in mammalian cells. A microdosimetry model has been
employed for the differential irradiation of the human lung epithelial cell line
L132 The model allows absorbed dose calculations to be made for differential
nuclear irradiation after incorporation of3H-thymidine.
Data from nuclear irradiation experiments were compared with the effects
of 300kVp external beam X-rays. We used western blotting to monitor the
regulation of GADD45 after exposure to 300kVp X-rays and GADD45, c-fos and
c-myc after pulsed 3H-thymidine. Following doses of 2, 5 and 10 Gy 300kVp X-
rays GADD45 expression increased progressively in a dose-dependent manner to a
maximum of 3 fold after 48 hr. The response of GADD45 to nuclear irradiation
was markedly different; induction of GADD45 was ofsimilar magnitude (2.5 fold)
to that seen with 300 kVp X-rays, but at total doses that resulted in much less cell
killing. Furthermore, induction was transient after pulsed 3H-thymidine labelling.
The expression of c-fos was also transient and c-myc protein showed a slight,
transient increase after four hours. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis
that a radiation sensitive molecular target for the initiation of signal transduction
for these genes exists in the nucleus of this cell line. The differences between total
cell and nuclear irradiation will require more detailed studies before further
conclusions can be drawn.

Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) uses systemically administered antibodies to direct a therapeutic dose of
radiation to cancer deposits. Animal dosimetry models are useful for understanding and evaluating the
toxicity caused by RIT in tumour and normal tissues and for assessing the potential clinical use of antibodies
for tumour targeting.
Biodistribution experiments give useful information on the localisation and pharmacokinetics of
radiolabelled antibodies and enable the calculation of the dose delivered to each organ. Conventionally,
the dose to the organ is a function of the integration of radioisotope uptake over time. Two simplifying
assumptions often made in the these calculations is that non penetrating beta radiation originating in the
source organ is wholly absorbed in the organ and that the radiopharmaceutical is uniformly distributed in
the source organ. However, we have previously shown, using radioluminography, that the distributions
in bone, kidney and tumour are not uniform. For dosimetry purposes kidney cortex and medulla should
be considered separately as source organs as should bone and marrow. In tumour, antitumour antibodies
predominantly localise in the well vascularised areas with limited access toareas of hypoxia and therefore
presents a more complex problem for absorbed dose calculations. Additionally, mouse organs are relatively
small compared with the range of medium to high energy beta particles. Consequently, a significantamount
of beta radiation energy that originates in one organ can escape and be absorbed in adjacent organs.
We have calculated the absorbed fraction of the beta energy emitted from 9"Y and "I' in mouse organs using
beta dose point kernels. Organs included were the liver, spleen, kidney cortex, kidney medulla, lungs,heart,
stomach, small intestine, large intestine, thyroid, cortical bone and marrow. By measuring the overlapping
surface areas between adjacent organs, the absorbed fraction in adjacent organs was calculated. To account
for radioantibody heterogeneity in tumour, a 3D model was developed by reconstructing the
radioluminographs of serial tumour sections. The dose rate to all parts of the tumour was calculated using
point kernels.
Dose calculations show that the kidney cortex receives a significantly larger dose than the medulla as does
the bone marrow when compared to cortical bone. The tumour model demonstrates that the dose delivered to
the viable radiosensitive part of the tumour is approximately twice the mean tumour dose and four times the
dose delivered to hypoxic areas when using 'Y. When using "'I, the viable cells receive two and half times
the mean tumour dose and up to seven times the dose delivered to hypoxic cells.
We have demonstrated the heterogeneity in dose delivered to the kidney cortex and medulla and the well and
poorly vascularised parts of the tumour using antitumour antibodies, it is likely that similar differences occur
with conventional cytotoxic drugs. This shows the need for the development of similar models for
systemically delivered drugs in order tounderstand the toxicity in the organs of animals. With further
development of the models, we can improve our prediction of the effect of therapy in man.

IN VITRO INVASION IN A COLON CANCER MODEL,
S. Cowell* and P. de Takats, Experimental Metastasis Group, Strangeways
Research Laboratory, Cambridge CB1 4RN.
The process of metastasis requires cells to pass through a basement
membrane. It is widely believed that this ability to cross extracellular matrix
barriers requires the production of active enzymes in order to degrade the
various extracellular matrix components. The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
family of enzymes can degrade many of these components, and many human
cancers have been shown to express increased amounts of MMPs.
In our study, an in vitro model of human colon cancer progression (Williams,
A.C. et al., Cancer Res. 50: 4724-4730, 1990) was chosen to examine
differences in MMP expression between adenoma and carcinoma cells. The
adenoma cell line (AAIC1) was derived from a large human colonic tubular
adenoma, and retains certain characteristics of colon cells such as the
production of mucus glycoproteins. The carcinoma cell line (AA/C1/SB/10C)
was produced by sodium butyrate and N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine
treatment of AA/C1 cells. Only the carcinoma cells increase their migration into
a reconstituted basement membrane upon treatment with epidermal growth
factor (EGF) (Brunton, V.G. et al., Oncogene 14: 283-293, 1997).
We investigated the secretion of latent and active stromelysin, collagenase 3
and gelatinases by these cells using Western blotting, gelatin zymography and
immunocytochemistry. The cells were also examined for urokinase-type
plasminogen activator (u-PA) and membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase
expression, as these enzymes are responsible for the activation of many of the
MMPs. As a measure of invasiveness, we examined the relative abilities of the
two cell lines to pass through transwell filters coated with extracellular matrix
proteins (laminin, type IV collagen, type collagen or fibronectin). Cells were
seeded onto the coated filters and cultured for several days before examining
the filters under a confocal microscope.
The results obtained showed that there were some differences in MMP
expression between the two cell lines. Both cell lines express gelatinase A and
TIMP-1. Treatment with phorbol ester upregulated u-PA and u-PA receptor in
both lines, and gelatinase B and collagenase 3 in AA/C1/SB/10C cells.
However, in our in vitro system their invasive capabilities were similar even in
the presence of EGF or phorbol ester, which may reflect the limitations of this
system as a model for metastasis by colon carcinoma cells.

METALLOPROTEINASES (TIMPs) IN HEPATIC TISSUE
SURROUNDING COLORECTAL CARCINOMA METASTASES. S.R.Kelly*,

Hospital, Tremona Road, Southampton. S016 6YD.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMPs) are a group of
enzymes involved in extracellular matrix breakdown and remodelling. In normal
tissue turnover there is a balance in activity between MMPs and TIMPs, but this
balance is thought to be disrupted in favour of breakdown to facilitate invasion and
metatastic spread in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). We examined the mRNA
expression pattern of TIMP I and 2 in hepatic tissue and CRC metastases.
Fresh tissue obtained from ten patients undergoing hepatic resection for metastases
from CRC was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total cellular RNA was
extracted from the metastasis, the immediately adjacent liver (within 1cm of the
metastasis) and distal liver (>5cm distant), and subjected to reverse transcription
(RT) using an oligo dT primer. RT-PCR was performed using specific
oligonucleotide primers to detect TIMP 1, TIMP 2 and,B-actin (a ubiquitously
expressed gene). The PCR products were analysed by non-denaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualised by ethidium bromide staining
under ultraviolet transillumination. The specificity ofthe PCR products was
confirmed by sequencing.
In all ten patients the liver metastases and distal liver expressed both TIMP I and 2
mRNA at equivalent levels. However in seven of the ten patients TIMP I expression
was lower in the liver tissue immediately adjacent to the metsatasis, and in nine of
the ten patients TIMP 2 expression was lower.
These results suggest that there is down regulation of both TIMP I and 2 in liver
tissue adjacent to hepatic metastases, and that this facilitates local growth of hepatic
metastatic disease.

BLADDER TUMOUR INVASION.

We have established an human bladder organ culture system for the
study of interactions of normal human urothelial cells (Scriven et al; J Urol
1997; 158: 1147) and bladder carcinoma cells (Booth et a/. Lab Invest 1997;
76: 843) with de-epithelialised urothelial stroma. Transitional cell carcinoma
(TCC) cell lines showed three different invasion patterns: well-differentiated
RT4 cells were non-invasive, moderately-differentiated RT1 12 cells invaded
the sub-epithelial capillary bed and anaplastic EJ cells additionally invaded
the stromal matrix.
The aim of this study was to determine if differences in invasive
properties of TCC cell lines were related to the expression and activity of
urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA), its activating receptor (u-PAR),
gelatinases A and B (MMP2 and MMP9) and their inhibitors (TIMP1 and
TIMP2). MMPs secreted by adherent cultured cells were detected by
gelatine zymography and confirmed by immunoblotting.
Immunohistochemical localisation of proteases was carried out on cells
grown in culture and on sections of tissues and organ cultures.
Normal urothelial cells and TCC cell lines produced u-PA and large
quantities of MMP2 and MMP9, of which the majority was in the inactive or
pro-form. Only EJ and RT1 12 cells expressed detectable u-PAR, which was
associated with the cell-surface. EJ cells did not express TIMP2.
These data show that normal and RT4 urothelial cells have the
capacity to produce high levels of proteases in monoculture, but do not
invade when seeded onto a stroma, suggesting that in non-invasive cells,
proteolytic activity is under strict regulation. However, the vascular-invasive
RT1 12 and EJ cell lines both displayed cell surface-localised u-PAR,
suggesting that u-PAR may be an important factor in the process of
intravasation. The lack of expression of TIMP2 by EJ cells may be a factor
in their ability to invade the stromal matrix.

Data from model systems suggest that certain matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) are causally involved in cancer invasion
and metastasis.
The aim of this study was to establish the relationship between two
MMPs, i.e., MMP-2 (gelatinase A, Mr 72,000) and MMP-9
(gelatinase B, Mr 92,000) and metastatic potential in human breast
carcinomas.
Active and latent forms of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were measured by
zymography on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels containing 4% gelatin.
Media from activated HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell lines were used as a
control.
Total (precursor and active) levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were
detected in 70/117 (60%) and 81/118 (69%) of primary breast
carcinomas, respectively. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, higher
levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were found in primary
carcinomas compared to fibroadenomas (n = 15), (p <0.0001 for both
MMPs). Both gelatinases correlated significantly with each other (r =
0.36, p = 0.0001, n = 117). However, neither activities were
significantly associated with established prognostic markers such as
tumour size, nodal status or estrogen receptor status. Using univariate
analysis, high levels of MMP-2, but not MMP-9 activity correlated
with shortened disease free interval (chi square = 6.53, p = 0.0106)
and overall survival (chi square = 4.57, p = 0.0355).
We conclude that both MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities are significantly
higher in primary breast carcinomas than in fibroadenomas.
Furthermore, the correlation between MMP-2 and patient outcome is
consistent with data from model systems implicating this MMP in
cancer invasion and metastasis.

MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES IN DIFFERENT TYPES
P65 OF SKIN CANCER, C. O' Shea*l, T. Maguirel, D. Chin2,
D.S. Soutar2, M J. Duffyl, IDept. of Nuclear Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital,
Dublin 4, 2Dept. of Plastic Surgery, Canniesburn Hospital, Glasgow.
The principal types of skin cancer, i.e., basal cell carcinomas (BCC),
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and malignant melanoma vary
widely in their metastatic potential. Thus, while SCCs, and especially
BCCs rarely metastasise, malignant melanoma frequently give rise to
metastases. The aim ot this work was to investigate the possibility that
the wide difference in the metastatic propensity of these different
types of skin cancer was due to different levels of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of endopeptidases causally
involved in cancer spread.
MMP-1 and 3 levels were measured by ELISA (prototype kits from R
& D Systems) while MMP-2 and 9 activities were determined using
gelatin zymography.
Levels of MMP- 1, 2, 3 and 9 in BCCs and SCCs were not
significantly different. However, for MMP-1, 3 and 9 (both precursor
and active forms), levels were significantly higher in both BCCs and
SCCs compared with the melanomas. For MMP-2, precursor levels
were higher in SCCs compared with melanomas, while for active
MMP-2, activities were higher in BCCs than in melanomas. Within
the combined group of skin tumours, a number of correlations
between the different MMPs were found. Thus, MMP-1 levels
correlated significantly with both the active (r = 0.58, p = 0.0001, n =
44) and precursor forms of MMP-2 (r = 0.37, p < 0.05, n = 44) as well
as MMP-3 levels (r = 0.58, p = 0.0001, n = 45). Similarly, active
MMP-2 levels were significantly associated with MMP-2 precursor
levels (r = 0.64, p = 0.0001, n = 72), MMP-3 levels (r = 0.63, p =
0.0001, n = 49), active MMP-9 levels (r = 0.49, p = 0.0001, n = 72)
and MMP-9 precursor levels (r = 0.53, p = 0.0001, n = 72).
We conclude that in contrast to our findings with uPA, MMP-1, 2, 3
and 9 levels were generally higher in both BCCs and SCCs relative to
malignant melanomas. The low metastatic potential of both BCCs and
SCCs is therefore unlikely to be due to a deficiency of these MMPs.

Degradation of the extracellular matrix by proteolytic enzymnes, including the
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPIs) is a critical event in thc: process of cancer invasion
and metastasis. MIMP-9 which degrades type IV collagen. gelatin and fibronectin is
expressed in a variety ofcancer types such as colon, breast. bladder, ovarian, and prostate
cancer, and its levels appear to be related to malignancy and invasion. In liVo these
enzymes are secreted in a latent form and must be cleaved to yield an active degradative
enzyme. Isolation of antibodies which specifically recognise thle active form of this
enzyme has proved elusive by conventional methods, however this is essential as it is
measurement of the active enzyme that is most clinically relevant. The display of
repertoires of antibody fragments on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage offers a
new way of making antibodies with predefined specificities. Antibody fragments are
displayed by fusion to the viral coat protein, allowing phage with antigen binding
activities and encoding the antibody fragments to be selected by panning on antigen. The
'Nissim Library' developed by the Centre for Protein Engineering, Cambridge (Nissim et
al, EMBO 13, 692-698, 1994) contains over 108 antibody specificities constructed by the
pairing of a single unmutated V light chain gene segment with a diverse repertoire of in
vitro rearranged Vii genes containing a random VH-complementary determining regions3
that are expressed on the surface offilamentous phage.
Approximately 108 single chain Fv(scFv) antibody producing E. co/i TG I
clones underwent 4 rounds ofaffinity selection (panning) to MMP-9 according to Nissim
et al. Samples of polyclonal phage populations taken after each round of panning were
tested by ELISA and showed excellent enrichment of binding activity to MMP-9. To
identify monoclonal phage antibodies the pHEN phage particles were rescued and 82
individual clones from round 4 were screened by phage ELISA against MMP-9. 42 of
the 82 clones (520 o) were tound to be positive. These positive phage clones were then
infected into E. coli H-B2151 and induced for soluble expression of scFv antibody
protein. The production of antibody into periplasm and supemnatant was assessed. After
transferring to HB2 151 72% of clones produced soluble scFv fragments wvhen tested by
ELISA against MMP-9 protein. Culture supernatants were also tested by western blot
using an anti-myc antibody which detects the myc tag on the scFv fragment. Bands can
be seen at 3 IkD for the scFv protein. Antibodies from clones with the greatest 'nding
activity by ELISA were titered and found to be in the range 1/100 dilution.
FUrther characterisation studies on these scFv fragments to MMP-9 are
currently underway. It is hoped that the unlimited supply of these novel antibodies will be
used to develop reagents. which may aid in the treatment and diagnosis of conditions
insols ing [CM degradation.
P66 HIGH LEVELS OF TIMP-1 PREDICT POOR OUTCOME
IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER,

Dept. of Nuclear Medicine and Surgery, St. Vincent's Hospital; Dublin 4, Ireland.
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are Zn-dependent endopeptidases
which catalyse degradation of diverse substrates in the extracellular
matrix. In vivo, activity of these MMPs is controlled by a group of
inhibitors known as TIMPs. In many model systems, metastatic
potential is positively correlated with MMP levels and negatively
associated with TIMP levels.
The aim of this study was to establish the relationship between levels
of TIMP- I and metastatic potential in human breast carcinomas.
Levels of TIMP-1, MMP-l and MMP-3 were determined by ELISA
(Amersham, UK).
Levels of TIMP-1 protein . 0.624 ng/mg protein were detected in
123/139 (89%) primary breast carcinomas. Higher levels of TIMP-1
were found in primary carcinomas compared to fibroadenomas (z =
-2.134, p = 0.0329). TIMP-1 levels correlated significantly with both
MMP-1 and MMP-3 levels (r = 0.203, p = 0.0178 and r = 0.221, p =
0.0(12, respectively). In primary carcinomas, TIMP-1 levels correlated
inversely with ER concentration (r = -0.246, p = 0.004) and positively
with tumour size (r = 0.242, p = 0.0067). Using univariate analysis,
patients with low levels of TIMP-1 protein had a significantly better
survival than patients with higher levels. Using RT-PCR, TIMP-1
mRNA was detected in 51/60 (85%) primary breast carcinomas.
Our results show that TIMP-1, rather than inhibiting breast cancer
progression, may indeed potentiate this process. Similar results have
been found for the urokinase plasminogen activator inhibitor, PAI- 1.

COMPETITIVE RT-PCR.

Background: The MMPs are a family ofproteolytic enzymes which regulate
turnover ofthe extracellular matrix and are implicated in the process oftumour
growth and metastasis. Their inhibition is a novel therapeutic modality. It remains
unclear which member(s) ofthis family are of most functional significance.
Aim: To use RT-PCR to quantify the relative amounts ofMMPs and their tissue
inhibitors (TIMPs) within gastric tumours. To confirm the mRNA findings using
gelatin zymography.
Methods: Gastric carcinoma tissue and normal mucosa were obtained from twenty
resections. mRNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA. Competitive
PCR was performed with a gene specific external standard. Results were
normalised to GAPDH. Zymography was performed to show the active and
inactive forms of MMPs-2 and -9.
Results: mRNAs for MMPs-2, 7 and -9 were expressed significantly more
frequently in tumour than normal mucosa (p-0.05 X). Of the TIMPs. TIMP-2 but
not TIMP-1 was significantly expressed in tumour compared to normal (p=0.05
X'). There was a highly significant increase in the quantity of mRNA for MMPs-2,
and -7 in gastric cancers (p<0.0I Mann-Whitney) and a less marked but
significant increase in TIMP-2 mRNA (p<0.05 Mann-Whitney).There was a trcnd
to significance in the increased expression ofMT-MMP-1 in tumours. Gelatin
zymography revealed both forms ofMMPs-2 and -9 in the tumour samples but
inactive species only in the normal mucosa.
Discussion: Using these two techniques a relative quantity ofeach enzyme within
every sample was obtained at the mRNA level and the presence offunctioning
protein confirmed. When tumour tissue is compared to normal a significant
difference is found for MMPs-2 and -7. These enzymes have a well documented
role in the process of invasion and metastases. A significant increase in the mRNA
for TIMP-2 (capable ofbinding to both the latent and active forms ofMMvP-2) has
also been demonstrated. This work further stresses the importance ofMMP-2 in
the malignant process.

P69 CO-CULTURE OF HUMAN FIBROBLAST AND

EXPRESSION OF FIBROBLAST DERIVED MT-MMP-1.

The Academic Unit of Cancer Studies, Department of Surgery, University
Hospital, Nottingham.
Introduction: Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteolytic enzymes
involved in the turnover of the extracellular matrix and are implicated in the
process of tumour growth and metastases. The interaction between tumour and
stroma is thought to be important in this process. Membrane Type - MMP-I is a
potent activator of pro- MMP-2, and was thought to be linked to tumour cell
surfaces. Evidence now exists that the stromal cells within a tumour mass may
also express MT-MMP-1.
Aims: To examine the expression of MT-MMP-I in a human fibroblast cell line
and to establish ifco-cultivation with colorectal cancer cell lines has an effect on
this expression. To determine if expression of MT-MMP-1 has a subsequent
effect on MMP-2 activation.
Methods: The fibroblast cell line 46BR.IGI was co-cultivated in serum free
medium with the colorectal cancer cell lines: C17OHM2 and AP5LV in
transwell plates separated by 34m porous filters. All assays were conducted for
72 hours, at which point each cell type was harvested and mRNA extracted
using guanidium thiocyanate. mRNA was purified and reverse transcribed to
double stranded cDNA. PCR was performed with the following primer pairs;
MMP's-2, -9, and MT-MMP-1. Conditioned media was subjected to SDS-
PAGE gelatin zymography.
Results: Mono-cultures of the fibroblast cell line expressed mRNA for MMP-2
and -9 but did not express MT-MMP-1 mRNA, however co-culture with the
colorectal cancer lines induced expression of MT-MMP-1 while retaining
expression of MMP-2 and -9. Expression of MT-MMP-1 did not activate pro-
MMP-2.
Conclusions: MT-MMP-l expression is induced in fibroblasts by factors released
by the colorectal cells, cell cell contact may be necessary for MMP-2
activation.

Membrane mediated metalloproteinase (MMP) activity is proposed
to be an essential requirement for the metastatic development ofthe
cancer cell, since it is this activity which is responsible for matrix
remodeling which facilitates the egress ofthe metastatic cell through
basement membrane components into the vasculature. In light ofthis
it is proposed that members ofthe MMP family are instrumental in
cellular dissemination, due to their type IV collagenase activity.
We report here the expression ofseveral members ofdifferent
metalloproteinase families in the breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7
and T47D. Using RT-PCR we detect members ofthe membrane-type
matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) MT-MMP1 and MT-MMP4,
the astacin family meprin a and b and ADAMs family members 10, 12
and 15. all ofwhich are proposed to have active metalloproteinase
domains. Using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and Western
blotting techniques we have demonstrated protein expression of
mepnn and ADAM 10 and 15. Astacin-like activity is exhibited in the
MCF-7 cell line using protein biochemistry.
The cell membrane ofthese tumour cells therefore has a much
larger repertoire ofmembrane-linked metalloproteinase genes than
has previously been reported, which may contribute towards the
development ofthe metastatic phenotype.

AND TIMPs IN COLORECTAL CANCER CELL LINES USING RT-PCR.

The Academic Unit of Cancer Studies, Department of Surgery, University
Hospital, Nottingham.
Introduction: Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic
enzymes involved in the turnover of the extracellular matrix and are implicated
in the process of tumour growth and metastases. Their action is regulated by the
naturally occurring inhibitors, TIMPs. Evidence exists that the "net proteolytic"
activity is of overall importance in the process of metastasis. The interaction
between tumour and stroma is thought to be important.
Aims: To establish a quantitative profile ofMMPs and TIMPs for metastatic and
non-metastatic colorectal cell lines grown in vitro in the absence of any stromal
influence.
Methods: Colorectal cell lines C170 (non-metastatic), C17OHM2 (hepatic
invasive), AP5 (non-metastatic) and AP5LV (lung invasive) were harvested
using EDTA mRNA was extracted using guanidium thiocyanate, purified and
reverse transcribed to double stranded cDNA. Competitive PCR was performed
with the following primer pairs; MMP's-l,-2,-9,-1 1, MT-MMP-l,-2, TIMPs 1.2
and GAPDH. Reactions included a standard multi-competitor cDNA containing
priming sites for each of the MMPs studied and 32p adCTP. The samples were
separated on 6% TBE gels and stained with ethidium bromide, bands were
excised and counts per minute determined using a Top Count. Results were
expressed relative to GAPDH.
Results: mRNA was detected for all primers used with the standard multi-
competitor cDNA. MMP-2 mRNA was not detected in any of the cell lines.
mRNA for MMPs-1 and -9 was only detected in C17OHM2. Soluble MMPs
were not expressed in AP5 or the lung invasive cell line,AP5LV, under the
culture conditions employed, however MT-MMP-1 and TIMP-2 were highly
expressed in both.
Conclusions: The cell lines do not express mRNA for MMP-2. commonly
localised to stromal cells. The net proteolytic activity of the metastatic cell line
(C17OHM2) is potentially greater than the non-metastatic (C170).
IDENTIFICATION OF GENES INVOLVED IN EPITHELIAL
P72 CELL:MATRIX INTERACTIONS BY DIFFERENTIAL
DISPLAY.

The stroma is believed to play a regulatory role in epithelial cell
proliferation and differentiation during homeostasis and tissue regeneration.
Dysregulation of these processes is implicated in the development and
progression of neoplastic disease. We have used differential display RT-
PCR to identify changes in gene expression induced when normal human
urothelial (NHU) cells interact with basement membrane-derived Matrigel
matrices.
Total RNA was extracted from NHU cells grown on Matrigel or
Primaria tissue culture plastic for 24 or 48 hours. After removal of
contaminating DNA, differential display RT-PCR was carried out using 30
primer combinations. The differential display products were analysed on
sequencing gels. 27 bands showed a relative increase in intensity and were
excised from gels, re-amplified and cloned into pGEM3Z. Up to 6 clones
from each band were sequenced and homologies assessed by DNA
database comparisons.
Upregulation of gene expression by cells grown on Matrigel was
confirmed by Ribonuclease Protection Assays (RPA) for 9 independent
sequences, including 4 ESTs and 5 known genes: connexin 26,
macrophage migration inhibition factor (MMIF), cystatin B, elafin and
antileukoprotease. These genes have recognised roles in cell:matrix and
cell:cell interactions, although only connexin 26 expression has previously
been studied in bladder cancer. By RPA, three of the mRNAs (connexin 26,
MMIF and elafin) were absent from urothelium in situ, suggesting that
expression of these genes forms part of the inducible response repertoire of
urothelium.
This approach has identified novel and previously non-implicated
gene products involved in normal urothelial:matrix interactions which may be
significant in the development of invasive and metastatic tumour
phenotypes. Furthermore, the identification of cystatin B (a cysteine
protease inhibitor) and the serine proteinase inhibitors, elafin and
antileukoprotease, raises the possibility that this approach may be useful in
identifying novel protease inhibitors.

METASTATIC PROFILE OF A RENAL CANCER CELL
LINE, D.M.P. Morrow*, A.M. McElligott, S.M. Farragher and H. McGlynn, School
of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ulster at Coleraine, Northern Ireland.
The ability of cells to organise and remodel surrounding extracellular matrix
(ECM) is essential in metastasis, the leading cause of cancer mortality. The matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc dependent enzymes that degrade the
major components of the ECM. The balance between MMPs and their natural
inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) is critical in determining net
MMP activity. Studies of the mechanisms of differential expression of these genes
would lead to better understanding of the metastatic process. We have investigated the
modulation of MMP and TIMP genes in a metastatic renal carcinoma cell line Caki-1,
by the tumour promoter 12-O-teradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, 20ng/ml). The
effect of a 12 hour treatment on MMIP/TIMP gene expression was detenrined by
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The phorbol
ester TPA was seen to enhance the invasive potential of the Caki-l cell line in two
ways. Firstly, TPA compromises the 1:1 stoichiometry of the MMP:TIMP ratio; as
MMP-2 expression is significantly increased, while expression of TIMP-I and TIMP-
2 remained unchanged. Secondly, TPA also increased the expression of membrane-
type MMP-I (MT-MMP-1) which is known to play an important role in the process by
which MMP-2 is activated. MMP-2 activation has been directly correlated with the
aggressiveness of tumour cells.

The integrin superfamily of cell membrane glycoproteins are known to be
involved in the mediation of cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix components
such as fibronectin, laminin and vitronectin. This study has examined the
expression of an extensive array of these integrins in a panel of human germ cell
tumour cell lines.
Determination of the integrin profiles of 7 embryonal carcinoma (EC) and 2
yolk sac carcinoma (YS) human cell lines has been performed via flow cytometric
analysis of indirectly FITC-labelled monoclonal antibodies to cell surface integrins.
Furthermore, analysis via Western blotting is currently being carried out to confirm
integrin expression and assess sub-unit association.
Preliminary flow cytometry data have. so far shown strong expression of the a4
and ,B integrins in all cell lines. In addition CD44 was found to be highly expressed
in EC cells but not in YS cells. Finally, only weak expression of ac, 3 and 35 was
observed for EC cells whereas YS cells were negative for all three.
It is known that EC cells will adhere and spread out on vitronectin. However
when plated on fibronectin they will adopt a more dendritic morphology in their
exploration of the substrate. We hypothesize that microspike extension, substrate
exploration and migration of EC cells occurs on fibronectin and is mediated through
a401 in conjunction with EC cell surface keratan sulphate/chondroitin sulphate
proteoglycan. Currently we are testing this hypothesis by blocking EC cell process
extension and migration with appropriate antibodies to a4 and 31 and by inhibition of
chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan (CSPG). We are also exploring the role of CD44
and determining via immunoprecipitation whether the CD44 being expressed is a
variant of CSPG.

Several studies have implicated the integrin av03 as being
associated with progression towards the invasive forms of
melanoma, although the mechanisms underlying this association are
unknown. To study possible mechanisms we have generated a
recombinant amphotropic retrovirus encoding the human 13 subunit
(pBabe-puro 133) and infected the 13 negative human melanoma
line, VUP. Puromycin-resistant VUP cells obtained after 10 days in
selection media, were enriched for 13-expression using magnetic
bead sorting employing the anti-133 antibody SZ-21. Cells were
cloned and analysed by flow cytometry and immuno-precipitation to
confirm the cell surface expression of 13. A representative avP33
positive clone (V15) and a representative avp3 negative clone
(V20) were analysed further. Injection of 2xlO V15, V20 or VUP
(parent) cells s.c. or i.v. into athymic nude mice failed to form
tumours over a six months observation period. In contrast, if
comparable cell numbers were coinjected with 200,1 matrigel all
three lines formed rapidly growing tumours (11 days to 5mm
diameter) Similar in vivo growth rates indicated that the matrigel-
enhanced xenograft formation of these lines was independent of
avB3 expression. However, when 2x106 tumour cells were
pretreated with 35,ug of 17E6 (av-blocking) antibody, prior to
coinjection (s.c.) with matrigel, growth of parental VUP and V20
lines was unaffected while growth of the avP3 positive line, V15
was delayed by 3-4 weeks. These data indicate that an (av-blocking)
antibody 17E6 induces a growth retardation of axvP3 positive, but
not avP3 negative cells and suggests that signalling through the 13
subunit may contribute to in vivo tumour cell proliferation.

E-cadherin, a member of a family of transmembrane
glycoproteins which mediate calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion, is
expressed in all epithelia, and plays a role in morphogenesis,
differentiation and maintenance of tissue integrity. E-cadherin has been
implicated in tumour suppression, with loss of E-cadherin function
correlating with dedifferentiation, increased invasiveness and poorer
prognosis in various epithelial cancers. Possible mechanisms for this
effect include loss of adhesiveness (through reduced amounts of E-
cadherin or through a loss of the link to the cytoskeleton) and an
alteration in signalling (possibly through 1-catenin or the EGF receptor
pathway).
As a means of studying the role of E-cadherin in breast cancer,
we have reduced E-cadherin function in the E-cadherin-positive breast
cancer cell line ZR75-1 by the use of a dominant negative mutant. The
construct encodes the extracellular domain of the murine MHC class I
molecule H-2Kd linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions
of mouse E-cadherin (Zhu and Watt, Journal of Cell Science 109, 3013,
1996). The resultant cell line (ZR-E) grew as a monolayer with distinct
refractile edges, while the cell-cell borders in the parental line were not
visible. The H-2Kd domain was detectable by FACS analysis and indirect
immunofluorescence, and a, 1 and y-catenins were immunoprecipitated
with anti-H-2Kd antibody SFI-1.1, confirming the activity of the inserted
mouse E-cadherin cytoplasmic tail.
FACS analysis revealed a two-fold downregulation of
endogenous surface E-cadherin, confirmed by Western blotting. On
indirect immunofluorescence, the residual E-cadherin was largely
extractable with Triton X-100, suggesting a loss of anchorage to the
cytoskeleton. Functional analysis of the ZR-E line compared with
ZR75- 1 showed it to be less cohesive, less motile in wound-healing
assays, and unable to form spheroids. These findings indicate that
abrogation of E-cadherin activity has profound effects on the biological
behaviour of breast cancer cells.

P77 THE USE OF A MURINE MODEL OF FAMILIAL
ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS TO STUDY THE VARIATION IN E-
CADHERIN ANDP-CATENIN EXPRESSION. D.J. Clark*, S.A. Watson,
T.M. Morris and J.H. Scholefield. Academic Unit of Cancer Studies,
Division ofGI Surgery, University ofNottingham UK.
E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, has been widely employed as a marker in a
variety of human tumours' including colorectal cancer. P-catenin, a protein believed
to regulate enterocyte proliferation and apoptosis, binds with E-cadherin as part of
the cadherin-catenin complex which is of importance in cell adhesion. The product
of the tumour suppressor gene, APC, competes with E-cadherin for binding of I-
catenin 2 The expression of both E-cadherin and P-catenin has been shown to be
reduced in colorectal cancer.
A mutant mouse lineage which exhibits inherited predisposition to multiple
intestinal neoplasia (Min) has long been used as a model to study familial
adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Both the Min/+ mouse and patients predisposed to
FAP carry a germline mutation in the Apc gene3.
The aim of this study was to utilise the Min mouse model to compare the level of
expression of both E-cadherin and P-catenin from early through to late stages of
malignancy.
Min/+ mice were terminated at either 4 weeks, 8 weeks or 12 weeks of age and the
large intestine removed. Tumour and surrounding tissue were excised from five
areas along the length of the intestine, formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. The
intestinal mucosal samples were analysed by immunohistochemistry to examine the
expression of both E-cadherin and 0-catenin. Control samples were obtained from
representative areas of the large intestine of both Min/- and C57BI mice terminated
at the same age.
Tissue sections were examined for differences in the expression of E-cadherin and
0-catenin between the normal intestinal mucosa and that of the tumour. Essentially
the level ofexpression ofboth proteins was found to be correlated with the degree of
malignancy when compared to the normal. Membranous versus cytoplasmic staining
of the proteins was found to vary between the samples,with a loss of membranous
staining indicating a reduction in cell adhesion.
This study has enabled some of the early changes which may occur in colorectal
cancer to be identified.

Normal and malignant breast epithelia express and often secrete
mucins, and their cellular upregulation has been reported in breast
tumours. Elevated serum levels post-surgery may reflect the
subclinical development ofmetastatic disease.
The C595 anti-MUC I antibody would not titrate on T47D breast
carcinoma cell lines (median channels 213 to >609, control= 2.1) so
the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line was used having a lower level of
expression of MUC I (Med. Ch 10, contol 2.0). MUC I expression
was upregulated by cytokines (30% increases with G-CSF, GM-CSF,
and IL-I; and 120% increase with IFNy).In contrast, the intercellular
adhesion molecule (ICAM- 1, CD54) was upregulated by both IL-I
(150%) and IFNy (300%).
Association and dissociation studies were undertaken with FITC
conjugated C595 (F:P ratio 6:1) at room temperature over 10-20
minutes. Cells were pre-labelled with unconjugated Ab, then exposed
to excess FITC conjugate, or vice verca, and changes in fluorescence
detected over time (dissociation); or fluorescence measured after
adding FITC C595 alone (association).
The association constant of 5ul (=5ug) FITC Ab was calculated at
9.93x10I0ml/cell.second, with a very rapid binding rate (<30
seconds) and a long offrate (>20 minutes). Conjugated antibody had
a slower dissociation rate than the unconjugated form.
P78 NOVEL UROTHELIAL-SPECIFIC GENE EXPRESSION
IDENTIFIED USING DIFFERENTIAL DISPLAY RT-PCR.

Tissue-specific genes provide information regarding the structure
and/or function of that tissue and may be used as molecular markers of a
particular cellular phenotype. The ability of the associated promoter /
enhancer elements of such genes to direct transgene expression in a tissue
specific manner has been exploited to produce specific cancer models and
direct therapeutic gene expression. Our aim was to identify novel urothelial
specific genes with expression retained following neoplastic transformation.
Differential display RT-PCR was performed with 30 primer
combinations on autologous DNAse treated mRNA from bovine lung,
oesophagus, bladder, liver and spleen. 21 bands derived from cDNA
products suggesting urothelial specific mRNA expression were isolated and
T-A cloned into pGEM vectors. Database homology was assessed for the
33 discrete differential display products identified by sequencing.
Sequences identified included uroplakins la and 11, two of the three genes
previously known to have urothelial specific expression. 19 of the
sequences had no homology with sequences on the GenBank database.
Ribonuclease protection assays were performed to confirm the
tissue specificity of a number of the cloned products. Three of the seven
novel sequences tested were confirmed to exhibit urothelial-specific
expression.
A bovine urothelial cDNA library was screened using riboprobes
generated from the differential display products. Four discrete clones
ranging between 700 and 1650 bp were isolated for one of these
sequences. More than 1000 bases of additional coding region sequence
was obtained by PCR of the cDNA library using vector and sequence
specific primers. RT-PCR of both coding region and 3' UTR confirmed the
urothelial specificity of the gene.
Analysis of the assembled sequence identified significant homology
within the coding region to previously described urea transporters, a family
of proteins responsible for the active transport of urea across plasma
membranes. This suggests the identification of a novel gene which acts as
a urea transporter within the urothelium of the urinary tract.
P80 PRODUCTION OF A RECOMBINANT ANTI-
MUC1 MUCIN DIABODY. Graeme Denton*,
Kevin Brady, Andrea Murray and Michael R. Price. Cancer Research
Laboratory, School of Pharm. Sci., Univ. of Nottm., NG7 2RD. UK.
MUCI mucins are highly glycosylated glycoproteins expressed
on the lumenal surfaces of glandular epithelia. Apart from their major
physiological functions as protective agents and biological lubricants,
they are frequently elevated and/or altered in cancer and thus have
potential as tumour markers.
The present investigation was initiated to produce derivatives of
anti-MUCI mucin antibodies which would have the potential for use in
tumour targeting. Here we describe the production of a recombinant
diabody fragment incorporating the variable region of the anti-MUCl
mucin monoclonal antibody C595, using a bacterial expression system
used to produce C595 scFv'. The shortened linker method was
employed to alter the C595 scFv linker sequence between VH and VL
from (Gly4Ser)3 to Gly6Ser. This was achieved using a four primer
PCR system. The Gly6Ser linker sequence in the expressed protein no
longer allows intramolecular pairing of the VH and VL domains of the
scFv as highlighted by modelling studies. These domains then pair with
complementary domains on neighbouring molecules, to form a bivalent
monospecific scFv dimer (diabody).
Detailed analyses of the binding characteristics of the C595
diabody show these to be similar to those of the parental monoclonal.
Its ability to bind to MUC1 expressing tumours and cell lines identifies
it as a potential targeting reagent so that development of diagnostic and
therapeutic applications are appropriate.

P81 ERRB-2 MEDIATES THE EFFECTS OF HEREGULIN
ON CELL MOTILITY BUT NOT PROLIFERATION OF
T-47D CELLS, Carol Sawyer and Christopher Dean*, The Institute of Cancer
Research, McElwain Laboratories, Sutton, Surrey, UK
Over-expression ofthe receptor for EGF (EGFR) and the related product of the
c-erbB-2 proto-oncogene (pl85&2) have been found to be indicators of poor
prognosis in patients with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. While
a nunber ofgrowth factors have been described which bind to and activate the
EGFR none has been found as yet which binds directly to pl 85-. Recently.
a series ofgrowsth factors collectively called the neuregulins and including the
heregulns, glial growth factors, ARIA and neu differentiating factor, have been
described which have been found to bind to two other members of the EGF
receptor family namely erbB-3 (which lacks endogenous kinase activity) and
erbB-4 but not to the EGFR or erbB-2. However, the binding ofthese growth
factors can be followed by activation not only of the receptors dtemselves but
also ofthe EGFR and pl852. It is becoming incringly clear that cross-talk
between the different members of the EGFR family, possibly as a result of
hetero-dimerisation, is important in determining signal transduction via these
receptors. We have been investigating the role of the EGF receptor family in
tranmittng the biological effects of one of the neuregulins, namely, heregulin-
PI and have used a series ofrat monoclonal antibodies directed against different
epitopes on the extracellular domain of pl85' to investigate the role ofthis
receptor in signal transduction. Our results show that while heregulin activates
both erbB-2 and erbB-3 and stimulaies the proliferation ofthe breast cancer cell
line T-47D, it also acts to restrict cell migration. One of the antibodies to
plg850 (ICR 2) inhibits the high affinitv binding of '14heregulin-f3I to T47D
cells and prevents the activation of this receptor as judged by receptor
phosphorylation. As a consequence. co-tement with heregulin-4I and ICR12
reverses the effect ofthis growth factor on cell motility and/or adhesion but does
not prevent the ligand-induced stimulation of proliferation of the cells. We
conclude that in T47D cells signalling via erbB-2 is important for the control of
cell migration.

Neoplastic btasformation is assocted wih dysregulabtion of
epitheil cytodifferentiation. In the uroepithelium of the urinary tac,teram inal
cytodifferentation is acterised by the acquisition of a unique apical
asymmetric unit mentm e and expression of urofthelium-specific antgens.
NHU cells prnpagated in vitro in serum-free mnedium have a proife
basl/intermediate phenotYpe, but do not express uneia differentiation
antigens. We have i ted he effects of culturing NHU cells on
Matrgel, which has been shown to induce differentiation in ofter epithelial
cel systems.
NHUcells were maintaied for 3 -7 days on Primaria plastic dishes
or on gels composed of Matrige, in te presence or absence of cytokines or
blocking antibodies. Cells were dissocite from matrices using codagenase
and dispase. Phenotype wasdetermined by indirect immunofluorescence.
NHU cells on Matigel demor de novo expression of the
uroftell d _ _ d antigens, UMA and AUM, in respectively
12/13 and 21/23 cell nes from independent donors. A less marked
inducton wasnoted when NHU cels were plated on colagen matrices. On
Maigel, induction of difrntiaton antgen expression was blocked by
eiter a TGF3 neutrsg anibody or a 1l-inegmn functonal actvator
antibody, whereas the inducbon of differentaton was unaffected by a
neutaisi 1-integrin antibody. Neither TGFi nor the 31-integrin
neutaisingor activating antibodies aone were able to induce differentiation
of NHU cells grown on Prinaria dishes.
These data suggest that inducton of urothelial differenaon at a

an appropriate exbtacellular matrix.

Urothlnium, Fe precursor for traitional cell (TCC), is a
slow tumover eptheium with high p potenia during regeneration
or in monolayer culu in vitro (Soutate et a/ Lab Invest 1994: 71: 583).
However, the mechanisms inolved in regulating normal human urothlal
(NHU) cell proa are unclear.
Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry and showed
that freshly isoated NHU celf were arrested in GO/Gi. By contrast, NHU
cells in culture were distribued in G1-S-G2 phases and arrested in GI at
confluence. Profierabon of NHU cells in vitro was monitored by growth
curves and triiated thymidmne incrporation. NHU cels in culture showed a
high pferation rate with an esIad population doubling tme of 15h.
NHU cels were not responsive to exogenous EGF and retained a high
proiferatn rate even when cultured in serum-free media with no
exogenous growth factors.
Condioned medium from NHU cels was mitogenic for mouse
NIH3T3 fibrobasts, suggestng secreton of autocrne/paracrne growth
factor(s). Furthermore, NHU cel pferaon was wholly inhibited by
antagonistic anti-EGFR anbbodies. Incomp growth inhibiton could be
observed with neutrasg antbodies to the EGFR-igand Amphireguhn and
NHU cels expressed mRNA for Amphireguhn by RT-PCR.
These data suggest tat a major component of growth regulabtion of
NHUC invohes autoc*ne growth factors of the EGF famiy. This finding has

P84 TGF-4 DOWNREGULATES IMMUNE RESPONSES
AND PROMOTES TUMOUR CELL MIGRATION
Toomey, D., Harmey, J., Bouchier-Hayes, D. Dept. Surgical Research,
Beaumont Hospital and R.C.S.I.
Tumour expansion is regulated by the balance of positive and negative
growth factors in the tumour envionment Tumour growth factors include
angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF, PDGF and TGF41. Some tumour
promoting agents also have immunosuppressive properties, thus
promoting tumour growth both directly and indirectly. We have
previously shown that breast tumours produce large amounts of TGF-
01. This study examines the effects of TGF-f 1 on leucocyte anti-tumour
function and on tumour cell migration through endothelium.
Lymphocyte anti-tumour cytotoxicty was assessed against the
metastatic breast carcinoma cell line, MDA-MB-231, following
lymphocyte activation with rhIL-2 (1000 U/nil) and 24 hour incubation
with TGF-J (0-5.0 nglml). When IL-2 activated lymphocytes were
incubated with TGF41 (1-5 ng/ml), cytotoxicity was reduced to negligible
levels (p<0.05 control vs treated groups). Macrophage effector function
was mined by investigating spontaneous nitric oxide (NO) and TNF-
a production following 24 hour incubation with TGF-01 (0-7.5 ng/ml).
Macrophage function was examined under both normoxic and hypoxic
growth conditions, such as those found within solid tumours. The
addition of TGF4i (2.5-5.0 ng/ml) to macrophage cultures under hypoxic
conditions significantly decreased macrophage production of both NO and
TNF-a (p<0.05 control vs treated groups). Transendothelial tumour cell
migration was assessed following 4 hour incubation with TGF- I.
Intermediate doses of TGF-01 (2.5 -5.0 ng/ml) resulted in increased
tumour cell migration (p<0.05 control vs treated groups).
TGF4l is a pro-angiogenic cytokine; we have also shown that TGF-
I1 may play a role in the metastatic process by promoting tumour cell
migration. The immunoregulatory properties of TGF-P1 are such that
macrophage and lymphocyte anti-tumour function is suppressed. In
conclusion, TGF-1 production in the tumour environment affects both
immune function and the metastatic process and may explain the
observed failure of IL-2 therapy for breast cancer.

P85 CELL ADHESION MOLECULES AND NM23H1: RELATIONSHIP
TO TGF-BETA IN BREAST CANCER, Al Ibrahim*, J Lawry
and JA Royds, Institute for Cancer Studies, Sheffield University Medical
School, Beech Hill Road, Sheffield, S10 2RX
A link has been seen between nm23H1, a putative metastasis suppressor
gene and TGFf1, a cytokine generally growth inhibitory to epithelial cells. An
altered response to TGFP1 has been observed in soft agar colonisation assays.
nm23H1 transfectants having a reduced response to the cytokine when compared
to their corresponding controls [1]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that there
are two separate TGFf1 pathways. One involves nm23H1 and functions in cells
of lower metastatic potential, where cells show a growth arrest response to
TGF 1. The second TGFP1 pathway functions in cells which have progressed to a
more metastatic phenotype, not involving nm23H1, and results in an increased
invasive, motile and proliferative response to the cytokine [2].
We have used flow cytometry to investigate the link between nm23H1
and TGFf 1 by the analysis of proteins expressed in the cell which may be
important in the metastatic cascade. Six breast cancer cell lines were used, the
rarely metastatic MCF7 and T47D and the highly metastatic MDAMB435 and its
transfectants K27, (vector-only control), H1177 and P57 (high and medium-high
expressors of nm23H1 protein, respectively).
Cell surface ICAM-1 was not expressed at a detectable level in the T47D
and MCF7 lines. In contrast MDAMB435 and all transfectants had increased
levels. this being slightly up-regulated (up to 20%) after TGFfI1 treatment. No
difference in ICAM-1 was observed due to nm23H1 transfection No significant
changes were observed in TGFB1 Receptor expression, however Receptor II was
down-regulated by up to 25% in response to TGFP1 treatment in all cell lines
tested, except the highly over-expressing H1177, which in contrast, showed an up-
regulation of approximately 60% in comparison to its untreated control. Nm23H1
levels in T47D, MCF7 and the MDAMB435 line were reduced by TGF31 treatment
in the ranges of 40%, 25% and 20%, respectively. E-cadherin was not detectable
in the MDAMB435 and transfectant lines, but was expressed at higher levels in the
T47D and MCF7 lines. All cell lines tested negative for a2fli integrin. TGF1-
induced growth inhibition was displayed in all lines except T47D, where no
significant response was observed.
Our results indicate that responses to TGFB1 via nm23H1 may function
by differential expression of TGF31 Receptor II. Cytokine modulated expression of
nm23H1 and various cell adhesion molecules may be a few of many contributing
factors involved in the complex process of metastasis.

We have recently demonstrated the existence of the L-argminie-nitnic oxide
pathway and presence of both endothelial (eNOS) and inducible (iNOS) nitric
oxide synthases in the ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cell line. We have also
shown that expression of eNOS is inversely correlated to histologic grade in
primary invasive ductal breast carcinomas. The aim of the present study was
to investigate possible effects of estrogen independence on NOS expression
using a variant of the ZR-75-1 cell line (ZR-PR-LT) which has acquired
estrogen independence.
Immunohistochemical studies used the primary antibodies, bovine anti-
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (599-613) and mouse macrophage anti-
inducible nitric oxide synthase (I13 1-1144). NO2- concentration in
conditioned medium was quantitated by the Greiss reaction.
The percentage of cells staining positive for eNOS and iNOS is shown in the
table below. ZR-PR-LT exhibited much fewer positively staining cells
compared to the parent cell line.
%o Positive cells (eNOS) % Positive cells (iNOS)
ZR-75-1 100 52
ZR-PR-LT <5 0
ZR-PR-LT cells therefore secreted significantly lower (p<0.001) levels of
nitrite into the conditioned medium compared to ZR-75- 1 cells
We have investigated the effects of various drugs on nitrite secretion by the
ZR-PR-LT cell line. Neither phorbol 12-mynistate 13-acetate (200-10OOnM)
nor tamoxifen (I 0-9M-10-M) had a significant effect on nitrite production.
whereas progesterone (10 'oM-106M) significantly (p<005) reduced nitrite
secretion
In conclusion, our results show that estrogen independence in human breast
cancer cells is associated with reduced NOS expression and support the
suggestion that lack of NOS expression may be related to the degree of
malignancy in human breast cancer.

Phenylacetate (PA) is a nontoxic cell differentiation inducer, which
has been shown to reduce the invasiveness of prostate cancer cells in
in vitro assays (Samid D, et al. J Clin Invest. 91: 2288-2295, 1992)
and is currently in phase I trials for solid tumors (Thibault A, et al.
Cancer Res 54: 1690-1694, 1994). In our experiments with prostate
cancer cell lines PA in low concentrations (0.25 - lmM) stimulated
cell proliferation as measured by MTT assays and pretreated DU-145
and PC3 cells (4 day PA exposure) show increased sensitivity to
camptothecin (CPT) and doxorubicin (35 - 45% sensitization). This
effects were found in cells attached to substrate, but not for suspension
cultures, which exhibit reduced growth and higher resistance to CPT
and doxorubicin. In low-density cell cultures PA increased the S-
traction bv 45% within 4 davs as measured by propidiumn iodide
staining and flow cytometry cell cycle analysis. The fraction of
apoptotic cells in PA-pretreated cultures exposed to CPT and
doxorubicin as detected by annexinV-bindincg assays and sub-GI-
peaks in cell cycle analysis was significantly increased. In
spectrotluorimetric measurements of intracellular pH (pHi) using
BCECF-stained adenocarcinomia cell lines (colon, breast, prostate) in
HEPES or bicarbonate buffer the cells exhibit a reversible Na+-
dependent decrease of 0.1 - 0.2 pH units in response to 0.25 - 0.5 mM
PA and this decrease in pH, is also observable under acidic
extracellUlar conditions preva'ilinig in tumnors. According to these
results PA not only reduces thetmetastatic potential of carcinoma
cells. but ill addition sensitizes in low concentrations the tumor cells to
cvtotoxic drubs Such as doxorubicini and CPT and lowers intracellular
pH. s hich stabilizes the active lactone form of camptothecines.

Solid tumors must stimulate the growth a blood supply if they are to grow to a
volume greater than 1mm3. This process known as tumour-induced angiogenesis occurs
rapidly under the influence of factors released by the tumour cells'. These vessels differ
markedly from normal tissue microvasculture, being rapidly proliferating, tortous, thin
walled, chaotically arranged, maximally dilated and respond poorly to vasoactive agents2.
Another feature of tumour capillaries is the loss of contact between pericytes and endothelial
cells and a reduced extension of pericyte processes3. In normal capillaries, pericytes exist in
close association with the underlying endothelium either making direct contact with it via
numerous processes or separated from it by basal lamina. One of the many proposed
functions of pericytes is the control of endothelial cell growth and microvessel tone.
Pericytes have been shown to inhibit the growth of endothelial cells in vitro and to have an
effect on capillary blood flow. They have been shown to contract in response to endothelin
and relax in response to nitric oxide, both potent vasoactive agents4. It is our hypothesis,
therefore, that reduced pericyte/endothelial cell contacts or reduced pericyte numbers are
important factors in the lack of regulation of endothelial cell growth and microvessel tone at
the site of a tumour. Pericytes may, therefore, regulate the expression of vasoactive or
growth related genes in endothelial cells.
We have examined the effects of media conditioned by a human colon carcinoma
cell line HT-29 (TCM) or bovine retinal microvascular pericytes (PCM) on gene expression
in the human microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1. We have found that after a 6hr
exposure to TCM, HMEC-I showed a five fold increase in the levels of expression of
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein. No significant change was
observed in the levels of constituitive NOS (cNOS) mRNA or protein. In comparison, after
3hrs exposure to PCM, HMEC-1 showed a five fold decrease in expression of iNOS mRNA
and protein. Again no significant change was observed in the levels of cNOS expression.
After 5hrs exposure to PCM, HMEC-1 exhibited a three fold increase in the levels of mRNA
for endothelin-l. Using the technique of differential mRNA display, we have shown that
there are many clear differences in gene expression in HMEC-I after six hours exposure to
PCM. A total of eight candidate genes have now been cloned, sequenced and where possible
identified. It is apparent that most of these genes have a role to play in blood vessel
development. The identification of candidate genes involved in blood vessel growth and
regulation could yield new targets for therapeutic intervention to restrict neovascularization
or control tumour blood flow.

Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen which
promotes growth and angiogenesis. It has been shown in model systems that in vivo
administration of anti-VEGF antibodies1 or blockade of the VEGF receptor on endothelial
cells2 inhibits tumour angiogenesis and consequently tumour growth. VEGF is thus a strong
candidate for anti-angiogenic cancer therapy.
Anti-VEGF antibodies were produced using filamentous phage technology as previously
described3. Phage expressing single chain Fv (scFv) were subjected to 4 rounds of panning on
VEGF coated tubes to isolate those reactive with VEGF. Five of these were selected for further
analysis on the basis of their DNA sequence diversity, intensity of signal in VEGF binding
ELISA and by immunohistochemistry to assess reactivity with blood vessel endothelium.
The selected scFv were subcloned into an expression plasmid incorporating a His6 tag. scFv
proteins were purified from culture supernatants by metal chelate chromatography with yields
ranging from 6 to 60mg/L. Purified scFV were biotinylated and used in immunohistochemical
studies to examine binding to human placenta, normal human colon, human colorectal
carcinoma and human colorectal xenografts (LS174T; SW1 16; SW122).
Three of the five scFv clones tested did not show significant reactivity with any of the tissue
sections tested. A further clone showed weak staining for placental trophoblast and blood
vessel endothelium and weak binding to stromal cells in the other tissue sections but did not
show any specificity for blood vessels in human tumours or human tumour xenografts. scFv
clone L4.6 however reacted with both blood vessels endothelium and syncitial cells in term
placenta and was positive for both blood vessel endothelium and stromal cells in colorectal
carcinoma and human xenograft tissue. Reactivity with the epithelium of the human carcinoma
and with the xenograft tumour cells was heterogeneous. Blood vessels in normal colon were
also positive.
scFv clone L4.6 targets blood vessels in human tumours and human tumour xenogratts and
therefore merits further study as a vehicle for antibody-directed delivery of agents to tumour
tissues in both animal models and as a model for potential use in patients.

Angiogenesis is essential for tumour growth beyond I to 2 mm in
diameter and plays a key role in the metastatic spread of cancer. Vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a cytokine involved in tumour
angiogenesis. Human cells express 4 different VEGF molecules of 121, 165,
189 and 206 aninoacids which are all encoded by a gene located on
chromosome 6p21.3. Employing the VG1 antibody, which recognises
epitopes on the 121, 165 and 189 VEGF molecules, and the streptavidin-
biotin immunohistochemistry technique we evaluated tissue sections of
tumour samples from 144 patients with lung cancer for the expression of
VEGF. VEGF expression was correlated with T-stage, N-stage, histological
subtype and grade, proliferation index and microvessel density, and nuclear
and wild type cytoplasmic/perinuclear p53, bcl-2, EGFR and c-erbB-2
oncoprotein expression. Strong VEGF immunoreactivity in >50% oftumour
cells was seen in 65/120 (54%) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples.
No expression was detected in small cell lung cancer. High vascular grade
tumours had significantly more VEGF immunoreactive cells than low
vascular grade tumours, the association being significant for squamous cell
tumours only (p=0.0002). No association was found between p53 expression
and vascular grade or prognosis. However linear regression analysis showed
a significant inverse correlation between VEGF and cytoplasmic/perinuclear
p53 expression (p=0.003; r=0.26). Also subset analysis revealed microvessel
counts to be significantly higher in cases with positive VEGF expression and
absent cytoplasmic/perinuclear p53 staining vs VEGF negative,
cytoplasmic/perinuclear p53 positive (p=0.03) or VEGF negative,
cytoplasmic/perinuclear p53 negative cases (p=0.007). High VEGF
expression was associated with a poor prognosis in NO disease (p=0.03). No
association was found between VEGF expression and the other tumouir
parameters studied. In conclusion the results indicate that VEGF expression
in NSCLC is associated with angiogenesis, loss of wild type
cytoplasmic/perinuclear p53 immunoreactivity and a worse prognosis.
P92 INTRODUCTION OF ENDOTOXIN DURINGSURGERY INCREASES METASTATIC TUMOUR

Beaumont Hospital, Royal College of Surgeons Ireland, Dublin 9, Ireland.
Introduction: The surgical resection of primary tumours may
paradoxically induce rapid metastatic growth, resulting in post-operative
tumour recurrence. We hypothesised that endotoxin (LPS) introduced at
the time of surgery contributes to increased growth of metastases by
inducing tumour cell proliferation and stimulating production of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor.
Methods: 50 Balb/c mice were injected with 105 4T1 mammary
adenocarcinoma cells by tail-vein injection. On dayl4 the animals
received either anaesthetic alone, laparoscopy under CO2 to exclude air,
laparoscopy with air, mid-line laparotomy (open surgery), saline
injection or LPS injection (10,ug). Lungs were excised on dayl9 and
weighed as an index of metastatic burden. Mitotic indices within
metastases were examined by histology with H&E staining and tumour
cell apoptosis by TUNEL staining. Plasma LPS levels following surgery
was examined by the LAL assay and serum VEGF by ELISA. Results:
A significantly higher metastatic burden was observed in both the
laparotomy and air laparoscopy groups compared to either control or
CO2 laparoscopy groups (p<0.02). No significant difference was
observed between controls and CO2 laparoscopy groups. Metastatic
burden was also significantly higher in the endotoxin injection group
compared to saline controls (p<0.001). Increased metastatic burdens
coincided with significantly increased mitotic indices within lung
metastases (p<0.05) in the surgical and injection groups. Both plasma
LPS and serum VEGF levels were significantly elevated following open
surgery or laparoscopy with air (p<0.05) and a significant positive
correlation was observed when LPS and VEGF was examined in all
groups (r=0.99). Conclusion: Our results show that open surgery
and/or endotoxin increase tumour cell growth, metastasis and circulating
VEGF. Reducing surgical exposure to LPS may attenuate post-operative
metastatic tumour growth.

Introduction: Interleukin-6(IL-6) is a proinflammmatory cytokine
secreted by monocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and a
number of tumour cell lines. We have previously shown IL-6 is
significantly higher in breast tumour tissue and serum of breast
cancer patients compared to normal controls. To determine the
role of IL-6 within the breast tumour microenviroment we
investigated the effect of IL-6 treatment on proliferation and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. of MDA-
MB231 cells, an estrogen receptor negative metastatic tumour cell
line,
Methods: MDA-MB231 cells were plated at 5 x105 cells/ml, and
allowed to adhere for 24 hours. Cells were then treated with 0
1000 pg/ml IL-6 for 24 hours and proliferation rates determined
using the Cell Titre proliferation assay. To determine the effect of
IL-6 on angiogenic factor production, MDA-MB231 cells were
plated at 2 x 106 cells /ml, and allowed to adhere for 24 hours.
Cells were treated with 500 pg/ml IL-6 for 24 hours.
Supernatants were assayed for VEGF using ELISA, and cell
lysates assayed for protein using the B.C.A. assay.
Results: IL-6 treatment of MDA-MB231 cells increased
proliferation in a dose dependent manner. (r = 0.831, Pearson
Product Moment). VEGF production by MDA-MB231 cells is
significantly upregulated following treatment with IL-6 for 24
hours (p< 0.02).
Conclusions:Interleukin-6 increases both tumour cell proliferation
and vascular endothelial cell growth factor production in breast
cancer.

ENDOTHELIN B RECEPTOR AGONIST IRL 1620:

Endothelin-l (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor produced by endothelial
cells, which acts via two groups of receptors namely ETA and ETB receptors. In the
vasculature, ETB receptors reside on both the smooth muscle cells, which produces
vasoconstriction, and the endothelial cells, which causes vasodilation. The result of
the balance between the constrictive and dilator responses to ETB receptor ligands is
dependent on the complement of receptor subtypes within the tissue. Tumours are
unresponsive to many vasoactive agents, therefore we compared the response of the
rat HSN tumour with that in normal rat tissues, to the selective endothelin B (ETB)
receptor agonist, IRL 1620 ([Suc-(Glu9, Ala" 5)-ET-_ (8-21)]).
IRL 1620 was administered to anaesthetised rats by bolus i.v. injection at a
dose of 1, 3 or5nmol kg-'. Blood flow in the tumour and normal tissues was measured
20 min later, by the uptake of 25I iodoantipyrine (125I-IAP). Blood flow in the tumour
decreased dose dependently to 0.4 of the control blood flow, in contrast to the
majority of tissues in which blood flow was unchanged. The exceptions to this were
the brain and heart in which blood flow increased by a factor of 1.2-1.5 at all doses,
and the small intestine in which blood flow was also reduced to 0.5 of the control
value, at all doses tested.
Changes in the spatial distribution of tumour blood flow were examined in a
group of rats treated with 3nmol kg-' IRL 1620 (bolus i.v.), compared to that in saline
treated animals. Blood flow was measured by the uptake of "C-IAP and spatial
distribution of blood flow measured by autoradiography. Blood flow in the tumour
periphery was higher than that in the central region of the tumour (0.76±0.10 versus
0.49±0.09 ml g' -min"'). In rats treated with IRL 1620 however, a reduction in blood
flow to approximately 0.4 of control blood flow was observed in both the peripheral
and central regions of the tumour.
Results illustrate that the HSN tumour responds relatively selectively to the
ETB receptor agonist, IRL 1620, and that vessels throughout the tumour are uniformly
responsive. Such a finding may be exploitable in cancer therapies which are enhanced
under ischaemic conditions, such as the use of bioreductive drugs.

P94 THE ROLE OF PDGF IN TUMOUR CELL-DERIVED
FACTOR STIMULATION OF FIBROBLAST GLYCOSAMINOGLYCAN
SYNTHESIS, J.L. Godden, M. Edward* and R.M. MacKie, Department of
Dermatology, The Robertson Building, University of Glasgow, GlasgowG128QQ,
Many tumours are surrounded by a hyaluronan-rich matrix which is thoughtt
facilitate tumour growth, angiogenesis and invasion. The majority of this hyalurorka,
appears to be synthesised by normal fibroblasts stimulated to do so by tumourtell
derived factors. We have previously shown that conditioned medium (CM) fromn tw
human melanoma cell lines (C8161 & Hs294T) contains potent fibrobl
glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-stimulating factors. Amicon ultrafiltration of thetunln.,
CM suggests that full activity is dependent upon synergy between a factor present in a
fraction >lkDa and a factor <lkDa, with the individual fractions exhibiting mininwactivity.
The >lkDa fraction exhibits a degree of binding to heparin-Sepharose andpariaheat and trypsin sensitivity. In view of these observations, a number of growth facts
were examined for their activity as stimulators of GAG synthesis. In isolation noneof
the tested factors includingbFGF, IL-I3, pleiotrophin, PDGF, TGF-3, TNF-cz and
VEGF displayed any significant GAG-stimulating activity, but when tested in the
presence of the <lkDa fraction, bFGF and PDGF were both found to stimulate GAG
synthesis. The presence of PDGF and bFGF in the melanoma cell CM was verified
usingcommercial ELISA kits.Hs294T cell CM contained1.7ng/ml PDGF-ABand
160pg/ml bFGF and C8161 cell CM 1.6ng/ml PDGF-AB and12pg/ml bFGp.
Neutralising antibodies to bFGF and PDGF added to the melanoma cell CM
decreased the fibroblast GAG-stimulating activity in both cases.
As PDGF stimulated the greatest increase in fibroblast GAG synthesis, we
examined fibroblast phosphotyrosine response to PDGF and melanoma cell CM.Tee
activity of PDGF-AA and PDGF-BB isoforms was found to be indistinguishable,
suggesting the PDGF-a receptor plays a role in the GAG stimulatory response since
the PDGF-0 receptor will bind only to the PDGF-BB isoform of the growth factor.
Western analysis after treatment with PDGF, bFGF or melanoma cell CM revealed
banding patterns for PDGF and melanoma cell CM that were similar.
Immunoprecipitation of PDGF receptorac revealed it to be phosphorylated in
fibroblast cells treated with PDGF at lOng/ml and melanoma cell CM, but cells
treated with control fibroblast CM showed no PDGF receptorat phosphorylation.-
These studies suggest that PDGF plays an important role in the GAG-stimulating
activity of the CM by synergising with the low molecular weight fraction (<lkDa).

Thetubulin-binding agent, combretastatin A4 and its more soluble derivative,
combretastatin A4-P (CA4-P), have potential as tumour vascular targeting agents.
CA4-P caused vascular collapse in murine and human tumours growing in mice at
non-toxic doses (Dark et al., 1997, Cancer Research, 57, 1829). In the present
study, the vascular effects of CA4-P were investigated in more detail in rats bearing
the P22 rat carcinosarcoma. Blood flow to s.c. tumours and normal tissues was
measured using the uptakeof '25-labelled iodo-antipyrine ('25-IAP). Rats bearing the
P22 tumour growing in transparent window chambers implanted into the dorsal skin
were used to measure tumour vascular parameters at the single vessel level.
Tumour blood flow was reduced to 12% and 0.9% of control levels at Ih and
6h respectively following 100 mg -
kg' CA4-P i.p.. Significant but smaller
reductions in blood flow were also observed in normal skin, skeletal muscle and
spleen at 1 h. No significant reductions were found for brain, heart, kidney and small
intestine at I h. At 6h, blood flow to the brain had decreased to 80% of control levels
with no significant change in heart, kidney and small intestine.
The gross tumour vascular changes induced by 100 mg* kg-' CA4-P i.p. were
characterised by irregular / intermittent flow, sludging of red cells and, finally,
stasis. At 10 minutes following drug administration, 35% of venules/capillaries in
central tumour areas were static. At 75-100 minutes, 70% of venules / capillaries
were static. Early changes included a decrease in red cell velocity to 40% of control
at 2 minutes and a decrease in vascular diameter to 60% of control at 10 minutes
after drug administration, in tumour arterioles. Infusion of Hoechst 33342 into the
systemic circulation of a subset of animals highlighted a population of
endothelialised venules and a population of venules devoid of endothelial cells.
Preliminary studies have shown that the endothelialised vessels were more resistant
to CA4-P than the non-endothelialised vessels.
In summary, lAP uptake studies showed that the vascular effects ofCA4-P were
more profound in tumours than in any of the normal tissues studied. However,
significant blood flow changes were observed in normal tissues, highlighting the
need for further toxicity studies The window chamber studies suggest that the
mechanism ofaction ofCA4-P may involve vasoactive effects and blood coagulation
which is influenced by local factors such as theaction of endothelial cells. CA4-P is
a promising vascular targeting agent which requires further study in order to
determine its mechanism ofaction and selectivity for tumour tissue.

Angiogenesis is essential for the growth and metastatic spread of
solid tumours. Recent work has demonstrated that angiogenesis increases
with histological grade of CIN, the precursor to SCC. VEGF and PD-ECGF
are angiogenic growth factors for a number of solid tumnours including lung,
bladder and colorectal carcinoma. Expression of bcl-2, an inhibitor of
apoptosisis, is associated with a favourable outcome in solid tumours and
inversely correlates with vascular grade in squamous cell lung cancer. We
evaluated VEGF, PD-ECGF and bcl-2 expression and microvessel density
(MVD) in paraffin-embedded tissue sections of normal cervix, CIN and SCC
from 60 patients using immunohistochemistry. MVD was calculated by
counting the number of von Willibrand's factor (vWf) positive vessels per
unit area subtending normal and abnormal epithelium. Expression of VEGF,
PD-ECGF and bcl-2 was assessed visually and scored from 0 - 3. A
significant progressive increase in MVD from a mean of 30 for normal tissue
to 56 for invasive tissue was seen (p=0.0001). The expression of VEGF
(p=0.004) and PD-ECGF (p=0.05) likewise increased from normal cervical
tissue through to malignant disease. There was a progressive loss of bcl-2
expression, the highest expression being seen in normal tissue and the lowest
in SCC (p=0.05). In conclusion, a progressive increase in MVD, and VEGF
and PD-ECGF expression, is seen as the cervix takes on a malignant
phenotype indicating an important role for angiogenesis and angiogenic
growth factors in the pathogenesis of SCC. The development of anti-
angiogenic agents and VEGF antagonists, and the recognition that PD-ECGF
is thymidine phosphorylase, a key enzyme in the activation of
fluoropyrimidine cytotoxic agents suggests that the immunohistochemical
evaluation of MVD, VEGF and PD-ECGF should be taken into account in
designing chemotherapeutic studies in cervical cancer.

The abl oncogenes, encoding abl protein tyrosilne kinases, inhibit
apoptosis without affecting cell proliferation. AbN is ubiquitously
expressed in most mammalian tissues, but intense staining is observed
in certain cell types such as chondrocytes and adipocytes.
The aim of this study was to investigate AbN expression in
angiogenesis during enchondral ossification and in lumour
angiogenesis. Sections from 24 paraffin blocks of fetal rib (16-42wks
gestation), 8 signet ring carcinomas of stomach, 8 liposarcoinas and 10
breast carcinomas were stained immunohistocheinically for the c-
Abl/BCR-Abl oncoprotein (Serotec, UK), using appropriate controls.
Abl immunoreactivity was not seen in normal blood vessels in
adult tissues. In the fetus, there was striking Abl immunoreactivity in
osteoblasts and their associated neovasculature in sites of encliondral
ossification from 17 weeks. In signet ring carcinoma, breast carcinoma
and liposarcoma moderate to intense Abl expression was observed, to
a variable extent, in angiogenic tumour microvessels as well as in
tumour cells. These findings highlight a previously unidentified role1r1
the c-abl oncogene in angiogenesis. The validity of these observations
is currently being demonstrated at themRNA level using RT-PCR and

Abl kinases encoded by the abl oncogenes play an important role in cell
cycle regulation and inhibition of apoptosis. Our previous
immunohistochemical study demonstrated that the Abl protein is weakly
or focally expressed in many different normal tissues, and that certain
cell types (chondrocytes and adipocytes) showed consistent strong
staining. In this study, we extended our observations onl Abl expression
to a series of liposarcomas. Sections from 28 parallfin blocks of'
liposarcoma (round cell, myxoid, mixed type and well differentiated)
were stained immunohistochemically for the c-AbVIBCR-Abl
oncoprotein (Serotec, UK), using appropriate controls.
Expression of the Abl oncoprotein was primarily related to
tumour cell differentiation. The mature adipocytes of' the well
differentiated tumours demonstrated strong Abl expression, hut round
cells and preadipocytes of round cell and myxoid liposarcomnas were
negative. The angiogenic tumour microvessels showed variable Abl
staining, most marked in myxoid liposarcotnas.
These findings strongly support our previously reported role for the c-
abl oncogene in angiogenesis in addition to playing an important'role in
tumour differentiation. In on-going studies we are confirming the
validity of these observations by determining expression of c-abl mRNA
using RT-PCR and IS-RT-PCR.

Aims: Cerebellar haemangioblastoma is a tumour characterized by
proliferation of both endothelial and stromal cells. Recent evidence
demonstrating that loss of heterozygosity of the VHL gene was restricted to
the stromal cells of sporadic haemangioblastomas suggests that the stromal
element is neoplastic and that the vascular proliferation is reactive and non-
neoplastic'. The exact histogenesis of these tumours, however is uncertain.
The aim of this study was to further investigate the origin of the vascular
component using Glucose transporter proteinl(GLUT-l), a component of the
blood-brain barrier which is used as a marker for the endothelium of cerebral
microvasculature.
Methods: Using an antibody which recognizes GLUT-1, we stained paraffin
sections from 5 cases of cerebellar haemangioblastoma. Staining of the
vascular component was assessed by examining 20 high power fields from
each case. Areas with adjacent normal brain tissue were included as a positive
internal control.
Results: We found that at least 80% of the vascular component in each case
did not stain for GLUT-I. The vasculature of the adjacent normal brain tissue
showed strong positive staining in all 5 cases.
Conclusions: We conclude that most endothelial cells of cerebellar
haemangioblastomas do not express GLUT-1. It is likely therefore that they do
not originate from the brain and may in fact be derived from extra-cerebral
microvasculature. most likely dura. This finding has significant implications
for the histogenesis of these rare tumours.

Introduction: New vessel formation is essential for tumour progression and for
metastasis '. There is evidence to suggest that oestrogen plays a role in the
preservation of endothelial cells by the inhibition of apoptosis 2. The aim of this study
is to determine whether treatment of primary breast cancers with neoadjuvant tamoxifen
is associated with a change in tumour vascularity.
Methods: Thirty one postmenopausal women with large (>3cm), oestrogen receptor
positive (>20fmol/mg cytosolic protein) primary breast carcinomas were treated with a
three month course of tamoxifen, 20mg daily, prior to surgery and following an initial
wedge biopsy. Response to tamoxifen was assessed by serial monthly ultrasound of the
primary tumour and was defined as >25% reduction in tumour volume with no evidence
of progression in the final ultrasound assessment. Pre and post-treatment tumour
sections were stained with the endothelial marker, antibody to FVIII (DAKO).
Microvessel counts were performed by two observers, in high power fields (x250) of
three vascular hot spots using a Chalkley 25 eyepiece graticule. The microvessel count
(mvc) was the total of the counts in the three fields. This study design allowed
comparison of microvessel counts before and after treatment, and correlation of this
change with tumour response.
Results: The median value of microvessel counts for all patients before and after
treatment was 13. Of the 31 patients, 24 responded (77%). The pre-treatment mvc in the
responders was IS (Range: 8-26), compared to 12 (Range: 9-13) in the 7 non-
responders (p=0.0389: Wilcoxon test). There was no significant difference between the
two groups in the post-treatment mvc. The change in mvc with treatment according to
response is illustrated in the table:
Increased mvc Decreased mvc|
Responders 7 m s
Non-res ponders 7 0
p=0.0013 (Fisher's exact test)
There is a highly significant association between change in tumour vascularity and
response to tamoxifen treatment. All non-responders showed an increase in tumour
vascularity and all those tumours in whom the microvessel count decreased responded.

and serum CEA levels to be determined.
MGLVA1 was shown by RT-PCR to express mRNA for MT-MMPI, MMP-7 and
MMP-9. Zymography revealed the presence of MMP-9 activity as well as the
inactive and active forms of MMP-2. For the therapy experiments MGLVA1
tissue was implanted subcutaneously into both male and female nude mice.
Dosing with marimastat (15mg/mi is osmotic mini-pump, equivalent to
approximately 7.2mg/kg/day) began on day 1 and continued throughout the course
of the experiment. Control mice were implanted with vehicle-containing pumps.
Cross sectional tumour measurements were taken twice weekly using callipers.
and animals were terminated when tumour cross sectional area reached 300mm2.
All experimentation was performed according to UKCCCR guidelines.
Marimastat was shown to significantly inhibit tumour size in both male and
female mice when compared with the respective vehicle controls (p=0.0081.
p=0.0306. respectively on day 17, Mann Whitney U non-parametric test).
Marimastat also exerted a significant effect on survival (p=0.001, Log Rank test)
with median survival increasing from 18 days to 30 days.
A further experiment was designed to assess the effect of marimastat on
circulating CEA levels. Marimastat or vehicle was delivered as above, and the
ability of marimastat to significantly inhibit tumour growth was confirmed.
Throughout the course Of the experiment 4 animals of each sex from both treated
and control groups were sacrificed at regular intervals and serum samples were
collected for CEA analysis. It has been shown that log of the CEA concentration
is linearly related to log of the tumour weight. irrespective of whether the tumour
derives from a marimastat or vehicle treated animal.
These results suggest that circulating CEA concentration may be useful as a
surrogate for tumour burden.
P102 EFFECT OF RETINOIC ACID AND
PENTOXIFYLLINE ON HUMAN MELANOMA CELL
EXPRESSION OF uPA AND tPA. C.L.Alexander, M. Edward* and
R.M. MacKie, Department of Dermatology, The Robertson Building,
University of Glasgow, Glasgow G 12 8QQ.
The plasminogen activation system plays an important role in the
metastatic spread of tumour cells and includes various proteases such as
tissue-type (tPA) and urokinase-type (uPA) plasminogen activators,
These enzymes convert plasminogen to plasmin, a broad specificity
enzyme which degrades a range of extracellular matrix molecules thus
contributing to the invasive potential of the tumour cell. In this study, we
have examined the effect of retinoic acid (RA) and pentoxifylline (PX) on
uPA and tPA secretion by the Hs294T and C8161 melanoma cell lines
using a specific ELISA detection system.
We have previously shown that the Hs294T cells are poorly metastatic
in vivo in comparison to the aggressive C8 161 cell line. uPA is known to
bind to a uPA receptor (uPAR) on the cell surface and we were able to
detect membrane-associated uPA in both cell lines using confocal
microscopy. The highly aggressive C8161 cell line secreted a 277-fold
higher level of uPA (1300fg/cell) than the Hs294T cells (4.7fg/cell). We
examined the effect of exposure of the cells to retinoic acid (10-10 - 10-5
M) for 4 days on both uPA and tPA production. At 10-7M RA, uPA
levels were increased 1.2-fold in the Hs294T cells and by 2.2-fold in the
C8161 cells. PX treatment (250[tg/ml) also increased uPA production
2.7-fold in the Hs294T cells and by 1.7-fold in the C8161 cells. The
Hs294T cells which secreted lower levels of uPA were found to produce
higher levels of tPA (25.6fg/cell) compared to the C8161 cells
(4.3fg/cell). RA stimulated a 2.5-fold increase in tPA at 10-7M and a
3.7-fold increase at 10-5M in the Hs294T cells.
These results demonstrate that both PX and RA increase uPA
production, while only PX increases tPA expression in these cell lines.
P104 THERAPEUTIC EFFECT OF THE MATRIX
METALLOPROTEINASE INHIBITOR, MARIMASTAT IN A GASTRIC
CANCER XENOGRAFT MODEL: RELATIONSHIP TO MMP mRNA
LEVELS.
*GM Tierney, HM Collins, TM Morris, SA Watson.

Nottingham, UK
Background: The MMPs are a family ofproteolytic enzymes which regulate
turnover of the extracellular matrix and are implicated in the process oftumour
growth and metastasis. Their inhibition is a novel therapeutic modality.
Marimastat is a synthetic orally available MM? inhibitor which binds to the active
site ofthe MMPmolecule rendering it inactive.
Aims: To evaluate the effect of marimastat on the growth and MMP expression of
human gastric xenografts, MKN45G and ST16 and to relate any observed effect to
a change in MMP mRNA level.
Methods: MKN45G and ST-16 tissue was implanted sub-cutaneously into both
male and female nude mice. Dosing with marimastat (50mg/kg administered via
osmotic mini-pumps) began on day 1 and continued for 28 days. Control mice
were implanted with vehicle containing pumps. Animals were terminated on day
28. All animal experimentation was performed according to UKCCCR guidelines.
Xenograft tissue was taken immediately post termination, mRNA extracted and
reverse transcribed to cDNA. Competitive PCR was performed with a gene
specific external standard. Results were normalised to GAPDH.
Results: Mean tumour mass control vs treatment (MKN45G - 0. 13g vs 0.2g = ns.
ST-16 0.15gvs 0.0lgp<0.05) was recorded ST-16 turnours were not
macroscopically detectable post- marimastat therapy. RT-PCR demonstrated
mRNAs for MvIPs-2, -7 and -9, lIMPs-I and -2 and MT-IMP-I in all xenograft
control samples. MKN45G showed a significant reduction in mRNA for MT-
MMP-1post treatment (p<0.05 Mann-Whitney).
Discussion: Marimastat administration has caused ST-16 xenografts to become
macroscopically undetectable. mRNA analysis suggests that in addition to
blocking the active site of the MvMPmolecule marimastat may exert an indirect
effect at the mRNA level. A significant down-regulation in MT-MMB-1mRNA
has been noted. This enzyme is a potent activator of MMP-2 and as such may play
a pivotal role in the postulated activation cascade of MvPs. This may represent a
feedback loop resulting from blockade of active enzymes by marimastat.

Background: Matrix metalloproteinases are a family of proteolytic enzymes
involved in turnover of the extracellular matrix and have been implicated in the
process oftumour growth and metastases. In particular the gelatinases have been
shown to correlate with the malignant phenotype. Zymography is an
electrophoretic technique which distinguishes active gelatinase from latent pro-
enzyme. The matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, marimastat BB-2516 (British
Biotech Ltd.) has been developed for clinical use in a multicentre phase II trial
in patients with inoperable gastric carcinoma. Endoscopic biopsies of tumour
from these patients before and after one month of treatment have been obtained
and analysed using zymography.
Aims: To examine the profile of latent and active gelatinases present in gastric
cancer samples prior to and after one month oftreatment with marimastat.
Methods: Endoscopic biopsies of gastric cancer from 20 trial patients were
homogenised in denaturing buffer, centrifuged and loaded onto
polyacrylamide/gelatin gels. Electrophoresis was performed. The gel was
incubated with renaturing buffer and developing buffer to reactivate the enzyme.
The gel was stained with Coomassie blue, destained and dried. Gels were then
analysed using a computer assisted image analysis system. Purified human
recombinant 72kDa gelatinase and 92kDa gelatinase markers were used as
standards.
Results: The 92kda and the 72kDa gelatinases were expressed in the tumour
biopsies both prior to and after treatment with the matrix metalloproteinase
inhibitor. Their active forms (82kDa and 62kDa) were also identified on the
gels. After treatment there was no significant change in the quantity of active or
inactive enzyme.
Conclusions: Treatment with a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor for one
month does not affect the enzyme profile of a gastric cancer as shown on
zymography. The denaturing conditions of zymography cause separation of the
inhibitor-enzyme complexes. Further work using RT-PCR is planned to assess
changes at the level ofmRNA.
ROLE OF p53 ON THE CYTOSTATIC VERSUS CYTOTOXIC
P107 EFFECTS OF UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS ON NORMAL
HUMAN UROTHELIAL CELLS IN VITRO

Research Unit, St James's University Hospital, Leeds LS9 7TF, UK.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PuFA) can inhibit the growth of
carcinoma cells in vitro. Normal human urothelial (NHU) cells, which
prolliferate rapidly in vitro, are also growth inhibited by 72h culture in the
presence of n-3 and n-6 PuFA, whereas monounsaturated and saturated
fatty acids had no effect (Southgate et al. Br. J. Cancer 1997; 74: 728).
Although PuFA can induce an apparently irreversible growth arrest at higher
concentrations, it is not clear whether there is a cytotoxic effect distinct from
the cytostatic mechanism operative at lower PuFA concentrations. p53 is
involved cell cycle regulation and cell death, although whether PuFA
operate through p53 is unknown.
NHU cell lines were transfected with the HPV16 E6 gene to disable
p53 function. The effects of short (72h) and long-term exposure to BSA-
complexed n-3 (eicosapentaenoic) and n-6 (linoleic and y-linolenic) PuFA on
NHU and homologous NHU-p53NULL cells was investigated. Cells were
cultured in various PuFA concentrations to identify the maximal tolerated
dose allowing survival for the normal lifespan of the culture.
NHU cells cultured continuously with PuFA showed a reduced
growth rate relative to BSA-only controls. The maximal concentration of y-
linolenic acid tolerated in prolonged culture was 10pM, a non-cytostatic dose
in short-term culture. The maximal sustainable dose for linoleic acid was
4OpM, which decreased thymidine incorporation by some 60-70% in short-
term culture. Cells in eicosapentaenoic acid could sustain a dose of 20jM,
which inhibited thymidine incorporation by 50% in short-term cultures. The
p53NULL cells showed the same response patterns to PuFA as untransfected
cells.
Thus, the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of PuFA on normal human
urothelial cells are distinct phenomena, probably acting through discrete

Antibody-targeted therapy of cancer has significantly improved selective delivery
of antitumnour agents, but clinical problems remain in the form of poor tumour
localisation and toxicity to normal tissues. Specific destruction of tumour
vasculature has greater therapeutic potential than direct tumour cell targeting, but
present strategies frequently fail to destroy all functional vessels. Efficient
treatment of common solid tumours may therefore require a combination of these
different but complementary therapies. We are employing two concomitant
therapies: the anti-vasculature drug 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid
(DMXAA) which inhibits blood flow causing extensive necrosis of the central
tumour zone, and anti-tumour antibodies conjugated to therapeutics which can
destroy the surviving outer zone. We have previously shown that an optimal dose
of DMXAA (27.5mg/kg) did not enhance survival. However, by combining
DMXAA with an antibody-radioisotope conjugate (18.5MBq 13 I anti-CEA
antibody A5B7), which alone inhibits tumour growth by around 30 days, we have
eradicated tumours in 85% of mice [I].
We are currently investigating whether the combined use of DMXAA with
antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) [2] will also enhance
therapeutic potential. In ADEPT therapy a F(ab')2 A5B7-enzyme (carboxypeptidase
G2) conjugate is administered at 25 enzyme units/mouse and allowed to localise to
the tumour and clear from normal tissues. The second phase, the non-toxic prodrug
4-[(2-chloroethyl)(2-mesyloxyethyl)amino]benzoyl-L-glutamic acid (CMDA), is
then delivered at I.5g/kg and converted to a toxic drug by enzyme within the
tumour. It would be therapeutically advantageous to retain either antibody
conjugate or CMDA at the tumour site, and we have found that the massive
haemorrhagic necrosis produced by DMXAA gave a 2-fold increase in tumour
retention of pre-localised conjugate and altered its microdistribution. This novel
complementary treatment also significantly enhanced the therapeutic etfect of
conventional ADEPT, either by allowing greater prodrug activation, by DMXAA
reduction of the tumour burden, or by a combination of the two.

Retinoids, naturally occurring and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A,
have been found to have potent anti-tumour activity in a number of clinical
contexts, including the treatment of pre-malignant oral lesions and prevention of
the occurrence of second primary cancers after resection of the primary tumour.
However, long-term prognosis is still poor, presumably due to malignant cells
escaping retinoid control. Understanding the mechanisms by which retinoids and
their receptors interact with cellular the regulatory pathway and prevent malignant
progression, is an important aspect of the development of novel treatment and
preventive strategies.
We have developed a unique panel of human primary oral cell cultures,
representative of the various stages of tumour progression ie. normal healthy oral
tissue, a range of early dysplasias, late stage tumours and metastasis. Using these
cultures has allowed us to look at differences in expression of the retinoid
receptors and cellular binding proteins, responsible for mediating the biological
effects of the retinoids, at different stages of progression. Northern analysis
showed that there were no consistent changes during oral cancer progression ofthe
levels of the nuclear receptors, retinoic acid receptors a and y (RARs), and
retinoid X receptor-n (RXR) and cellular binding proteins (CRBP and CRABP-II)
expressed in these cells. Previous work has shown that loss of RAR-0 is one of
the most consistent changes occurring during oral cancer progression which is
confirmed in this system. In addition we have demonstrated that RAR-0 loss
occurs early in progression and that this loss is associated with a change in cell
phenotype from senscence to immortality during the dysplasia stage (McGregor et
al., 1998, Cancer Research 57, p3886). In addition this change in phenotype may
occur independently ofthe loss of CDKN2A/pl6 expression. This work is funded

differing concentrations, which imply that different compositions and

P109 IN VIVO EVALUATION OF A LIPOLYTIC
MOBILISING (LMF) FACTOR ISOLATED FROM
PATIENT URINE. Hussey H J* and Tisdale M J, Pharmaceutical
Sciences Institute, Aston University, Birmingham B4 7ET.
A lipid mobilising factor (LMF) was isolated from the urine of
cancer patients with progressive weight loss, using a combination of
ion exchange, exclusion and hydrophobic chromatography to give a
single component of apparent molecular weight 43,000. Biological
activity throughout purification was monitored by the ability to
induce lipolysis in epididymal adipocytes.
Administration of isolated LMF to ex-breeder NMRI mice over a
89h period produced a decrease in body weight without a reduction
in either food or water intake. Body composition analysis showed a
42% reduction in carcass fat in comparison to controls. Treatment of
pure bred obese (ob/ob) mice with human LMF over a 160h period
also produced a decrease in body weight with no effect on either
food or water consumption, There was a reduction of 19%o in
carcass fat without an alteration in water or non-fat mass.
Hypoglycaemia was observed, but was not accompanied by a
change in serum insulin levels. There was a significant increase in
both glycerol (pc0.02) and 3-hydroxybutyrate (p= <0.001) in the
serum, suggesting lipid mobilisation and utilisation. Though
treatment with LMF reduced the content of interscapular brown
adipose tissue in ob/ob, oxygen utilisation per gram of tissue greatly
increased (p= <0.009). Oxygen uptake in brown adipose tissue was
increased by noradrenaline, an action that was reversed by
propranolol. LMF also increased oxygen uptake in brown adipose
tissue, but the action was not reversed by propranolol.
These results show that a LMF isolated from human urine has the
capacity to induce lipid mobilisation and catabolism in mice,
suggesting the potential to exert similar effects in cachectic cancer
patients.

Cancer cachexia is characterized by progression of wasting in adipose
tissue and muscle following tumour growth. Muscle is more important
to the quality of life of cancer patients, but the cause of muscle wasting
is not well understood. We surmised that some plasma factor has an
inhibitory effect on myoblast proliferation, and that the ability of muscle
cells to regenerate decreases following tumour growth. We then
hypothesized that the plasma factor could be removed by plasma
perfusion, and that myoblasts would be able to proliferate from the
satellite cells of the muscles of rabbits whose plasma was perfused. We
therefore measured the proliferation of myoblasts from tumour-bearing
rabbits in primary culture as a means of confirming our hypothesis.
Rabbits implanted with VX2 carcinoma were treated by cyclic plasma
perfusion, and the results was less weight loss and longer survival than
in untreated rabbits. The urinary 3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratio was
less elevated in rabbits treated by cyclic plasma perfusion than in the
untreated rabbits. The DNA synthesis rate of myoblasts from rabbits
treated by cyclic plasma perfusion was much better maintained than in
myoblasts from untreated rabbits. Plasma fractions obtained from a
rabbit with VX2 carcinoma and eluted from a phenyl-Sepharose column
at NaCI concentrations under about 1.0 M decreased the myoblast
proliferation and DNA synthesis. These results suggested that some
humoral factor in plasma of rabbits with VX2 carcinoma inhibits
proliferation of myoblasts and the deterioration of muscle may be
improved by plasma perfusion.

Patients with advanced malignant disease display appetite loss and weight loss
known as cancer cachexia. In this study, we used cachectic rabbits transplanted with
VX2 carcinoma to determine the abnormality of body fat store and lipid metabolism
in comparison with starved rabbits where a simple reduction in food intake causes
loss of body fat. In addition, the effect of plsama fractions from rabbits with VX2
carcinoma or from starved rabbits were examined. After chromatography of plasma
from rabbits with VX2 carcinoma on a phenyl-Sepharose column, a portion of a
fraction was added to the culture medium of murine 3T3-LI adipocytes, and the
amount of glycerol released into the medium was measured as an index of lipolysis.
To other cultures, a plasma fraction obtained in the same way from rabbits without
tumours and fed as usual (controls), or from such rabbits with feed withheld, was
added Glycerol release into medium from 3T3-Ll cells treated with the plasma
fraction of cachectic rabbits or with the same fraction from starved and healthy
control rabbits were 0.370, 0.265 and 0.288 tmol/105 cells in 8hr, respectively.
Intracellular levels of triglycerides for each group was 0.294, 0.316 and 0.340
imol/105 cells, respectively. On the other hand, a piece of adipose tissue was
obtained from three of these groups of rabbits (with cachexia, starved, or fed as
usual) and the incorporation of radiolabelled glucose into glycerides by the tissue was
measured. Incorporation of radiolabelled glucose into adipose tissue from cachectic,
starved, and control rabbits were 15.9, 46.8 and 18.0X 105 cpm/g per hr.
respectively. Glycerol release from the materials were 511, 365, and 201 nmol/g per
hr. These data suggests that pathophysiology characterized to lipid metabolism in
cancer cachexia includes accelerated lipolysis and reduced lipogenesis which were
different from those in starved rabbits, and some humoral factor might be involved in
this abnormality.
P112 THE EFFECT OF FATTY ACIDS ON EPITHELIAL CELL
PROLIFERATION IN ORGAN CULTURE.

Research Unit, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, LS9 7TF.
The mechanisms by which fatty acids (FA) may suppress or
enhance tumour development and/or progression are unclear. The anti-
proliferative or cytotoxic effects of polyunsaturated (PuFA) on carcinoma
derived cell lines may represent a general response of rapidly proliferating
epithelial cells, rather than a feature of the transformed epithelial phenotype.
This would be in agreement with findings that PuFA were growth inhibitory
to normal human urothelial (NHU) cells, which have a high proliferative
index in monolayer cultures (Southgate et al, Br J Cancer 1996; 74:728.).
The aim of this study was to establish the effect of PuFA on urothelial cells
in a homeostatic tissue environment at equilibrium.
Organ cultures were established from surgical specimens of normal
urothelial tissues and maintained at an air-liquid interface. Media were
supplemented with BSA-complexed FA (stearic, oleic, linoleic, y-linolenic, a-
linolenic, icosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids). In all cultures, initial
regeneration of the urothelium was followed by maintenance of a long-term
homeostasis, with low cytoproliferation, preservation of a normal stratified
transitional epithelial morphology and expression of characteristic
differentiation-associated antigens.
Whether added at initiation of culture or following attainment of
equilibrium, PuFA had no apparent effect on urothelial cell proliferation, as
determined by histological criteria or immunolabelling for Ki67/MIB-1. Even
concentrations of PuFA which were irreversibly cytostatic on monolayer
cultures of NHU, did not apparently affect attainment or maintenance of
homeostatic equilibrium. PuFA also had little discernible effect on the
production of basement membrane components (laminin, collagen IV) or on
the expression patterns of E-cadherin or cytokeratin isotypes (CK7, CK8,
CK13, CK17, CK18, CK19) characteristic of the normal tissue in situ and of
control organ cultures.
These findings show that PuFA have little effect on quiescent
urothelial cells in a homeostatic tissue environment, compared with the
dramatic effects on isolated, rapidly-dividing cells in monoculture. This
supports the hypothesis that anti-proliferative effects of PuFA are related to
baseline proliferation rate.

RC-160 (octastatin/vapreotide) is a potent octapeptide analogue of
somatostatin with growth inhibitory activity in experimental tumours in vitro
and in vivo including breast cancer. The efficacy of high dose RC-160 was
studied in 14 women, age range 37 - 80 years (median 58.5 years) and
performance status 0 - 2, with pre-treated metastatic breast cancer. The RC-
160 was administered by continuous s.c. infusion. The starting dose was 3
mg/day in week 1 and was increased to 4.5 mg/day for weeks 2 to 4 and
subsequently to 6 mg/day until end of treatment. A significant reduction in
IGF-I levels occurred by day 7 (p<0.0001) and was maintained throughout
the treatment. The lowest dose of RC-160 produced the maximal IGF-I
response. Although there was no reduction in prolactin levels in patients
whose baseline levels were normal, elevated prolactin levels found in 3
patients fell to within the normal range 7 days after commencing RC-160
treatment. RC-160 was well tolerated with no dose reductions being required.
No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were seen. The most common side-effects were
mild fatigue and diarrhoea the latter being associated with steatorrhoea in 5
cases. Abscess formation developed at the infusion site in 8 patients and
erythema and discomfort was seen in a further 3 patients. A small but
significant rise in fasting blood glucose levels was also recorded (p=0.0012),
the highest level on treatment being 7.6 mmol/L. No objective tumour
responses were observed, all patients showing disease progression within 3
months of commencing treatment. These findings demonstrate that high-dose
RC-160, administered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion, can reduce
serum levels ofthe breast growth factors IGF-I and prolactin but is ineffective
as single agent therapy in the management of metastatic breast cancer.
Encouraging preclinical anti-tumour activity and the favourable toxicity
profile in patients suggest the merit of future studies combining RC-160 with
anti-oestrogens and/or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.

EPITHELIAL REGENERATION,

University ofNewcastle, NE2 4HH.
We have developed a model of intestinal epithelial
regeneration, a process central to inflammatory, ulcerative and
infective diseases ofthe intestine, in order to investigate regulatory
mechanisms which govern this process.
HVman intestinal foetal tissue at 12-20 weeks gestation was retrieved
and washed. The epithelial tissue was then desegregated mechanically
and enzymatically by collagenase and dispase, and then differentially
centrifuged to obtain a homogeneous population of crypt progenitor
epithelium. This preparation was then grafted subcutaneously
(20ul/graft) into SCID (severe combined Immunodeficient) mice and
the graft retrieved at intervals of 7, 14, 21, 35, and 50 days after
grafting to study the morphological features and differentiation
processes.
21/26 grafts were successfully taken. Distinct stages of regeneration
were seen; at early stages of regeneration (7 days) a 'blastema' of
undifferentiated cells were seen, this then gave way to crypt formation
at 21 days, with crypt fission and early morphological features by 35
days, by 50 days cytodifferentiation and morphological maturation was
observed.
We present here a novel method ofhuman intestinal epithelial
regeneration to aid in the study ofmolecular regulation at all stages of
intestinal epithelial regeneration.

Bombesin-like peptides have been shown to be mitogens for human
breast cancer cells but the possibility of an autocrine role for
gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) remains unclear. We have
investigated the production and inactivation of GRP-like peptides
and their growth effects in human breast cancer cell lines. Radio-
immunoassay detected GRP-like immunoreactivity (GRP-LI) in
T47D breast cancer cells but not in their conditioned medium,
indicating rapid degradation. No GRP-LI was found in the ZR-75-
I or MDA-MB-436 cells or their conditioned medium. HPLC
analysis of the GRP-LI in the T47D cells revealed a major
immunoreactive peak whch co-eluted with GRP18-27 and a minor
more hydrophilic peak. In vitro stimulation of T47D cell growth by
bombesin was enhanced to 154% of control levels by the addition
of the selective EC 3.4.24.1 1 inhibitor phosphoramidon (I ngmil 1).
Fluorogenic analysis using whole cells confirmed low levels of this
enzyme on the T47D cells. This phosphoramidon-sensitive activity
was approximately 100-fold less than that measured in the SCLC
cell line NCI H345 where EC 3.4.24.1 1-mediated regulation of
GRP levels has been shown in the past. These results suggest that a
GRP-LI autocrine loop may exist in a subset of breast cancer cell
lines. These peptides are rapidly degraded and inactivated
extracellularly by a enzyme with an EC 3.4.24.11 profile. This
enzyme, previously unreported in human breast cancer cells,
significantly modulates both T47D basal growth and its response to
BN-induced growth.

The surgical manipulation of bowel to form a substitute urinary
bladder is currently used following radical cystectomy for transitional cell
carcinoma. However, it is associated with a number of problems due to the
absorptive/secretory nature of intestinal epithelium compared to the barrier
function of urothelium. We are developing "composite enterocystoplasty" in
which de-epithelialised bowel segments will be relined with urothelial cells
generated in vitro. We have shown that adequate numbers of normal human
urothelial cells can be generated rapidly in vitro (Hutton et aI, J Urol 1993;
150: 721). Cells expanded in vitro will reform a histologically normal
urothelium when seeded onto de-epithelialised bladder stroma in organ
culture (Scriven et al, J Urol 1997; 158: 1147). Prior to the development of a
surgical model in the pig, it is essential to determine if cultured porcine
urothelial cells would form a urothelium, or transdifferentiate into enterocytes
following combination with de-epithelialised stroma from bowel or stomach.
Porcine stomach was de-epithelialised by dissection, leaving the
submucosa. Normal porcine urothelial cells propagated in vitro to passage 2
were seeded onto the de-epithelialised stomach and maintained for 2 and 4
weeks in organ culture. These cells formed a histologically-normal stratified
urothelium by 4 weeks. Collagen IV and laminin were expressed along a
clearly defined basement membrane at the epithelial:stromal junction.
Cytokeratin 13, which is expressed by urothelium but not gastric epithelium
in situ, was positive throughout the neo-urothelium. A urothelial-specific
differentiation marker, AUM, was expressed along the apical edge of the
superficial cells. Identical results were obtained on allogeneic and
autologous tissue recombinations.
Thus, urothelial cells can attach, lay down a basement membrane
and form a stratified urothelium with expression of appropriate urothelial
differentiation antigens when seeded onto stomach sub-mucosa in organ
culture. No evidence was found for tissue-specific or instructive stromal
signalling. These data support the concept of "composite enterocystoplasty".

The ability of cells to respond to extracellular stimuli and to transduce signals
via various pathways is due largely to reversible protein phosphorylation. This is
achieved by the activities of a variety of protein kinases and phosphatasesl. The most
abundant of the Ser/Thr phosphatases include PPI, PP2A, PP2B and PP2C. PPI is
involved in a large number of cellular processes including glycogen metabolism, cell
cycle regulation, RNA splicing and neuronal function".2. The catalytic subunit of PPl
(PPIC) is bound by a number of regulatory subunits including the heat stable
inhibitors: inhibitor-l and inhibitor-2 (IPP-2)3.
IPP-2 was recently found to be differentially expressed between the isogenic
cell lines SW480 and SW6204. SW480 is derived from a primary colon carcinoma and
SW620 is derived from a lymph node metastasis in the same patient. Both PP2AC and
PPIC have been reported to interact with Hox I1, an orphan homeobox gene. HoxlI is
thought to act as an inhibitor of both PP2A and PPI, which disrupts a G2/M cell cycle
checkpoint resulting in genomic instability and oncogenesis5. As both HoxI 1 and IPP-
2 are putative inhibitors of PPI and we have previously shown IPP-2 to be
differentially expressed between SW480 and SW6204, we were also interested in
testing for Hox 11 differential expression in these cell lines.
We have examined the expression of Hox I I in SW480 and SW620 using the
technique of Semi-quantitative RT-PCR6. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR is a sensitive
method for detecting the relative levels of expression of specific genes. We have
modified this technique by inclusion of a CyS-labelled primer in all PCR
amplifications. This renders the resulting PCR product fluorescently labelled which
allows for accurate and sensitive detection and quantification using the ALF express
automated sequencer (Pharmacia). We have found Hox 11 expression to be
upregulated in SW480 relative to SW620. The RT-PCRs were controlled by
amplification in parallel of P-actin. Identification of the Hox 1 RT-PCR product was
confirmed by cloning and sequencing.

P119 SELECTIVE TRAFFICKING OF A TYROSINE-
PHOSPHORYLATED ERBB2 ISOFORM TO THE
GOLGI DISTRIBUTION. Ouyang X.,*, Zhang H.,
Huang G., Moss J., Coulton G., Epstein R.J., Imperial College School of
Medicine, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.
Overexpression of wild-type ErbB2 transforms cells in vitro
and is linked to tumor progression in vivo, but the mechanism by which
this orphan receptor exerts its oncogenic effect remains unclear. Here
we use isoform-specific receptor antibodies and electron microscopy to
show that a tyrosine-phosphorylated ErbB2 subset (PY1222-B2)
immunolocalizes to the Golgi distribution following ligand-dependent
heterodimerization and transphosphorylation by heterologous growth
factor receptors. This localization contrasts with that of activated
epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR*) and a distinct tyrosine-
phosphorylated ErbB2 subset (PY1248-B2), both of which exhibit a
diffuse distribution ofpunctate cytoplasmic immunofluorescence.
Golgi immunostaining of PY1222-B2 is also induced by cell treatment
with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate,
indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation suffices for ErbB2 localization
to this site. Confocal microscopy shows that pre-treatment with the
protein transport blocker brefeldin A (BFA) causes dissolution of Golgi
immunofluorescence and retention of PY1222-B2 on the plasma
membrane, consistent with previously reported effects of BFA on
receptor internalization. Immunoblotting studies reveal that BFA
priming also diminishes the EGF-inducible PY1222-B2 signal, and that
this is in turn associated with shortened EGFR* signalling and EGFR
expression. These findings suggest that PY1222-B2 is endocytically
targeted to the trans-Golgi network - perhaps reflecting the lack of a
lysosomal targeting motif- and raise the possibility that unliganded
ErbB2 may promote tumor growth by 'hijacking' liganded hetero-
oligomers to a receptor recycling pathway.

Urinary EGF levels are decreased in bladder cancer patients (Messing and Murphy-
Brooks, 1994; Chow et al., 1994). EGFR overexpression is associated with poor
prognosis (Mellon et al., 1995) and is noted most often in patients with invasive
tumours. EGF binding to the urothelial receptor is inhibited at acidic pH (Hagler et
al., 1980). Urinary EGF levels may therefore be higher when pH is less than seven.
This study aims to determine whether there is an association between reduced urinary
EGF levels, increased urinary pH and EGFR overexpression in tumour tissue from
bladder cancer patients.
First morning urine samples were collected from 15 bladder cancer patients just prior
to tumour resection. The pH was recorded and urinary EGF levels determined using
a sandwich ELISA technique (R&D). Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue from
the resected tumours was stained by the avidin-biotin complex using the Ab4 EGFR
antibody (Oncogene Science).
EGFR positive patients (mean 14.2 ng EGF/mg creatinine) had significantly
(p=0.0465) lower levels of urinary EGF than EGFR negative patients (mean 20.4 ng
EGF/mg creatinine). The mean urinary pH for EGFR positive and negative patients
was 6.0 and consequently pH was not significantly associated with EGF or EGFR
status.
These results suggest that EGFR overexpression but not urinary pH may account for
the reduction in urinary EGF levels in bladder cancer patients.

TGFr, is one member ofa family ofregulatory proteins having
variable effects depending upon the cell type, stage ofdifferentiation
and ambient growth conditions. It is generally growth inhibitory on
epithelial cells, acting via three surface receptors (Type I, II and [H)
to regulate GI to S-phase progression via cyclin dependent kinase
inhibitors (CDKIs) p 15, p2 1 and p27. In colon tumour progression,
TGFr, responses are lost.
Itz-vitro proliferation studies were undertaken using flow cytometry
to measure cell cycle, BrDu incorporation. growth factor receptor,
and CDKI expression in colon cancer cell lines.
Under serum-free conditions, SW742 cells were unresponsive to
TGFO, whilst HT29 cells were growth inhibited. BrDu analysis
confirmed cell cycle measurements and did not reveal any changes in
cell cycle rate. Both cell lines expressed lower levels ofType I
receptor than Type H. All receptor expression was reduced by TGFO,

P121 THE ROLE OF JAK / STAT SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION THE
RESISTANCE OF MELANOMA TO INTERFERON TREATMENT

Interferon a is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma, with a response
rate in advanced disease of 16%. Recently, the ECOG 1684 study has demonstrated a
long term survival benefit in an adjuvant setting for patients with resected high risk
primary disease treated with high dose interferon a2b. However this benefit is limited
to only 1% of patients. These clinical observations suggest heterogeneity in the
response of melanoma cells to interferon. Similar variation in response has also been
demonstrated in melanoma cell lines in-vitro. An important pathway for signal
transduction by interferon, is via the Janus Kinases (Jaks) and Signal Transducers and
Activators of Transcription (STATs), although interferon is also known to activate
other signalling pathways. Defects in Jak / STAT signalling may be responsible for
the interferon resistance of melanoma cells both in-vitro and clinically.
Eight established melanoma cell lines were screened for their sensitivity to
the anti-proliferative effects of interferons. Of these, MM418 was found to be the
most sensitive with growth inhibition of 80-100%, whereas MeWo was the most
resistant cell line, with growth inhibition of 10-40% depending on the class of
interferon used. By flow cytometry, both cell lines were demonstrated to have
components of the type I and type interferon receptors. Also both cell lines
upregulate MHC Class I in response to type I and type II interferons, and MHC Class
11 in response to type 11 interferon.
Both MM418 and MeWo express the components of the Jak / STAT
signalling pathway, as detected by immunoprecipitation and western blotting. Ligand
binding induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of these components as
demonstrated by western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Furthermore,
on analysis by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, both cell lines are capable of
forming functional, DNA-binding ISGF3 complex, STATI and STAT3.
These findings suggest that the resistance of MeWo cells to the anti-
proliferative effects of interferons is not due to defects in Jak / STAT signalling, but
rather due to either defects in downstream elements of the anti-proliferative response,
or defects in additional or alternative signalling pathways that are required for this
response. To determine the necessity of Jak / STAT signalling in the anti-proliferative
response, these cell lines have been transfected with dominant negative Jak I and Jak
2 mutants.
P123 THE EXPRESSION OF THE NOVEL PROINFLAMMATORY
CYTOKINE EMAP-2 IN LUNG TUMOURS, Maarten Tas'*,
Lisa Jones', Andy Lee', Colin Clelland2, James Carmichael' and Cliff Murray',
1CRC Department of Clinical Oncology, 2Department of Histopathology, City
Hospital, Nottingham, UK
Endothelial monocyte-activating polypeptide 2 (EMAP-2) is a novel tumour-
derived cytokine with proinflammatory properties, modulating endothelial cells,
monocytes and granulocytes in vitro, and inducing an acute inflammatory
response and tumour regression in vivo (Kao et al., 1994, J. Biol. Chem. 269;
25106). EMAP-2 is believed to be synthesised as a 34kDa precursor which is
converted to the active 22kDa form. Using polyclonal (PoAb) raised against
recombinant human EMAP-2 we studied the distribution of EMAP-2 in normal
lung, small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and
carcinoids. In normal lung tissue some smooth muscle cells and macrophages
were found to be positive. In tumours, macrophages in some infiltrates were
positive and in several cases diffuse staining of the stroma was observed.
Tumour cells in all carcinoids were strongly positive, the well-differentiated being
the most positive, showing cytoplasmic granular staining. The more poorly
differentiated small cell lung cancer cells were negative or showed slight diffuse
staining. The well differentiated adenocarcinomas were also positive. Several of
the moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinomas showed slight diffuse
staining. The strong granular staining of well differentiated carcinoids in
immunohistology correlated with the presence of a 34 kDa band, corresponding
to proEMAP, detected by Western blotting. Less differentiated carcinoids, with
more diffuse staining, showed less proEMAP and more of the processed forms of
EMAP-2 (27, 20 and 18 kDa). These data suggest that processing of EMAP may
vary between tumours and may be related to tumour differentiation.

The proximal promoter of the Macrophage Inflammatory Protein
1-beta (MIP-1 p) drives expression in macrophages which is
induced upon LPS activation (Profitt J. et al., 1995., Gene.
152:173-179). Utilising the MIP-1I3 promoter to target expression
to antigen presenting cells within the proinflammatory immune
response, we aim to activate specific anti-cancer T cells. MIP-1I
promoter P-galactosidase reporter transgenic mice have been
generated and reporter gene expression analysed at the RNA and
protein level. By staining viable cells with a fluorogenic P-
galactosidase substrate (Fluorescein di-p-D-galactopyranoside) a
B220 (CD45R)+, MHC class II+ splenocyte population and a
CD4, CD8, CD3 thymocyte population have been identified.
Macrophages and Dendritic cell expression are currently being
analysed by antibody staining.
P-galactosidase has been used as a surrogate anti-
tumour T cell antigen in dendritic cell mediated tumour
immunotherapy (Specht J.M. et al., 1997., J.Exp.Med.
186(8):1213). Following adoptive transfer of MIPLACZ bone
marrow and specific cell populations to normal syngeneic mice
we intend to analyse the T cell response to 0-galactosidase
expressing tumours.

The aim of these studeis is to improve the clincial "usefullness' of BCG.
Our approach involves genetic modification of BCG and other strains of
mycobacteria to make them more immunogenic.
Intravesical immunotherapy for CIS with live BCG vaccine is effective.
However, 30% will not respond and there are occaisional serious complications.
BCG works by promoting antigen specific and non-specific immune responses.
Our previous studies have shown difference in the cytokine profiles between
responders and non-responders. Therefore we are engineering cytokine-secretion
by M. bovis BCG and M. smnegmatis for cancer therapy.
Using E.coli-mycobacterial "shuttle" plasmids, expression of recombinant
genes is driven via the heat-shock-protein promotors hsp60 and hsp7O. The BCG
alpha-antigen signal sequence is used to facilitate secretion of recombinant
proteins from the mycobacteria. Whilst cytokine expression is driven by the
hsp70 promotor. expression of A victoria green-fluorescent-protein (gfp) is
driven by hsp60. When excited by UV or laser radiation gfp emits visible green
light making it particularly useful for localizing and tracking mycobacteria.
The levels of cytokine expression are highly heterogeneous; EL-7
(10pg/mnl), IL-8 (50ng/ml).. IL-15 (300pg/ml), RANTES (20ng/ml), MCP-1
(50tng/ml), TNFa (100ng/m!). Importantly, these cytokines are in biologically
active form. In particular we have studied the effect of r.M. sineginatis-TNF in
vitro. Unlike wild-type bacteria these organisms can enhance the display of co-
stimulatory molecules on bladder tumour cells and augment secretion of
proinfllunmnatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF and IL-8. Bacteria recombinant
for the gfpigene hlave been studied by immunolluorescent microscopy and tlow-
cytometry. In particular we have studied their interaction with bladder tumour
cell lines.
The unique difficulties of gene expression in mycobacteria, our initial results
on the biological activities of inycobacterial-derived cytokines. and the future
uses for this system to express tumour antigens will be discussed.

P125 INVESTIGATION INTO THE USE OF INTERLEUKIN (IL)-15
AS AN IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT IN RENAL

IL-1 5 is a proinflammatory cytokine with a number of actions in
common with IL-2 as a result of shared receptor usage. IL-2 is a central
component in immunotherapy for renal cancer, but the optimal dose is
limited by significant toxicity. IL-15 displays a reduced toxicity to IL-2
in mouse models and therefore may provide an alternative or parallel
therapeutic option in renal cancer. In view of the chemoattractant and
proliferative actions of IL-15 on PBMC, induction of IL-15 secretion by
renal cells could potentially induce local anti-tumour immune responses.
We have demonstrated that IL-15 mRNA is present in a panel of
malignant and normal renal cells using RT-PCR, but with no detectable
secretion of IL-15 protein as measured by sensitive ELISA and
biological assay. Importantly, renal cells express an incomplete set of
IL-15 receptor components (IL-15Ra 8/12; IL-2Rp 12/14; IL-2Ry 0/14)
and proliferation of renal cells is not affected by exogenous IL-15.
We are currently investigating a range of candidate stimuli for
induction of IL-15 secretion from renal cells. A mixed lymphocyte-
tumour culture model using renal cells has been established to
investigate the therapeutic potential of IL-15 as an anti-tumour agent.

While allogeneic BMT is a viable therapeutic option for both acute and chronic
leukaemia, the problem of disease relapse remains. Possible rescue options in
relapsed leukaemia include consolidation chemotherapy or a second BMT but
these options are complicated by disease resistance and toxicity effects. A third
option is an immunotherapeutic approach involving the infusion of donor
lymphocytes from the original donor. This has proved successful option in >
70% of chronic myeloid leukaemia(CML) patients indicating a strong graft versus
leukaemia effect. To date we have performed DLI procedures on 6 CML patients
who have relapsed from 1-7 years post BMT. A clinical response was seen in all
patients following a short period of cytopenia and a clinical remission has
persisted for 6 months - 3.5 years post DLI. Polymorphic STR-PCR and RT-
PCR detection of bcr-abl transcripts(the leukaemia specific transcript seen in
CML) was performed at serial timepoints in unseperated peripheral blood or bone
marrow and in selected lineages including CD34 and CD2 lineages. Lineage
selection was performed using dynabeads attached to the appropriate monoclonal
antibody and PCR techniques were modified to allow direct "dynabead PCR".
STR-PCR and RT-PCR of bcr-abl has indicated a true"molecular cure" in these
patients. In contrast to CML, the response rate to DLI in acute leukemia
particularly ALL; is very poor. We report an 11 year old boy with My+ALL who
was transplanted in CR1 using a female unrelated donor mismatched at the DRB3
locus. The graft was T-cell depleted ex-vivo with Campath-lM and complement.
Engraftment was prompt as judged by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridisation
(FISH) and STR-PCR. The patient subsequently relapsed on day 172 post BMT
but remission was achieved with Vincristine and prednisolone. DLI was
performed at day +294 post BMT and the patient responded within 6 weeks. The
patient is currently well with complete donor chimerism and no evidence of
disease at 1 year post DLI. Thus DLI can exhibit an antileukaemic effect in both
chronic and acute leukameia and is an effective therapeutic option in the
majority of CML patients who relapse post allogeneic BMT. It may also be
effective in certain cases of acute leukaemia and should be considered if no other
therapeutic option is available.

We have studied cytotoxicity, proliferation and expression
of activation markers in purified NK cells from heal-thy
Senior donors. The results show that whereas NK, LAK,
and CD16 redirected lysis are not significantly affected
in healthy elderly people, the expression of activation
markers in NK cells and their induction in response
to Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is significantly different
to that of NK cells from young donors. Thus the expression
of HLA-DR and CD95 (Apol/fas) is significantly increased
in NK cells from senior donors while the expression
of CD69 is decreased when compared to their expression
in NK cells from young donors. IL-2 activation of
NK cells induced CD69 expression in NK cells from
young donors in a Protein Tyrosin Kinase (PTK) dependent
but Protein Kinase C (PKC) independent pathway. However
in elderly people the induction of CD69 by IL-2 was
di fferent, i n the different individuals. CD69 expression
in NK cells statistically correlated with NK cell
proliferation but not with IL-2 enhancement of NK
cytotoxicity. IL-2 activation of NK cells also induced
"de novo" fas expression in NK cells from young donors
and enhanced fas expression on NK cells fromt elderly
donors. Crosslinking of fas in IL-2 activated NK cells
by using anti-fas monoclonal antibodies induced apoptosis
in a similar percentage of NK cells front young and
elderly people. These results indicate that, although
NK cytotoxicity is not significantly affected in healthy
elderly people, changes in the phenotype and in other
NK cell activities can be detected. These alterations
migth be rel ated to T lymphocyte disfuncyion in
senescence.
P128 RETROVIRAL GENE TRANSFER OF IL-18 IN VITRO

ICRF Cancer Medicine Research Unit, St. James 's University Hospital, Leeds, UK
Inteileukin-18 (IL-18) is a 22kDa cytokine which is processed b caspase I
to a biologically active 18.3kDa form which is a potent inducer of IFNy. As a
result IL-18 promotes the development of a cellular, Thl immune respon e,
thought to be important in the destruction of bacterially-infected cells and in
anti-tumour immunity. Previously we have shown that the mRNA for IL-18 is
expressed by bladder. renal and ovarian cancer cell lines but not by neural crest-
derived tumiours (melanoma, neuroblastoma). Despite the expression of IL-18
mRNA . we have not been able to identify IL-18 protein in these cells. The aim
of this work is to engineer secretion of IL-18 by tumour cells and investigate its
effect on the promotion of anti-tumour immune responses in vitro.
We have cloned the full length IL-18 cDNA into the retroviral expression
vector pBabe.Puro and used the Fly-A13 packaging cell line to produce disabled
retrovirions. Bladder cancer (RT112, EJ18) and melanoma cell lines (A735,
SkMel. MeWo) were infected with retrovirus and mRNA measured using
Northern blot and protein via indirect bioassay and Westem blotting. The effect
of IL-18 transfected cells on the activation of allogeneic PBMC was studied in
vitro.
A l.4kbp sub-genomic and a 3.Okbp genomic transcript was identified in all
transfectants. Bladder cancer cells also expressed the 1.lkbp transcript as
expected. Supematants from transfectants induced low levels of IFNy secretion
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Co-culture of allogeneic
PBM1ICs with transfected tumour cells did not increase their proliferation, and
only augmented their cytotoxic activity against tumour targets in 1/5 tumours
tested.
Failure to intduee IfNy iS likely to be due to the lack of processing of pro-L-
18. Therefore we hlave recently cloned the mnature 18.3k-Da form of IL-IX into
the retroviral systetn and are investigating its function. We shall discuss our
recent fintdines with retroviral transduction of bladder tutnour cells with mature-
IL-18 attd the possible role of IL-18 in immune responses to cancer.

P129 VOLUME-SENSITIVE CHLORIDE CURRENTS IN THE HUMAN
BREAST CANCER CELL LINE ZR-75-1, M.R. Preston', 0. Alalami', J.H.J. Martin' &

It is known that expression of the 170 kDa protein P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is
responsible for multidrug resistance (MDR), characterised by development of
tumour cell resistance to a wide range of cytotoxic drugs. P-gp acts as an ATP-
dependent transporter, increasing drug efflux and preventing effective therapy.
Various studies have demonstrated that the expression of P-gp in a number of cell
types is associated with chloride (Cl-) currents which are activated by cell swelling
(reviewed by Higgins, 1995). Tamoxifen is known to block the swell-activated Cl-
conductance (Zhang et al., 1994) and modulate the P-gp transporter in cancer cells
(Fisher et al., 1996), both actions are independent of action via the oestrogen
receptor. We have examined the breast cancer cell line ZR-75-1 for the presence of
swell-activated Cl- currents using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp
technique.
Cells were bathed in a NaCl isotonic saline, pH7.4 and were dialysed with pipette
solution containing NMDG-CI, ATP (2mM) and tamoxifen (10 microM), pH7.4.
Cells were held (Vh) at -60 mV and stepped from -120 to +60 mV in 2OmV
increments. Using this protocol cells bathed in the isotonic saline displayed an
outward Cl- current of 3.0±1.1 pA/pF at +6OmV. Upon exposure to an 75%
hyposomotic solution the cells showed an increase in the CY current to
20.4±10.2pA/pF (n1l 1, P<0.001, paired t-test), which was reversible upon returning
to isotonic conditions. The conductance was confirmed to be selective for Cl- after
replacement ofthe bath solution with a low Cl- solution reduced the outward current.
In the absence of ATP there was no increase in current after exposure to hypotonic
solution (from 2.2±0.4 pA/pF to 3.6±2.2 pA/pF, n=3), indicating ATP dependency.
Exposure of swollen cells to 10 microM 4-(OH)-tamoxifen (n=3) and 10 microM
tamoxifen (n=l) reduced the outward current by 71-82% and 90% respectively. We
have confirmed that ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells have a swell-activated Cl-
conductance, which is ATP dependent and is reduced by tamoxifen and 4-(OH)-
tamoxifen. These results resemble previous investigations on other cell types which
have been shown to express P-gp, hence the swell-activated Cl- conductance in ZR-
75-1 cells may be associated with P-gp and MDR.

P131 INDUCTION OF CTL RESPONSES BY RETROVIRALLY
TRANSDUCED HUMAN DENDRITIC CELLS

Amsterdam, Present Address: ICRF Cancer Medicine Research Unit, St James's University Hospital,

The use of tumour-antigen transduced dendritic cells to stimulate anti-tumour
responses from autologous T lymphocytes was studied. CD83+ dendritic cells were
diffentiated from cultured CD34+ cells, obtained from leukapherised blood, using an
immunomagnetic cell sorter, and incubated in medium containing a cocktail of
cytokines (TNF alpha, SCF, GMCSF). At day one the cultured CD34+ cells were
retrovirally transduced with single tumour antigens (MART, MAGE 3, GPIOO and
Tyrosinase) or a polyepitope containing three HLA A2 restricted T cell epitopes (one
derived from influenza and two from HPV 16) and a mouse restricted epitope. The
constructs contained as a marker gene, enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP).
Transduction was shown not to alter the cell phenotype as determined by FACS
analysis (CDIa, CD4, CD Ilc, CD14, CD40, CD54, CD80, CD83, CD86, class II).
Furthermore the stability of transduction over two months was demonstrated by
FACS analysis of the eGFP signal. The ability to present transduced tumour antigen
was also examined, by the use of T cell clones specific for HLA A2 restricted
epitopes of the tumour antigen of interest. T lymphocyte anti-tumour responses were
analysed by cytotoxicity assays following repeated stimulation by transduced
dendritic cells in an autologous MLR, cultures were restimulated at weekly intervals.
Preliminary results show that dendritic were able to present epitopes effectively with
recognition of above 20% with a 3:1 target effector ratio using T cell clones. After
two stimulations with the polyepitope transduced dendritic cells, T cells produced
50% lysis of an autologous transduced B cell line at an effector:target ratio of 90:1,
recognising the influenza epitope.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disorder where plasma cells accumulate in the
bone marrow. The use of FISH to analyse the DNA of MM patients has shown that
rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus at 14q32 can occur in up to
70% ofcases, such a frequency can not be detected using conventional cytogenetics. In MM
such rearrangements are localised to switch regions, sequences which are normally
associated with isotype switching events at the IGH locus. Cyclin Dl located on chromosome
1 1q13 is commonly dysregulated as a result ofa translocation ofthis gene into the IGH locus
in mantle cell lymphoma. Similar translocations, only into the switch regions, are also seen
in MM and the overexpression of cyclin Dl occurs as a result of such a translocation. We
have used an RT-PCR assay to look for cyclin DI overexpression in patient material.
Following reverse transcription, a competitive PCR is utilised to monitor the expression of
cyclin Dl against that of cyclins D2 and D3. We have studied 12 MM patients using the
same RT-PCR assay and have found no evidence ofcyclin DI overexpression suggesting that
in clinial cases of MM cyclin Di overexpression is not a common event. We have also used
this assay to demonstrate cyclin Dl overexpression in a novel myeloma cell line, K620.
Interestingly cytogenetic analysis of K620 cells has shown that there is no translocation of
the II q 13 locus to 1 4q32, but rather to other loci (1q32 and 8q24), suggesting an
alternative, novel mechanism for cyclin Dl dysregulation.
Evidence suggests translocations involving switch regions in MM are nearly universal and
involve a promiscuous array of partner loci. Genes such as cyclin Dl and FGFR3 have been
identified in MM cell lines but clearly only patient material will yield evidence for
representative molecular events. We have used Southern blotting to screen patients but this
lacked the required sensitivity and so have gone on to devise a strategy where FISH will
initially identify translocations into switch regions. A PCR-based method will then allow
the identification and isolation of translocation breakpoints occurring within switch region
sequences upstream of the g, y and a constant regions of the IGH locus. Firstly synthetic
oligonucleotide linker units, called Vectorettes, are ligated to restriction digested genomic
DNA. Amplification is then undertaken using primers complementary to sequences close to
the various switch regions and the Vectorette linker. Vectorettes are designed containing a
central mismatching region so that they are only amplified when attached to the end of a
DNA fragment, and only after extension has occurred from the target sequence primer
during the first cycle. Using this method ofVectorette-PCR we have isolated the breakpoints
from JJN3 and K620 cell lines associated with g switch regions. We are currently applying
this strategy to DNA isolated from the bone marrow and blood of MM patients.

CANCER CELLS ENHANCES ANTI-TUMOUR IMMUNE
RESPONSES INVITRO. RW Carter, RE Banks, AM Jackson*, PJ Selby and
PMPatel. ICRF Cancer Medicine Research Unit, St James's University Hospital,
Leeds, UK LS9 7TF
Interleukin-12 plays a central role in cell-mediated immunity, enhancing
proliferation and cytotoxicity of activated T and NK cells and inducing interferon-
gamma production. We have investigated the effect of exogenous IL-12 and
retroviral gene transfer of IL-12 on the allogeneic immune response to bladder
cancer cell lines.
Recombinant retrovirus encoding the p35 subunit, the p40 subunit and both
subunits together were engineered. These were used to transduce EJ and RT112
cells singly or in combination. No IL-12 secretion was detected when the p35
subunit alone was expressed. However when EJ but not RT1 12 were transduced
with the p40 subunit alone, functional IL-12 was secreted. Functional IL-12 was
produced when both subunits were transduced.
Allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes were incubated for 7 days with the
parental tumour cell lines in the presence or absence of exogenous IL-12 and
cytotoxicity against the parental tumour was assessed in a standard chromium
release assay. Addition of exogenous IL-12 to the co-cultures increased the killing
activity in the EJ co-cultures against the parental tumour and against K562 cells.
This effect was seen in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations of IL-12
ranging from 10-10OOpg/ul. This killing could be abrogated by 100 fold cold K562
inhibition. This effect was not seen with RT112 cells which failed to generate any
cytotoxicity.
EJ cells but not RT112 cells engineered to secrete IL-12 increased generation of
cytotoxic activity of co-cultured lymphocytes. This activity could also inhibited by
cold K562 inhibition.
Lymphocyte subsets following co-culture with IL-12 and IL-12 secreting tumour
cells were analysed by FACS. An increase in CD56 and CD69 positive cells was
seen in all cultures containing IL-12. There was variation in the extent of this
increase in different donors.

P133SlDEtIFICATION OF URIDLNE AS AN MMU`NE
P133 SUPPRESSIVE MEDIATOR IN OESOPHAGEAL CANCER.
J.F.Kenny*, G.O'Sullivan, F.Shanahan, and J.K.Collins; Depts.of Microbiology,
Medicine and Surgery, University College, Cork, Ireland.
Background: Tumours may only survive within an immunocompetent host by
escaping immunological surveillance through poor immunogenicity, or by
inhibiting the immune response directed against it. In our studies of oesophageal
carcinoma, we have shown that prmas-esophageal tumours induce a regional
immunosuppression within the host. We have established in our lab an oesophageal
squamous carcinoma, OC2, which produces profound immunosuppression. In this
report, we identified uridine as a potent mediator of OC2 tumour-associated
immunosuppression. Methods: OC2 cells were grown as monolayers and as
xenografts in nude mice with the resulting tumours used in explant production.
Crude explant was fractionated using ultrafiltration to allow assessment of low
mol.wt. suppressor molecules. A phenylboronate column was used to selkctively
extract nucleotides. Specific molecular identification was done using dire,, probe
mass spectrometry. Urines were collected from healthy human volunteer ('n'5)
and from patients with established oesophageal or colonic tumours (n 20) for
uridine analysis. Rev.Phase C18 HPLC column was used for low mol.wt. profitt s of
explant and tumour urines. Cell proliferation was measured by trypan bic cell
counts, [3H]-nucleotide incorporation assays, and cell cycle analysis by FACS.
Actinomycin D was used to determine whether RNA breakdown was the uridine
source. Results: We have previously shown that TGF-f was secreted by the OC2
tumour at immunosuppressive levels. Elimination of TGF-f by ultrafiltration
allowed examination of low mol.wt. species such as modified nucleosides. Using
rev.phase HPLC, a large bioactive immunosuppressive peak was detected in the
mM conc. range. This was identified as uridine by mass spectrometry. Uridine at
this conc. range of 1-2mM was found to be potently inhibitory for PBLs and cells of
lymphoid/myeloid lineage, whilc 0(fi) cells tolerated high uridine concentrations.
Investigation of human tumour urines showed that 15% had elevated uridine levciS.
Analysis of monolayer supernatants of other epithelial lines showed a similar
uridine release to OC2 cells. Actinomycin D treatment of OC2 cells showed only a
moderate decrease in uridine release. Conclusions: Tumours have been shown to
release a variety of low mol.wt. suppressors, including nucleosides. The finding of
uridine in such high concentrations was completely unexpected. Uridine may be a
simple, relatively ubiquitous suppressor and may provide an opportunity for
metabolic reversal. While RNA turnover is a common source of excreted modified
nucleosides, OC2-derived uridine may be associated with excessive metabolic
biosynthesis. Uridine may also serve as a neoplastic marker for established disease.
P135 TME EFFECT OF RECOMBINANT BCG SECRETING
IL-15 ON ACTIVATION OF PBMC Zhu X*, Petel P, Selby P, Jackson
A.M. ICRF Cancer Research Unit, St. James's University Hospital,
Leeds, LS9 7TF
Live BCG vaccine has been successfully used in the treatment of
bladder cancer. Genetically engineering BCG and other non-
pathogenic mycobacteria ( e.g. M. smegmatis and M. vaccae ) to
secrete cytokines including IL-15 is thought to be a way to improve the
clinical efficacy for cancer treatment.
IL-15 cDNA, which was amplified from reverse transcribed RNA
obtained from activated PBMC, was cloned into the pMOD-8
mycobacterial expression vector, clones were established in BCG and
M.smegmatis by eletroporation. The IL-15 secretion level from clones
of M. smegmatis was 250 pg/ml (measured by ELISA), and the
secretion level of IL-15 in BCG was even lower. A band of 14 Kda (the
expected size of secreted IL-15) was also identified from Western blot
of immunoprecipitation of the supernatant of the bacterial culture.
The supernatant of the clones did not stimulate the CTLL-2 cell line to
proliferate. Suppression of lymphocyte killing activity was shown
when BCG was added into the mixed lymphocyte and tumour ceH
culture (M01=10:1), however, we observed that the recombinant IL-15
BCG could reverse this suppression, akin to the effect of exogenous
IL-15. We hypothesise this is because the recombinant IL-15
rescues PBMC from appotosis caused by BCG.

P134 DEVELOPMENT OF A POLYEPITOPE DNA VACCINE
FOR CANCER. S.G. Smith*, P. Johnson, P.M. Patel, P.J. Selby and A.M. Jackson.
ICRF Cancer Medicine Research Unit, St. James's University Hospital, Beckett Street,
Leeds, LS9 7TF.
As the functions of many tumour associated antigens (TAA's) are unknown or often
transforming, vaccines containing the full length cDNA's encoding these antigens are
inherently dangerous. The combination ofa number of minimal epitopes derived from
TAA's as a polyepitope vaccine would remove this risk and allow vaccination against
a number ofantigens at once. Recent years have revealed DNA vaccines as potent
stimulators of the immune response with many advantages over peptide-based
vaccinations, for example prolonged antigen expression and ellicitation ofboth cellular
and antibody responses, (Tighe et al., 1998, Immunology Today, 19:89).
In a pilot study, 17 epitopes from the gp75, gpI00, MART-1, tyrosinase, BAGE,
MAGE, GAGE and p15 tumour antigens were combined in a plasmid vector.
Following transfection ofNA-8MEL melanoma cells, 3/5 epitopes tested for (MAGE-
1, tyrosinase, gpIOO) were shown to be presented on MHC class I when probed with
antigen specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones (unpublished data).
A second generation construct encoding 8 HLA AI or A2 restricted epitopes from
gpIO0, tyrosinase, MAGE-I, MAGE-3 and MART-I has been designed. Following
demonstration ofprotein expression we intend to transfect and retrovirally transduce
cells including professional antigen presenting cells for presentation and to stimulate
naive T-cell responses in vivo following naked DNA administration.

epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) expression in Oral Squamous Cell
Carcinomna (OSCC). Cannell H & Nouri AME*. Depts. Oral & Max. Surg.
& Med. Oncol. The Royal London Hospital. London. UK.
Background. In recent years investigation of the mechanisms for the
development of human malignancies have focused amongst other areas upon:- a)
escape from the immune system, b) induction of local anergy and c) induction of
growth factor receptors.
The aim of the current studies was to utilize various techniques including
immunocytochemical and cytotoxicity assays as well as an animal model of
OSCC to investigate these three areas.
Results
a) tumour escape mechanisms as assessed by loss or defective expression of
major histocompatibility antigens (MHC), as these molecules play a central role
for recognition of self from non-self showed losses or defective expression
(n=25) for Class I in 4% complete losses(monomorphic) and 80% defective
(polymorphic) of cases of OSCC. Class II antigens not normally expressed on
epithelial cells were expressed in 12/24 (50%) cases indicating local immune
activation.
b) Epidermal growth factor receptor was expressed in 11/12 (91%) OSCC cases
compared with 4/25 (16%7c) of the benign ameloblastoma thus demonstrating the
relevance of this molecule in determining tumour aggressiveness.
c) Pre-immunization in a hamster model of OSCC with a suspension of
autologous tumour resulted in a significant delay in subsequent grafted tumour
growth (52.0+52mg versus 25.7+19.4 p=0.05 using ten animals per group tested.
Mixing of autologous single cell suspension of irradiated tumour cells with
normal spleen cells resulted in a significant decrease in efficiency of spleen cell
killing using a standard tumour target in an vitro cytotoxicity assay thus
demonstrating suppression of killing activity of the latter.
Conclusions. The data indicates that:- loss or defective class I antigen: over-
expression of EGFr: induction of local anergy: are each phenomena associated
with the potential for escape from surveillance as well for aggressiveness of
OSCC. The findings may pave the way for enhancing immune related
mechanism and/or suppression of growth factor receptors as treatment modalities
for use in these patients.

P137 EXPRESSION OF ECK AND LERK-1 DURING
MELANOMA PROGRESSION. David J Easty", Mary
E Fallowfield2 and Dorothy C Bennett', I St George's Hospital Medical
School, London, UK; and 2 Western Infirmary, Glasgow, UK.
The receptor tyrosine kinase ECK is overexpressed in most
melanoma cell lines; the pathology where this elevation is
initially manifested, and its possible role in tumor progression
are unknown. To determine this we studied biopsies of benign
and malignant melanocytic lesions. Normal melanocytes,
benign compound nevi, and dysplastic melanocytes did not
contain ECK, whereas it was detected in 20% of biopsies of
malignant melanoma in situ (MMIS). Primary and metastatic
melanomas did not contain immunoreactive ECK. LERK-1
(the ligand for ECK) is a melanoma growth factor (Easty et al.,
Cancer Res. 55: 2528-32, 1995); in addition, it is angiogenic
and a chemoattractant for endothelial cells. LERK-1 co-
localised with ECK in MMIS, but was also found in vertical
growth phase (advanced) primary melanomas (43%) and
metastatic melanomas (67%). Expression of LERK-1 was
induced in melanoma cells by proinflammatory cytokines.
These findings are consistent with two possible roles for
LERK-1 in melanoma development, it may: (1) promote
melanocytic cell growth or survival in early lesions, and (2)
induce vascularization in advanced melanomas; both of these
effects may be potentiated by an inflammatory stimulus.
P139 Development ofnew monoclonal antibodies
specificfor testis tissue. Dabare AANPM. Nouri AME and
Oliver RTD. The Royal Londonl Hospital. London.UK.
Background. Early detection of malignant cells has had a big impact on
the success of clinical management of human malignancies.
For this study a preparation of single cell suspension prepared from testis
tissue of a patient with seminoma was used to develop monoclonal
antibodies (Mabs) specific for germ cell tumours using Balb C mice. The
specificity of these Mabs on various specimen was assessed by the
conventional immunocytochemical staining technique. The data from
two of the Mabs i.e. ATC1 and ATC2 developed are selected for
presentation in this abstract.
Results.
ATC1. Screening of tissue biopsies from normal and malignant specimens
showed negative staining on all the cases except a layer of cells just within
the seminiferous tubules of tissue sections of testis with apparent normal
morphology, most probably Sertoli cells.
ATC2. This Mab was found to show negativity on all normal tissues
tested. In addition samples from tumours including bladder, kidney,
prostate, head and neck, melanoma and leukemic cells were also found to
show negative staining. The only type of tissues showing strong
positivity with ATC2 was germ cell tumour particularly seminomas.
Screening of established human tumour cell lines of various origins
showed staining patterns ranging from strong positivity in head and neck
tumours (Hep2, KB ) to small percent positivity in breast ( MCF7, T47D)
to complete negativity bladder (Fen, Wil). Biochemical analysis of the
target antigen for ATC2 showed to have a molecular weight of about 70
Kd and strong thermotolerance.
Conclusion. These findings demonstrated the feasibility of raising specific
Mabs against various components of germ cell tissues. The possible use
of these Mabs for early detection of germ tumours in the semen of
individuals suspected of germ cancers is being explored.
QUANTITATION OF CEA AND OESTROGEN RECEPTOR
P138 EXPRESSION IN HUMAN BREAST CANCERS BY
RADIOIMMUNOLUMINOGRAPHY . R. Watson*, G. M. Boxer, A. Jones. CRC Targeting
and Imaging Group, Department of Clinical Oncology, Royal Free and UCL Middlesex
Medical Schools,, London, NW3 2PF.
Radioimmunoluminography (RILG) is a quantitative assay for measurement of tissue protein
which preserves tissue morphology, for analysis of the relationship between structure and
function. RILG has been established for quantitation of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in
histological sections. The rationale depends upon the use of saturating concentrations of
radiolabelled (1251) antibodies to bind to the antigen present in the section. The distribution
of bound antibody is then digitally mapped using a phosphor imager (Molecular Dynamics)
after exposure of sections to phosphor storage plates. The amount of antigen present will be
proportional to the amount of antibody bound in a given area of the section and can be
calculated from a standard line generated from a nitrocellulose CEA dot blot assay.
In a preliminary study, paraffin sections of breast (7 cases) and colorectal (5 cases)
adenocarcinomas were reacted with 125I labelled A5B7 anti-CEA antibody (69 MBq mg-,).
10ml aliquots of 0.3-5 gg g-l CEA were applied to 0.45mm nitrocellulose (Biorad, U.K.)
and the dots incubated with radioantibody. After incubation (1 hr) and washing in 5 changes
of PBS/Tween (0.05%), sections and dot blots were air-dried and exposed to a phosphor
storage plate overnight before scanning. Control sections of tumour were incubated with
1251-labelled anti-AFP antibody (A161). RILG with 125I antibody to CEA gave a linear
correlation with standards of known CEA concentration (r=0.994). Binding of 125I-antibody
to duplicate sections ranged from 46-161 average counts per pixel for the breast cases and
from 193-700 in the colorectal tumour sections. Concentration of CEA in the colorectal
cancer sections was therefore calculated as ranging from 125-490ng g-1 using the CEA dot
blot calibration. The breast cancers studied had lower RILG counts and mean CEA
concentrations were calculated to be less than 100ng g-1. Visual inspection of RILG images
showed hetrogeneity of antigen expression within each section and this was verified by the
counts measured. Binding of anti-AFP antibody was non-specific and of a much lower order.
Using RILG analysis, patients with breast cancer whose tumours express significant levels
of CEA, can be identified and selected for antibody directed targeted cancer therapy.
A RILG assay using a 125I-labelled antibody (1D5 - Dako Ltd.) against oestrogen receptor
(ER) has also been developed to quantitate levels of hormone in patients tumours. In a pilot
study of S cases of breast carcinoma, saturating concentrations of IDS antibody were
determined as 12.5 jg ml-l. RILG values ranged from 0.1-57 average counts per pixel and did
not correlate with ER status determined in the same patients by the biochemical dextran-
coated charcoal (DCC) assay (range >10-890 fmole g-l). These data support work which has
reported discrepancies between biochemical DCC assays and immunohistochemical results.
Quantitation of ER by RILG can help assess the relationship of patients hormone status
with prognosis of disease and response to treatment.

P140 DISTR1BUrIONOF DT-DIAPHORASE IN MALIGNANT
AND NORMAL HUMANLUNG TISSUE, RMPhillips,
BP Cronin, CM Jarrett, MC Bibby, Clinical Oncology Unit University o
Bradford, Bradford, West Yorkshire, BD7 IDP.
The enzyme DT-diaphorase (DTD, NAD(P)H: Quinone acceptor oxidorectase
EC 1.6.99.2) is involved in the bioreductive activation ofa number ofquinones
and is thought tobe a possible target for enzyme directedprodrug therapy. This
idea is further strengthened by the fact that high DTD activity has been reported
for a number oftumour tp but prtcularly non-small cell lung cancer
suggestng that a oprisat patients could be selected for prodrug therapy.
Although it is clearly important to determine enzyme activity in human
malignancies versus normal tissues, suchbiochemical studies give no indication
ofcellular localisation ofenzyme. In addition tobiochemical ays on tissue
homogenates this ongoing study therefore also assesses tissue tribution of
DTD by the use ofimtmunohichemitry. To date DTD activities varybetween
0 and 308 nmol DCPIP reduced/min/mg in malignant tissue (n=23) wheas in
normal lung tissue they range between 0.48 and 43 nmol/min/mg, For
histoche studies rabbit anti-rat DTD polyclonal antibody was used on wax
blocks ofadjacent tissue samples using an immueroxidAPC technique.
The specificity ofthe antibody was assessed byanECL-Western blotting method,
where binding correlated with previously determined levels ofDT-diaphorase
activity within the cell lines and solid tissues examined Positive staining could
be readily identified in tumour sections although it was not restricted to
malignant tissue. Normal bronchiolar epithelium exhibited strong staining
intensity but normal alveoli were negative. Tumours varied from no staining to
homogeneous staining throughout the sections. Occasionally samples were
largely negative but contained small areas ofconcentrated staining
Biochemical assays showed noDTD activity in these patient suggestng that
enzyme assays alone may give false results. These results suggest that
insufficient information is providedfor patient selection bybiochmical assay
alone but immunostainingforDTD on wax blocks in conjunction with
biochemical assays is feasible and will provide pre information-on the
presence ofenzyme within the tumour.

The maintenance of telomeres is essential to the progression of cells
through a normal, mortal life span. In tumour tissues and immortalised
cells, telomeres are maintained by telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme,
at lengths which are generally shorter than normal tissue. Telomerase is
expressed in 80-90% of cancers and absent in most normal tissues. We have
measured telomerase activity in lung cancer cell lines and lung tumours
using the telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) (Kim, N.W., et
al., 1994, Science, 266: 2011). Four of 4 lung cancer cell lines and 16/20
lung tumours examined contained telomerase activity, which was not
detectable in matching normal tissue. In order to investigate telomerase as a
potential early detection marker for lung cancer, the enzyme will need to be
measured in bronchoalveolar lavage (BL). Using the TRAP in a radioactive
or nonradioactive format, telomerase activity was detected in 7/28 BL
specimens from patients undergoing bronchoscopy for diagnosis of lung
cancer. Issues regarding the effect of telomerase inhibitors in the BL
specimens will be discussed.

P143 DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF TSH
RECEPTOR IN ARCHIVAL THYROID
CARCINOMAS USING 5' NUCLEASE ASSAY
(TaqMan).
Sheils OM*, Sweeney EC. Dept. of Histopathology, Trinity College Dublin
Prognosis in thyroid carcinoma is generally dependent on the patient's age
and stage of turnour at the time of diagnosis. However tumours with several
adverse features such as necrosis or high mitotic index may follow an indolent
course while other seemingly inert ones may rapidly progress and have a fatal
outcome. Proliferation indices using Ki-67 or mitotic counts and apoptotic
counts are useful at either end of the spectrum of differentiation of tumours,
but more accurate prognostication is required to predict the outcome of
tumours whose histological appearance belies their sinister intent.:
Proliferation In thyroid carcinoma Is variably TSH driven and TSH receptor'
(TSHr) status significantly relates to therapeutic response. TSHr expression
was semi-quantitatively assessed in a series of archival thyroid carcinomas
comprising follicular adenomas, follicular, papillary, medullary and
anaplastic carcinomas. Total RNA was extracted from formalln fixed
paraffin embedded tissues and reverse transcribed. To overcome the effect of
different degrees of RNA degradation due to variations in storage conditions
and duration of fixation, samples were analysed using GAPDH as a
housekeeping gene.
The TaqMan detection system exploits the 5'- 3' endonuclease activity of Taq
DNA polymerase which digests a double labelled internal fluorogenic probe
during the amplification reaction. Prior to PCR the intact probe fluorescence
of the reporter is suppressed by the quencher due to its spatial proximity.
Digestion of the probe by Taq DNA polymerase results in separation of
reporter and quencher dyes and a concomitant increase in fluorescence.
The fluorescent intensities obtained for TSHr and GAPDH were compared
and a relative TSHr index was calculated for each sample. Results indicate
the level of TSHr expression parallels the histologically graded degree of
differentiation in the tumours assayed. Thus TSHr expression may prove to
be an additional prognostic marker in thyroid carcinomas, and be of
therapeutic value.
P142 IN SlTUTRAP ASSAY FOR
LOCALISATION OF TELOMERASE
ACTIVITY IN TISSUE SECTIONS, MJ Thompson & MC Bibby. Clinical
Oncology Unit, University ofBradford, Bradford, West Yorkshire, BD7 lDP, UK
Telomerase is a riboprotein responsible for the maintenance of telomeric
regions at the ends ofeukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeric regions ofchromosome
are responsible for stabilisation of chromosome ends and the prevention of
apoptosis due to chromosome shortening during cell division. As such telomerase
is thought to be important in the immortalisation of cells, tumour formation and
the function of stem cells. An example of a proliferating cell system is the
seminiferous epithelium, a highly complex arrangement reliant upon stem cells to
produce large numbers ofhighly differentiated spermatozoa.
The standard telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay (TRAP)
clearly demonstrates high levels of telomerase activity within stem cell based
tissues such as the testis. Because any tissue has to be homogenised, the assay
cannot identify which cells within such a heterogenous tissue actually possess this
activity. The physical isolation of different cell populations, whilst giving some
cell specificity, remains an imperfect technique when faced with the wide variety
ofcell types present in many tissues such as the testis.
Using the adult mouse seminiferous epithelium as a model, this study
applies a novel adaptation ofthe standard TRAP assay to study telomerase activity
in cryosectioned tissue. This method enables RNase and heat sensitive telomerase
activity to be identified within individual cells of a tissue. The results demonstrate
that the nuclei of mitotic spermatogonia and meiotic spermatocytes express
telomerase activity. Surprisingly, the non-dividing, differentiating spermatids were
also found to possess similar activity, cleary located in the elonting spermatid
heads. The late spermatocytes, early spermatids and mature spermatozoa have
negligible telomerase activity.
This adaption of the TRAP assay is therefore a useful addition to the
standard methods ofdetermining telomerase activity and will allow us, for the first
time, to examine the pattern oftelomerase activity within tumour tissues.

P144 DOES THE ACIDIC DOMAIN OF THE MDM2
ONCOPROTEIN HAVE A TRANSCRIPTIONAL CONTROL
FUNCTION? Catherine Bladen*, John Lunec. Cancer Research unit, Medical
School, University ofNewcastle Upon Tyne, NE2 4HH.
The transforming properties ofthe MDM2 oncoprotein were originally attributed to
its ability to bind and inactivate the p53 tumour suppressor protein. More recent
studies have revealed that MDM2 has additional transforming mechanisms which
are independent ofthe p53 interaction. We have characterised alternatively spliced
forms of MDM2 which retain transforming ability in spite of losing p53 binding
domain sequences (Sigalas et al 1996, Nature Medicine, 2 (8) 912-17 ) and studies
with transgenic mice have shown that MDM2 is tumourigenic even in p53 null
mice (Lundgren et al 1997, Genes and Development, 11(6) 714-25 ). These
observations have led us to examine the role of alternative potential functions of
MDM2, particularly the possibility of a transcriptional regulatory function, as
suggested by the presence of zinc-finger motifs in the C-terminal region, including
a RING-finger domain, and a putative acidic transcriptional transactivation domain.
Here we describe the specific testing ofthe acidic domain ofMDM2 for the ability
to act as a transcriptional activation domain by fusing it to the DNA binding
domain ofa yeast Gal4 transcription factor and tested this hybrid (MDM2Ac-GaI4)
for transcriptional function in a luciferase reporter gene system where the luciferase
gene is driven by a Gal4 promoter.
A DNA fragment encoding the acidic domain of MDM2 (amino acids 223-274)
was isolated by PCR and cloning from MDM2 cDNA and then subcloned
downstream and in frame with the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain already present
in the PSG424 eukaryotic expression vector. Recombinant clones were identified
by PCR screening and confirmed by DNA sequencing. These constructs were then
co-transfected into NIH3T3 murine fibroblast cells together with the PGS-LUC
plasmid, containing a luciferase reporter gene under the control ofa Gal4 promoter,
and PoGal encoding P-galactosidase to assess transfection efficiency. Expression
of the luciferase gene resulting from transcriptional regulation by the MDM2Ac-
Gal4 fusion protein was assessed by measurement of luciferase activity using the
Dual Light' (Perkin-Elmer) chemiluminescence system and a luminometer to
quantify the light emission. Gal4-vpl6 was used as a positive control and the
PSG424 vector as a negative control. All transfections were carried out in
triplicate. The luciferase activity generated with the intact Gal4-vpl6 positive
control was 1914 +/-100 times the background level seen with the vector only
negative control, whereas the levels of activity obtained with the MDM2Ac-Gal4
fusion construct were not significantly different from the background; ratio 1:1.7.
These observations indicate that the acidic domain of MDM2 does not behave as a
positive transcriptional transactivation domain in this standard test system and do
not support a transcriptional role for the MDM2 oncoprotein.

CD40, a member of the TNF/NGF receptor superfamily, is expressed in normal
epithelial and B cells and a number of carcinomas. The interaction ofCD40 with its
cognate ligand, CD40L, regulates growth, survival and differentiation. The signalling
pathways which mediate these phenomena are however not well understood. We have
investigated the effects of CD40 ligation on the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade
in a number of epithelial carcinoma cell lines. Using in vitro kinase assays we have
demonstrated that JNK activation rapidly occurs in response to treatment with
recombinant soluble CD4OL (rsCD4OL). This phenomenon translates to induction of
AP-1, a transcription factor which is readily activated by growth factors and mitogens.
As the GI phase protein cyclin DI is known to be regulated by AP-1, we have
examined the effects of rsCD40L on cyclin DI expression. Using semi-quantitative
RT-PCR and western blot analysis, we have demonstrated a 3-4 fold induction of cyclin
Dl RNA and protein levels following CD40 ligation in serum-deprived carcinoma cell
lines. Futhermore, CD40 stimulation was found to induce hyperphosphorylation of the
retinoblastoma protein pRb. This effect was rapid but gradually declined over 24
hours. These data identify the cell growth-regulatory cyclin DI and pRb proteins as
targets of CD40 signalling.

Antibody directed enzyme prodrug therapy (ADEPT) involves a two step strategy designed to deliver
an enzyme to a tumour site, followed by the administration of a non-toxic prodrug. The prodrug is
activated by the enzyme specifically at the tumour and results in selective killing of tumour cells.
This system requires the enzyme to be delivered to viable tumour areas within a heterogeneous
tumour mass. The sub-millimetre distribution of a bacterially produced recombinant fusion protein of
MFE-23, an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) single chain Fv (scFv), fused to the enzyme
carboxypeptidase (CPG2)1 is presented.
Biodistribution of [1251]-MFE-23::CPG2 fusion protein and free [l12s]-cPG2 were studied in nude mice
bearing LS174T human colon adenocarcinoma xenografts. Percentage injected activity per gram of
tumour at 6, 24 and 48 h was 6%, 3% and 2.5%, respectively for the fusion protein and 5.5%, 0.6%
and 0.16% for free CPG2 The corresponding blood levels were 4%, 0.2% and 0.06% for the fusion
protein compared to 4.6%, 0.15% and 0.033% for free CPG2. This gave tumour to blood ratios of
1.6, 18 and 42:1 for the fusion protein and 1.3, 4 and 5:1 for free CPG2. These results indicate that
the recombinant MFE-23::CPG2 fusion protein has significantly higher tumour selectivity than the
free CPG2, while showing similar rapid plasma and normal tissue clearance. Successful ADEPT,
however, relies on matching the fusion protein localisation and accessability to viable tumour with
the pharmacokinetics of the prodrug employed.
To determine the optimal time for prodrug administration in relation to fusion protein localisation,
and to study the non-specific retention of free CPG2, autoradioluminography2 (phosphor storage
plate technology) was used to show the distribution within tumour and normal tissue. Preliminary
results show selective localisation of the fusion protein in viable tumour regions compared to free
CPG2 which is retained predominantly in necrotic areas. Further phosphor image studies to
determine the distribution at time points ranging from 1-72 h are in progress. The data generated
form this model system can contribute to the development of potential ADEPT fusion proteins and
refine prodrug scheduling.

P146 Should one exclude spontaneous regression before
starting biological therapy in renal cancer?

London EClA 7BE
Since 1978 164 RCC patients have been screened for entry into
clinical trials and entered onto surveillance as first management
policy until symptoms or serial radiology indicated tumour
progression. 3+4 (4%) have demonstrated unexplained
"spontaneous" CR+PR (median duration 17 mths), and 7(4%)
"stable" disease (median 28 mths). None of 19 not nephrectomised
regressed, while CR+PR was 11% of 40 nephrectomised at
diagnosis of metastasis, 1% of 76 developing metastases 1-17 mths
after nephrectomy and 10% of 29 developing metastases more than
I8mths after nephrectomy. It was 12% of 47 with lung only verses
1% of 117 other sites. Possible evidence for relief of potentially
immunosuppressive influences have been demonstrated in 4 of 7
patients demonstrating unexplained "spontaneous regression".
After progression on surveillance 114 patients have been entered
into treatment trials. Clinical evidence of response 35% v 12% was
higher in patients receiving cIFNAIL-2/5-FU (n=37) than other
studies (n=77). High responses were also seen in patients with lung
only as site of disease. Although these results suggest that no harm
has come from a period of preliminary surveillance, the fact that the
therapeutic benefits including durable complete remission from
therapy are confined almost entirely to the good risk small volume
asymptomatic patients makes it difficult to justify a policy of
surveillance in such patients.

operations for hepatic or pancreatic disease. R Gupta', K Patel', JN Primrose', CD Johnson',
P Yaqoob2, P Calder2, ' Dept. Surgery, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton S016
6YD, 2 Institute ofHuman Nutrition, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 7PX.
Background: Oxidative stress and septic complications are an integral part of
serious inflammatory conditions including serious sepsis and major blunt trauma.
Aggressive nutritional support in the form oftotal enteral nutrition (TEN) is known
to attenuate this phenomenon possibly by reducing translocation ofendotoxin or
micro-organisms from the gut lumen into the systemic circulation. There is a dearth
of such data in respect ofpatients recovering from major abdominal operations.
Aims : The aim ofour study was to investigate the effect of major abdominal
operations in terms ofoxidative stress and to ascertain ifearly enteral nutrition
would have a beneficial effect.
Methods: We measured lipid peroxidation as an index ofoxidative stress by
quantifying thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (ug/l) in the plasma of 37
patients undergoing hepatic or pancreatic operations for benign or malignant
disease. This was measured pre-operatively and again on day 3 and day 7 post-
operatively. Patients were randomised to receive no nutritional support or total
enteral nutrition immediately post-operatively. Our results are summarised in the
table below.
Results (ug/l)
Control 22 3.8 (2.8) 4.0 (1.8) 4.4 (2.1)
TEN 15 5.1 (4.6) 5.7 (4.5) 5.9 (3.0)
p 0.29 0.13 0.08
All values are mean (sd)
Conclusions Our results suggest that although TEN is safe and well tolerated in
post-operative hepatic and pancreatic patients there is no advantage in terms of
attenuation of oxidative stress.

Immunologic reconstitution following myeloablative chemotherapy and PBPC rescue
was studied by examining the regeneration ofthe T cell receptor beta chain (TCRBV)
repertoire in peripheral blood ofpatients. The TCRBV usage was analysed in twenty
three patients with solid maligancies, before cyclophosphamide priming and monthly
following high dose chemotherapy and PBPC rescue, using directly conjugated
monoclonal antibodies to TCRBV 2,3,5S2/5S3, 7.1, 8, 9, 17, 21 and 22. Expansions
of particular TCRBV families were found in four patients (TCRBV 3, 17, 21 and 22)
ranging from 8 - 42% of the CD4+ or CD8+ repertoire, which reappeared within two
months and were stable for up to eighteen months following PBPC rescue. The
expansions in three patients (TCRBV 3, 21, 22) were further characterised by
isolating CD4+ or CD8+ populations and sequencing the CDR3 portion of the gene
rearrangement following RTPCR amplication of mRNA. The expansions were
shown to be predominantly oligoclonal containing identical sequences before and
after myeloablative chemotherapy. This study demonstrates that patients undergoing
autologous PBPC rescue for high dose chemotherapy are able to regenerate a diverse
T cell repertoire, consistent with pre-treatment repertoires, which occurs within eight
weeks following rescue. Furthermore, that the overwhelmimg majority of T cells
present following rescue arise from mature lymphocytes.

Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are increasingly used for
haemopoietic reconstitution following myeloablative chemotherapy.
PBSC provide several advantages over bone marrow including more
rapid haemopoietic recovery and reduced infusion volume. Selection of
CD34-positive stem cells has the potential advantage ofreducing tumor
burden in the PBSC infusion. Clinical application of CD34+ cell
selection requires effective mobilisation and high efficiency
processing. We report our experience with CD34+ cell selection for
autologous transplantation using the Isolex 300i system (Baxter).
Patients with multiple myeloma (MM, n =3) were mobilised with
ifosfamide, epirubicin and etopiside (IVE + G-CSF). Patients with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=2), breast cancer (n= I) and Hodgkin's
disease (n=2) were mobilised with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF.
Peripheral blood stem cells were collected using the Baxter CS3000
leukapheresis system. A single leukapheresis contained sufficient cells
for CD34 selection in 5 of 8 patients. In 3 cases two PBSC harvests
were pooled prior to selection. Where necessary, cells were stored
overnight with autologous plasma in gas permeable Lifecell bags
(Baxter). Prior to selection, the median number of CD34+ cells was
8.0 x 106 /kg (range 2.6 -
25.4). The median percentage of CD34+
cells was 3.3% (range 1.5 -
9.4). Following selection, the median
number of CD34+ cells was 4.6 x 106/kg (range 1.7- 18.75). Median
CD34+ cell recovery was 61% (range 56-80%).The CD34+ cell
product had a median purity of 98.4% (range 95- 99.5%). Five
patients have been reinfused with CD34+ stem cells following high
dose chemotherapy. The median time to neutrophil count >0.5x109/ L
was 11 days (range 9- 13) and to platelet count >20 x 109/ L was 14
days (range 13-16).We conclude that in conjunction with improved
mobilisation protocols such as IVE in multiple myeloma, the Isolex
300i system is highly efficient forclinical-scale CD34+ cell selection
from a single apheresis product.
P150 TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA (TNFa) REGULATES
THE EXPRESSION OF CD44 IN HUMAN ASTROCYTOMAS IN VITRO. -Monaghan M.
Radotra B. McCormick D. Oncology Department, The Queens University Of Belfast,
University Floor, Belfast City Hospital Tower, Lisburn Road, Belfast. BT9 7AB.
Malignant astrocytomas are highly invasive tumours that rarely metastasize
outside the central nervous system. Their ability to invade surrounding brain
tissue leads to poor prognosis and mortality and is the main reason for
recurrence after surgery. The process of invasion involves cell adhesion
molecule-mediated interactions between tumour cells and components of
the ECM. Amongst the glycosaminoglycans of the ECM, hyaluronic acid
(HA) is known to be enriched in fetal brain tissue where it facilitates cellular
migration during embryogenesis. HA is also increased in brain tumour ECM.
The major cell surface receptor for HA is CD44 and eariier work in this
laboratory has shown that CD44-HA interactions play a significant role in
astrocytoma invasion in vitro. ( Radotra B. & McCormick D. J.
Pathol.181:434-438.1997). The expression of many cell surface receptors is
regulated by cytokines including TNFa which is known to be produced by
reactive astrocytes and astrocytoma cells.
The aim of this research is to examine the potential role of TNFcc in the
regulation of expression of CD44 at the mRNA and protein levels. In a study
of 20 glioma cell lines by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RTPCR), all expressed the standard form of CD44, in contrast to many non-
CNS tumours in which splice variants are expressed. The expression of
CD44 at the protein level was examined using flow cytometric analysis. In a
pilot study, six astrocytomas showed upregulation of CD44 after treatment
with 10ng/mi TNFca for 24 hours. This increased expression was correlated
with grade, with high grade astrocytomas showing the greatest increase.
Expression of CD44 mRNA was investigated using semi-quantitative
RTPCR. Amplification of CD44 was stopped in the logarithmic phase of the
PCR and GAPDH was included as an internal standard. TNFca has been
shown to regulate expression of CD44 mRNA in all astrocytoma cell lines
investigated.
In summary, the present investigation has demonstrated that TNFaX
modulates transcription and translation of CD44 in human astrocytomas in
vitro.
P152 DNA TESTING PROVIDES PREDICTIVE DATA IN
THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE APLASTIC
ANAEMIA TRANSPLANT PATIENTS Lawler M*., Gardiner N., Gowing H.,
McCann SR. Dept Hematology, St James's Hospital/ Trinity College Dublin Ireland
Bone Marrow Transplantation(BMT) is an effective therapeutic option for Severe
Aplastic Anemia(SAA). However risk of graft failure/rejection ranges from 10-50%
depending on factors including patient population, degree of histocompatibility
match and conditioning therapy pre BMT. We have investigated the use of
polymorphic DNA markers as early indicators of graft rejection. Initially 91
patients were studied for chimeric status following allogeneic BMT for SAA. A
highly sensitive assay system using the polymerase chain reaction of short tandem
repeats(STR-PCR) allowed precise monitoring of the evolution of hemopoietic
chimerism. Informative polymorphisms were identified in all cases and used to
assess chimerism in post transplant bone marrow and peripheral blood samples
serially(3-15 samples per patient). STR-PCR indicated (A) complete donor chimeras
(n=40), (B) transient mixed chimeras (n = 16) (C) stable mixed chimeras (n=18), (D)
progressive mixed chimeras(n=17). In group A only donor cells were detected at all
timepoints post BMT; there was only one case of poor graft function(2%) and 4
deaths in total(10%). In group B, recipient cells could bie detected transiently, with
re-establishment of donor hemopoiesis occuring up to day 327 post BMT; early
graft failure was documented in one patient(6%) and 3 deaths(19%) occurred. Group
C patients exhibited persistent and stable low levels of recipient cells(<15%); there
were no episodes of graft failure/rejection and 1 death(5.5%) in this group. Group D
showed high and/or progressive increases in recipient cells(>20%); in this group
there were 13(76%) early or late graft failures/rejections and 9 deaths(53%). We
analysed the following factors for association with mixed hemopoietic chimerism:
age, sex match, donor type, etiology of the aplasia, number of cells engrafted,
conditioning regimen, GvHD prophylaxis, occurrence of acute and chronic GvHD
and survival. Progressive mixed chimeras were at high risk of early or late graft
failure(n = 13, p= 0.0001). 7/13 patients lost their graft during withdrawal of
immunosuppressive therapy. Progressive mixed chimerism was a bad prognostic
indicator of survival(p = 0.003). These results have prompted prospective
monitoring of chimeric status during immunosuppression withdrawal. Currently
18 patients are enrolled in a prospective study where dynabead PCR is also
performed on separated hemopoietic lineages in an effort to identify which lineages
may provide an indication of impending graft failure. Thus DNA testing can
facilitate therapeutic intervention to prevent graft failure in patients transplanted for
Severe Aplastic Anemia.

P153 EXPRESSION OF CD44 mRNA IN NORMAL AS
WELL AS TUMOUR COLORECTAL TISSUE, M. Morrin and
P.V. DelaneyColorectal Research Unit, Limerick
Regional Hospital and University of Limerick.
Some of the variants of the CD44 cell adhesion
molecule have been implicated in tumour
metastasis formation, primarily CD44v6, but a
lack of concensus has emerged in the more recent
literature regarding the prognostic significance
of CD44 variant expression.In this study the
expression of CD44 variants at the mRNA level
using RT-PCR was investigated to gain greater
understanding of their role in metastasis.
Total RNA was isolated from a panel of colorectal
tumour cell lines and from a series of
normal/tumour tissue pairs, reverse transcribed
and PCR amplified using primers from the constant
region of the CD44 gene. This was then used as
template for a series of "exon-specific" PCR
reactions to analyse CD44 variant expression
patterns. The PCR products were further
investigated by Southern blotting and
hybridisation with variant specific probes.
A complex and diverse array of CD44 mRNA
transcripts was observed. 80% of the tumour:
normal pairs demonstrated variant expression,
although the transcripts were generally not as
strongly expressed in the normal tissue. A
sequential pattern of expression of the full
range of variants was common. The CD44v6 epitope
was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in
normal crypt base epithelia.The frequent
expression of multiple CD44 mRNA transcripts in
normal colorectal tissue suggests either a
difference in translational mechanisms of these
transcipts between normal and tumour tissue or
alternatively a lack of significance in tumour
development.

The aim ofthe study was to identity prognostically significant
proteins in a group of63 tumour samples taken from 59 patients
having eneucleations for large choroidal melanomas. Tumour from
four patients included areas with different clinical morphology (e.g.
amelanotic vs. pigmented). McAb expression and DNA ploidy was
measured by flow cytometry and correlated to clinical parameters
(sex, age ofthe patient, tumour location (cilliary body vs. choroidal),
cell type (spindle vs.mixed or epitheliod), tumour volume (<1500 mm
vs. > 1500mm) and the presence ofmetastatic spread); using
one-way-analysis ofvariance.
Cerb-B2 and C-myc expression showed association with cell type
suggesting differences in cell cycle control between them. Cerb-B2
was found in greater amounts in spindle cell tumours (n=19) than
mixed/epitheliod tumours (n=27). Mean /Rank 28.87/19.72 P-
0.023. C-myc was also expressed more by spindle cell tumours.
Mean/Rank 21.65/13.31 P- 0.017 (n= 10 spindle, 21 mixed/epith.).
A correlation was also found between tumour volume (as measured
by B-scan ultrasound measurements ) and ICAM expression with
greater expression in large tumours. Mean/Rank 18.37/ 27.84
P=0.016 (n= 23 < 1500mm, 22 > 1500mm). Metastatic disease was
only present in 11 patients and no correlation was found between this
and any ofthe surface markers.

MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY IN COLORECTAL CANCER, E.Nazem*',

Hospital, Leeds LS9 7TF, 3Molecular Pathology, Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds LS2 9JT.
The majority of Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) and
approximately 15% of sporadic bowel tumours have been found to exhibit
Microsatellite Instability (MI) - the observation of novel alleles in tumour cells at loci
throughout the genome. The MI phenotype results from defective repair of errors
arising in the DNA strands during replication. Repetitive sequences, eg. (A)n and
(CA)n repeats, are particularly susceptible to such errors because of DNA polymerase
";slippage". The mismatch repair proteins, eg. hMLHI and hMSH2 (human
homologues of the bacterial MutL and MutS mismatch repair proteins), are involved in
the recognition and correction of these errors and in HNPCC families and MI-positive
tumours the genes encoding them are often found to contain pathogenic mutations.
There has been much debate over which microsatellite markers are able to detect MI-
positive tumours most reliably and efficiently. Potential HNPCC families may be
identified in this way, enabling at risk relatives to be screened for bowel cancer and
other HNPCC-related cancers. Also MI-positive sporadic tumours may be a clinically
distinct group with a better response to therapy. Therefore, establishing the MI status
of a colorectal cancer is important.
We have compared the MI-detecting abilities of microsatellite markers within or near
to three "classic" tumour suppressor genes (APC, p53 and DCC) with two markers
containing poly-A tracts (BAT-26 and BAT-RII), by PCR and fluorescent gel
electrophoresis of 52 cases of sporadic bowel cancer. BAT-26 contains a run of 26
adenosines and is located within intron 5 of the hMSH2 gene - one of the genes often
found mutated in MI-positive tumours - and BAT-RII contains a run of 10 adenosines
and lies within the TGF-,B Receptor Type II tumour suppressor gene. Our results show
that 7/52 (13.5%) cases were identified as MI-positive by at least one of the three
tumour suppressor markers, while BAT-26 and BAT-RII both detected instability in
8/52 (15.4%) cases. A potential benefit of the APC, p53 and DCC tumour suppressor
gene markers is that, as well as MI, they can also detect loss of heterozygosity - a
frequent mechanism of inactivation of these genes in sporadic tumour progression.
However, BAT-26 may have a greater advantage as it appears to be almost
monomorphic in the wild-type and MI-positive tumours always seem to display alleles
corresponding to a loss of at least 4 adenosines in the 26-adenosine run found in
normal tissue. This could possibly eliminate a necd for normal uninvolved tissue for
comparison of allele lengths, making instability detection quicker and easier.

NEUROBLASTOMA USING COMPARATIVE GENOMIC
HYBRIDIZATION (CGH) C.J. Breen*, A. O'Meara and R.L. Stallings,
Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin 12, Ireland
Neuroblastoma is the commonest extracranial solid tumour of
childhood, with a peak incidence in the two to five year age group.
Despite intensive approaches to treatment, prognosis for most patients
remains poor. A number of chromosomal and molecular genetic
abnormalities (lp deletion, NMYC amplification, partial 17q trisomy)
have been associated with aggressive clinical behaviour, identification
of which are currently being incorporated into treatment strategies. The
recent application of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
technology has facilitated retrospective analysis of a wide range of
tumours with the added advantage of the visualization ofthe entire
genome. The aim of this study was to correlate the above abnormalities
with clinical behaviour and assess feasibility of incorporation of this
technology into prospective studies. Freshly cryopreserved tumour and/or
infiltrated bone marrow were investigated from 14 patients (ranging in age
from 3 weeks to 6yrs 4mths) attending the Oncology Dept. at this institution.
There were four patients with stage 2 disease, four with stage 3, five with
stage 4 and one infant with 4S disease. CGH enabeled clinically significant
genetic abnormalities to be detected in 11 out of the 14 tumours, and was
less cumbersome than conventional cytogenetics and obviated the need for
Southern blotting. While follow up period for some patients is short, adverse
genomic alterations such as NMYC amplification, partial trisomy 17q, and lp
deletion, were common in patients with advanced disease while hyperdiploidy
was noted in patients with low risk disease. The significance of additional
abnormalities detected in these tumours requires further study. These studies
expand upon the total number of neuroblastomas analysed by CGH by others
(e.g. Lastowska et al., 1997 Genes, Chr. Can. 18:162).

of Neurology, Queen Square, London WC1N 3BG
Astrocytic tumours are the most conmmno central nervous system tumour in
children and approximately a quarter of these are malignant. Although
these childhood turnours closely resemble their adult counterparts both, in
location and histological appearance, there is evidence that their
pathogenesis is genetically different. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic
analyses of paediatric astrocytoma have been unable to detect the genetic
changes which are characteristic in the adult tumours. Furthermore, loss
of heterozygosity at 17pl3.3 and 22q12 are the only novel non-random
aberrations to have been described in the paediatric tumours.
We have used comparative genomic hybridisation to identify gain and
loss of genetic material across the whole genome in a series of ten
paediatric malignant astrocytoma. DNA was extracted from either
freshly frozen tumour biopsies (7 cases) or 5p±m paraffin embedded sections
(3 cases) prior to differential labelling and hybridisation. We have
identified gene amplification at lpll-31, 2q21-24, 7p12, 7q21-32, 8p2l.3-
24.1, 12q13-pter and 13ql1.2 and genetic loss at 6p21.2-21.3, 6q15-16, 9p21,
9q12-21, lOpl3-15, 12q24.1-ter, 15q21-22, 17p13 and 22q12. Some of these
changes correspond to regions to which some adult astrocytoma oncogenes
and tumour suppressor genes are known to map; the regions of
amplification can chromosome 7 contain the EGFR and MET genes which
have been shown to be independently amplified in adult tumours, the
large amplicon on 12 contains the CDK4 and MDM2 genes which map to
12q13; the CDKN2/pl6 gene, which is homozygously deleted in 70% of
adult glioblastoma, is located at 9p21; and loss at 10pl3-15 corresponds
with the location of one of the putative tumour suppressor genes an
chromosome 10. It is possible, therefore, that there are some coumnan
genetic steps in the malignant progression of both paediatric and adult
astrocytoma.

The MDM2 proto-oncogene, which encodes a protein binding the p53
tumour suppressor, has been found amplified, overexpressed and in some
cases alternatively spliced in a range of human tumours. Although human
MDM2 cDNA sequence has been reported, the genomic sequence and
organisation have not been documented. Since MDM2 has demonstrated a
complex pattern of expression, including altemative splicing and differing
transcriptional start sites, a genomic sequence map becomes essential to
deciphering this gene's function. To this end, we amplified genomic DNA
using long range PCR techniques with primers based on the known cDNA
sequence. Genomic PCR products spanning introns were cloned into the
pUAg vector (Ingenius) and sequenced by automated and manual
methods.
We have now obtained complete PCR products and boundary sequences
for all introns. Our data shows that the MDM2 gene spans approximately 32
kb and is divided into a minimum of 12 exons. Exon sizes range from 71 to
greater than 1159 bp. Intron sizes vary from 121 to 7000 bp. All the splice
donor and acceptor sites follow the "GT-AG" rule. Comparison with the
murine genomic map data indicates sustantial differences in the size of
corresponding introns. In addition, exon/intron boundary sequences have
disclosed that the variant transcript forms of MDM2 gene reported
previously by Sigalas, et al (Nature Medicine 1996 2: 912-917) are
generated by alternative splicing mechanisms. The sequence map has also
revealed a promoter-like region in the near 3' end of intron 3 and has led
to the investigation of this as a second putative p53-dependent promoter.
P158 AN INVESTIGATION OF MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY IN
SPECIALISMD INTESTINAL METAPLASIA AT THE GASTRO-
OESOPHAGEAL JUNCTION, C.M. Gleeson*', N.I. McDougall2, J.M. Sloan3, J.S.A. Collins2,

2Gastroenterology and 3Pathology, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, N Ireland.
Introduction: Short segments of specialized intestinal metaplasia (SIM) at the
gastro-oesophageal junction have been reported in association with oesophageal
adenocarcinoma, but the malignant potential of SIM is unknown. Microsatellite
instability has been detected in oesophageal adenocarcinoma (Gleeson et al.,
Cancer Research, 1996, 56:259) and in associated Barrett's oesophagus
(Gleeson et al., Genes, Chromosomes & Cancer, 1998, 21:49). This study
assessed whether such changes occur in SIM at the gastro-oesophageal junction.
Methods: Patients attending randomly selected open access upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy lists were invited to participate in the study. Paired
biopsies were taken from the gastric body and from the epithelium immediately
distal to the squamocolumnar junction. Samples were assessed for evidence of
SIM using H&E and PAS/AB staining of tissue sections. Frozen samples
demonstrating SIM were assessed for microsatellite instability.
Results: One hundred and one patients were recruited to the study. In six cases,
the biopsy samples contained squamous epithelium and the remaining 95 cases
(44 males, 51 females; mean age of 47 years, range 20-87 years) were assessed
for SIM. Sixty patients had a normal oesophagus on endoscopy, 11 had hiatus
hernia alone, 20 had oesophagitis or oesophageal ulcer, 2 had Barrett's
oesophagus and 2 were not available. SIM was detected in 20 patients (21%),
two of whom had Barrett's oesophagus on endoscopic assessment and one who
had intra-mucosal carcinoma not detected at endoscopy. In 8 of these 20 cases,
the frozen sections did not show any evidence of SIM and a further two
specimens were not available for genetic analysis. Microsatellite instability was
detected in the 2 cases with Barrett's oesophagus. None of the remaining 7
patients with SIM, but normal junctional mucosa, had microsatellite instability.
Conclusions: The incidence of SIM at the gastro-oesophageal junction in
randomly selected patients attending our open access centre is similar to that
reported previously. The occurrence of SIM is patchy, as demonstrated by the
disparity between the parafm and the frozen sections. Finally, we have found
evidence of microsatellite instability in patients with Barrett's oesophagus, but
not in those with SIM at the gastro-oesophageal junction.

P160 EXPRESSION OF P53, WAF-1, BCL-2, AND BAX IN
CENTRAL PRIMITIVE NEUROECTODERMAL TUMOURS
(cPNET), A.S.Y.W.Burns*', E. Jaros', A.D.J.Pearson', R.H. Perry2 and J. Lunec', 'Cancer Research
Unit, University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, 'Neuropathology, Newcastle General Hospital
We have previously found that strong p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC)
staining intensity correlates with poorer patient survival for cPNETs (Jaros
et al, BJC, 68, 801-807, 1993). Subsequent analysis of a group of 96
cPNET's has shown that there is a strong association between overall
staining intensity and the percentage of stained tumour cells (labelling
index, or LI). LI of >20% correlated with poorer survival (p= 0.0165, log-
rank test). However, dideoxy-DNA sequencing of the p53 gene (exons 4-8)
identified point mutations in only 2/8 cases from the intensely staining
group and not in the moderate and negative groups, indicating that p53
point mutations are not frequent in these tumours. The potential of p53
function as a prognostic marker in cPNETs was further explored by IHC
staining for downstream protein mediators of p53 functions; p2 l/Waf- 1,
Bc1-2 and Bax expression was examined using corresponding antibodies,
monoclonals Ab-l(Oncogene-Science) and 124 (Dako), and polyclonal
13666E (Pharmingen). p21/Wafl was weakly expressed (<5%LI), whereas
bax was strongly (>40%) expressed in 69% of the tumours, with LI
distributed in a distinct bimodal pattern. Bc1-2 was expressed in only 38%
of the cases (LI >0 to 95%). Survival did not correlate with p2l/Waf-l
expression (p=0.7195). Although higher Bax- or Bc1-2 expression showed a
trend for association with poorer survival, this did not reach statistical
significance (p=0.1574 and 0.1268, respectively). This might indicate some
de-regulation in the Bax downstream pathway. In addition, no correlation
was found between p53 overexpression and the expression of these
proteins. In conclusion, pre-treatment analysis for these downstream
mediators ofp53 function did not provide additional prognostic information
to analysis of p53 status alone, the significance of which was confirmed in
these extended studies.

P161 IN OF THE
FHIT GENE INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF
DIFFERENT CLONES IN SQUAMOUS CERVICAL CANCER, D. Butler*,
E.W. Kay, C. Barry Walsh & M. Leader. Dept. of Pathology, Royal College of
Surgeons in Ireland, St. Stephen's Green, Dublin 2.
Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH) analysis has revealed a predominance of
deletions on the short arm of chromosome 3 in cervical cancers between
3pl3 and 3p21.1. It has been postulated that a novel tumour suppressor
gene may be located in this region. In 1996 a candidate tumour
suppressor gene was discovered at 3p14.2 called the FHIT tumour
suppressor gene. The FHIT gene also encompasses the common
chromosomal fragile site FRA3B. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) which is
the main aetiological agent in cervical cancers has been found to be able to
integrate its genes into the chromosome 3 fragile site deleting a piece of
DNA induding the EHiT gene. The close association between LOH on
chromosome 3, FRA3B disruption and viral integration by HPV makes
theFHIT gene an ideal candidate in the tumourgenesis of cervical cancer.
Sixty three cervical LLETZ biopsy specimens were selected from a
computerised database of cases in the Pathology Department, R.C.S.I.
Tumour and normal cells were microdissected from a total of sixty three
cases of preinvasive and microinvasive squamous lesions which
comprised 21 CIN1 cases, 24 CIN3 cases and 18 microinvasive cases.
CIN3 tdmour cells associated with 18 microinvasive cases were also
dissected for comparative analysis. DNA was extracted using single step
proteinase K digestion. PCR was used to amplify the target area using a
fluorescently labelled intragenic microsatellite marker. PCR products were
analysed on an automated DNA sequencer using Fragment Manager
software to determine allele loss.
Analysis of allele ratios, to determine the degree of allele loss, revealed
variable degrees of reduction in allele ratios in tumour versus normal cells.
CIN1 lesions showed the lowest percentage of reduction in allele ratios
followed by the CIN3 cases and microinvasive associated CIN3 cases.
The microinvasive cells had the highest percentage of reduction.
The purity of tumour cells obtained by microdissection indicates the
existence of different clones within the same population of tumour cells.
Determination of the experimental variation between normal and tumour
pairs, may allow the calculation of a cut off point below which LOH can
be confirmed. The cause of this phenomenon has yet to be determined but
may be related to viral integration events.
P163 HISTOLOGICAL
EXPRESSION OF c-erbB-2 ONCOPROTEIN IN
CERVICAL CANCER GRADES, D. Butler*, E.W. Kay, C. Barry Walsh & M.
Leader. Dept. of Pathology, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, St. Stephen's
Green, Dublin 2.
The c-erbB-2 proto-oncogene encodes a 185Kd transmembrane
glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity and which shows 78%
homology with the intracytoplasmic domain of EGFR receptor.
Amplification and overexpression of c-erbB-2 has been reported in a
variety of tumours predominantly of epithelial origin such as breast,
ovary, pancreas and stomach. Membrane staining for c-erbB-2 has been
found to be prognostically significant. Few studies have assessed the role
of c-erbB-2 overexpression in preinvasive and invasive squamous cervical
lesions and none in relation to poor histological features.
83 archival cervical LLETZ biopsies consisting of 27 CIN1 cases, 30 CIN3
cases and 26 microinvasive cases were selected consecutively from a
computerised database of cases in the Pathology Department, R.C.S.I.
Immunostaining for c-erbB-2 oncoprotein overexpression was performed
using an indirect ABC technique on sections 3pm thick. Staining was
evaluated for intensity and extent for both cytoplasmic and membrane
staining in the CIN1, CIN3 and microinvasive cases.
Haematoxylin and Eosin stained sections from the 83 cases were
reviewed for the presence of 6 histological features some of which have
been previously shown to be associated with microinvasive cancer
namely: extent of surface involvement, extent of glandular involvement,
comedo necrosis, squamous maturation, koilocytic change and apoptosis.
Univariate and bivariate analysis was used to determine the relationship
between overexpression of c-erbB-2 and the presence of adverse
histological features.
Membraneous staining for c-erbB-2 oncoprotein was absent in all grades
of lesion. Cytoplasmic staining intensity was shown to have a statistical
relationship with koilocytic change. All of the histological features
examined were shown to have a strong statistical relationship with grade
af tumour.
Immunostaining for c-erbB-2 in cervical biopsies may prove to be a useful
adjunct to screening detected lesions in association with the recording of
certain histological parameters, although the biological significance of
cytoplasnmic c-erbB-2 overexpression is unknown.

Paraffin wax-processed tissue samples from forty cases of
cervical adenocarcinoma, 20 each from Swedish and Irish hospital
laboratories. These samples were evaluated for HPV status by PCR
amplification (with two sets of HPV consensus primers), proliferative
status (cyclin A and polyclonal Ki-67 antibodies ), p53 protein (p53-DO7
monoclonal antibody) and oestrogen receptor (ID5 monoclonal antibody)
expression by immunohistochemistry.
The average paietent age was 44 for the Irish and 61 for the
Swedish adenocarcinoma cases. The majority of Irish tumours were HPV-
positive while some of the Swedish turnours from the older patients were
HPV-negative. These negatives are being further evaluated with type-
specific probes. p53-DO7 immunostaining was performed without
superheating and one Irish and two Swedish samples expressed high
levels of protein (>40% of tumour cells) and five Swedish samples low
levels (<10%). Most HPV-negative cases were p53 protein positive.
None of the Irish samples were oestrogen receptor positive
although stromal cells were immunopositive in some samples. 63% ofthe
Swedish turnours were high expressors with >50% of tumour cells
immunostaining.
No differential was discerned between Swedish and Irish samples
for Ki-67 and cyclin A protein expression. The average Ki-67 and cyclin
A proliferative indices for Irish turnours was 44% and 25% respectively
while for the Swedish turnours values were 47% and 23%.

Following the recent discovery of the putative tumour suppressor gene,
PTENIMMACJITEPI, on chromosome 10q23 by mapping of homozygous deletions in
tumour cell lines (Li et al, Science, 275: 1943, 1997; Steck et al, Nature Genetics, 15:
356, 1997; Li et al, Cancer Research, 57: 2124, 1997), a number of studies have
examined the frequency of somatic mutations in this gene. Somatic mutations have been
found in glioblastomas, melanomas and breast and prostate carcinomas. Germline
mutations in PTEN have been found in Cowden disease families (Liaw et al, Nature
Genetics, 16: 64, 1997), Bannayan-Zonana syndrome families (Marsh et al, Nature
Genetics, 16: 333, 1997) and also some Juvenile Polyposis families (Lynch et al,
American Journal of Human Genetics, 61: 1254, 1997).
We hypothesise that germline PTEN mutations could be important in familial prostate
cancer. We have therefore searched the CRC/BPG UK Familial Prostate Cancer Study
samples for evidence of PTEN mutations. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood taken
from 50 prostate cancer families chosen because they contained three or more cases of
prostate cancer or related sibling pairs, preferably where one was less than 65 years at
diagnosis. First the samples were genotyped at three loci close to PTENV and LOD scores
calculated to identify families consistent with linkage. Overall there was significant
evidence against the hypothesis that familial prostate cancer is due to PTEN. Under the
best fitting model, a quarter 6f families were due to a gene in the PTEN region but the
statistical evidence for any linkage was minimal. DNA from the youngest affected male
from each of the 37 remaining families was then amplified by PCR and each of the 9 P7EN
exons sequenced in both directions. To date no mutations have been found.

Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor a (PPARa) is a member of the nuclear
receptor superfamily of ligand activated transcription factors. PPARa is activated bs
peroxisome proliferators and faty acids and has been shown to be involved in the
transcriptional regulation of genes involved in faty acid metabolism. In rodents the
PPARa-mediated change in such genes results in peroxisome proliferation and can
lead to the induction of hepatocarcinogenesis.
In humans PPARa is expressed at high levels in liver, heart and kidney and at lower
levels in other tissues. Using the mRNA differential display technique we have
shown that chronic exposure of the prostate cancer epithelial cell line LNCaP to the
synthetic androgen mibolerone results in the downregulation of PPARa mRNA.
Northern blot analysis confirmed that PPARa mRNA levels are reduced to
approximately 40%o of control levels in LNCaP cells exposed to I OnM mibolerone
for 96 hours.
In situ hybridisation analysis showed that PPARa expression in prostate is confined
to epithelial cells and is upregulated in prostatic carcinoma. In benign prostatic
tissue PPARa mRNA was either absent or weakly expressed in the basal epithelial
cells whereas in high grade prostatic carcinoma there was strong expression in
tumour cells.
These results suggest that PPARa may play a role in the development and
progression of prostatic carcinoma.

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 1Oq22-23 has been identified in a
significant proportion of invasive bladder turnours (Cappellin et al.,
Oncogene, 14: 3059, 1997). Recently, the PTEN/MMAClgene
was identified as a candidate turnour suppressor within this region.
Mutations of PTEN have been found in several other turnour types
including glioblastornas, carcinomas of prostate, breast
endornetrium and melanoma. We have carried out LOH analysis of
10q and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis
of PTEN to determine its potential involvement in bladder cancer.
We assessed 63 invasive (.pT2) and 61 superficial (pTa/Ti)
transitional cell carcinomas for LOH at three microsatellite ioci
(DlOS541, D1OS215, DlOS1765) cose to PTEN. LOH/allelic
imbalance was found in 17/49 informative invasive tumours and
4/61 superficial tumours indicating a significant association of 1Oq
LOH with disease progression. Primers were designed to amplify
the entire coding region of PTEN in fragments of <320bp and
SSCP analysis was carried out on genomic DNA from 63 invasive
tumours including all 17 with LOH/alielic imbalance. Band mobility
shifts were identified in 13 tumours. Three of these in exon 1
appear to be normal sequence polymorphisms. Sequencing of
the other suspected mutations is in progress.

The putatire tumour-suppressor gene PTEN. located on chromosome l0q22-23. h;
been found to be involved in several different tpes of cancer including brain, breast
endometrial and prostate. It has also been implicated in bladder cancer (see abstract bN
Ayevard and Knowles).
The function of PTEN is yet to be fully deternined, although it has extensise
homology with tensin and auxillin (cytoskeletal proteins involsed in cell motilitrs
and also possesses a functional dual-specificity tyTosine phosphatase region. It ha
been postulated that this may proVide PTEN with its tumour suppressor function
counteracting an oncogenic kinase. The purpose of this current study is to assess tfa
status of PTEN in bladder cancer cell lines and to explore its function by gent
replacement experiments.
Duplex PCR reactions have shown one cell line. IM-UC-3. to have a homozygou-i
deletion of the entire PTEN gene Subsequent analysis by Western blotting hX
confirmed that this cell line produces no PTEN protein. A panel of 16 bladder cel.
lines is currently being screened for mutations using SSCP analysis.
The lack of a functional PTEN protein in LTM-UC-3 cells makes it a good candida
for transfection with an exogenous PTEN gene. Initial transfections with a constrt%
containing the entire PTEN cDNA in the mammalian expression sector. pcDNA3
are in progress Similar constructs under control of inducible promoters are planned.

P169 IDENTIFICATION AND METHYLATION BASED SILENCING
OF A GENE(DBCCR1 )
WITHIN A CANDIDATE BLADDER
TUMOUR SUPPRESSOR REGION AT 9q32-33 T. Habuchi, J. Coulter and M.A.
Knowles, ICRF Cancer Medicine Research Unit, St James's University Hospital,
Beckett St, Leeds, LS9 7TF.
Introduction: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 9q is the most
frequent genetic alteration in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder,
indicating the presence of one or more relevant tumour suppressor genes. We
have mapped one of these to 9q32-33 and localised the candidate region
within a single 840kb YAC (Habuchi, T., Yoshida, 0. and Knowles, M.A. Hum
Mol Genet 6: 913, 1997)
Methods: We isolated cDNA clones for ESTs mapped to the critical YAC
852el 1 and carried out 5' RACE to ensure that full length cDNA sequence was
obtained. Inton-exon boundaries were identified by vectorette PCR. Single
strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used to screen for
mutations. Methylation analysis of 2 BssHII sites was carried out by Southern
blotting. To assess the role of methylation in gene silencing, cultured cells
were treated with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine for 4 days
before RNA extraction for RT-PCR analysis.
Results: The critical region of deletion is contained within the YAC clone
852el 1 which is predicted to contain a bladder tumour suppressor gene
designated DBC1 (for Deleted in Bladder Cancer gene 1). Two ESTs mapped
to this YAC were examined. Clones for one of these contained no open
reading frame and 5'RACE did not extend the sequence into an open reading
frame. The second, IB3089, identifed a human foetal brain cDNA clone with an
insert of 1 706bp containing an open reading frame with a predicted product of
761 amino acids. This gene has been designated DBCCR1 (Deleted in Bladder
Cancer Chromosome Region candidate 1) and shows no DNA or protein
sequence homology with known genes or domains. Mutation analysis
detected no mutations in bladder tumour DNAs. Although the gene was
expressed in multiple human tissues including urothelium, mRNA expression
was absent in 5 of 10 bladder cancer cell lines. Methylation analysis of the
CpG island at the 5' region of the gene and the induction of de novo
expression by a demethylating agent indicated that this island is a frequent
target for hypermethylation in bladder cancer.
Conclusions: A novel geneDBCCR1 has been identified within a critical region
of deletion in bladder cancer at 9q32-33. Although no somatic mutations have
been detected in bladder tumours, gene silencing by hypermethylation in both
bladder turnours and cell lines makes this a good candidate for DBC1.

P170 DELETIONS AT 9q34 IN BLADDER CANCER INVOLVE
THE TSC1 LOCUS 'N.J. Homigold, *A. Davies
and M. A. Knowles, ICRF Cancer Medicine Research Unit, St James's
University Hospital, Beckett St, Leeds, LS9 7TF.
Introduction: Deletions of chromosome 9 occur in the majority (>50%)
of human bladder cancers. There is now evidence that loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) involves at least 3 regions on 9q suggesting
that multiple chromosome 9 tumour suppressor genes may contribute
to the development of bladder cancer.
Methods: We have used microsatellite based deletion mapping to
pinpoint the critical region of LOH at 9q34. Single strand conformation
polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was used to screen for mutations in the
TSC1 gene followed by direct sequencing of bands with altered
mobility.
Results :LOH analysis at 17 microsatellite loci in 9q34 in a panel of 102
bladder tumours identified 6 tumours with small deletions involving
9q34 only. The minimum region was between the loci D9S149 and
D9S66. This region contains the tuberous sclerosis gene TSC1.
TSC1 is predicted to act as a tumour suppressor gene since deletion
of the wild type allele is detected in hamartomas which develop in
individuals carrying a germline mutation. TSC1 is therefore a
candidate 9q34 bladder tumour suppressor. We have carried out a
mutation screen of TSC1 in the 6 tumours with discrete 9q34
deletions and in 31 tumours with LOH of the entire chromosome arm.
Primers flanking TSC1 exons were used to amplify the entire coding
sequence in 19 fragments for analysis. Several bands with altered
mobility have been identified in bladder tumour DNA. Sequencing of
these is in progress.
Conclusions: A critical region of LOH has been mapped to 9q34 in
bladder cancer. This region contains the recently identified TSC1
gene, a putative tumour suppressor. Preliminary SSCP analyses
indicate that some bladder tumours contain somatic alterations to
TSC1. The nature of these awaits confirmation by DNA sequencing.

Bladder cancer is a common clinical problem accounting for appro\Imatelv
000 deaths per annum in the L.K.. Diagnosis and folloss up rels heavily
on cystoscopx and biopsy, an invasive procedure performed under general
anaesthetic. The advent of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) based
technologies opens up possibilities for the des'elopment of sensitive
assays to test for abnormal cancer-derived genetic material. These max be
used on samples obtained by less invasive techniques.
W\e have demonstrated previously, using cancer cell lines, that under
optimal conditions, Sinole Stranded Conformatio~nal Pols mr hism
(SSCP) is capable of detecting a mutation in the p53 gene when mutation
carr ing cells comprise betwveen and 5', ot the sample (Phillips hIA. et
al., 1996, Br Cancer, 73, suppl XXVI, 4;).
In this studs we e\amined the feasibility of uising p;3 mntitations (the most
common somatic genetic aberrations in bladder cancer) as a marker tor the
presence of malignancs in bladder ssash specimens.
lt\ \ e\tracted from 31 bladder wash samples from 21' patients with

SSC P pattern ss as detected in samples of the tumour obtained by surgical

technical difficulties but the same abnormal SSCP pattern was apparent

Altered expression of several gene products has been associated with multidrug resistance
(MDR) 'in cancer. We have previously suggested that a monoclonal antibodY (MAb), PIHlO1
raised to the ovarian cancer cell line, OAW42, may be detecting an antigen with a possibIy
role in MDR[II The antigen. with a molecular mass of 48 kDa identified by Westei*
Blotting, was differentially expressed in selected carcinoma cell lines but was not detected by
enzyme-linked 'ismnunoabsorbent assav and u'nrsunocvtochemical studies in the normal fresh
or frozen matenal investigated[ I
In the present study. the distribution of the antigen recognised bv the antibodv PlH10 in
range of routinely hixed parafftin wax-embedded tissue samples of 23 ovarian and 46 breast
tissue samples was investigated by uimunohistochemistrs. Of the ovarian samples, there wain
no staining in 3 normal or 10 benign (4 serous/6 mucinous) tissue sections. Strong positive
staining which was confined to the corpus luteum was detected in I out of 4 borderline
mucinous tuinours. No staining, however, has been detected in normal corpus luteum. I out
of 6 epithelial tumours showed intense staining with MAb P1H10. This tumour was
histologically charactensed as a poorly differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the
ovars w'ith clear cell change and advanced metastates. There ssas histiocvtic uinunoreactivity
in some ofi the turnours.
The matonts of the normal breast tissue sections (17 out of 20) had negative staining oil
immunohistochemiucal analysis wVith MAb P11310. Staining on the remaining sections only
occurred in macrophages and in isolated ducts associated with possible apocmne change. The
antigen expression in I I patients with librocsstic disease and 12 patients with fibroadenomal
was simular to the normal group except for some cvtoplasmic immunoreactivity in selective
ducts ilt all cases and two fibroadenomas with strong staining. One of these sections with
predominantly stromal proliferation had strong ductal staining. There was intense cvtoplasmic
stairing in 3 out of 3 poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas.
Eltese results indicate that a recentlv charactensed MAb, P I II10, identifies an antigeni
differeittialls expressed in a number of carcinoma cell lines which was either not detected or
sweakls expressed in normal or benign ovanan and breast tissue. Further studies are
continuing to establish the antigen distribution in a larger cohort of malignant tissue and to
tunher charactense the antigen recognised bv the antibods.

EGFR and c-erbB-2 are being explored as therapeutic targets in
breast cancer. This approach will be enhanced if it is effective in pre-
invasive as well as invasive disease. We have found that EGFR is
downregulated and c-erbB-2 is overexpressed in 95% of invasive
breast cancers, but little is known about the role of these factors in in
Situ disease.
In frozen sections of invasive cancers with evidence of ductal
carcinoma in-situ (DCIS), EGFR (n=46) and c-erbB-2 (n=40)
receptor levels were assayed quantitatively using a radiolabelled
antibody method. Numbers of receptors were determined by
comparison with cell lines of known receptor density and compared
in each element of the tumour.
EGFR and c-erbB-2 expression each varied by a factor of several
thousand. The frequency distributions for expression of both factors
were comparable in DCIS and invasive tumours (Mann-Whitney U
test, EGFR p=0.41, c-erbB-2 p=0.56). Within each tumour, there was
no significant difference in expression of c-erbB-2 or EGFR in the
DCIS and invasive components (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, EGFR
p=0.419, c-erhB-2 p=0.343).
These data suggest that alterations in type I growth factor
receptors occur before progression of in-.situ disease to invasive
cancer. High levels of c-erhB-2 overexpression in both in-situ and
invasive areas suggest that the c-erbB-2 product is a potential
therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer at an early stage.

C-erbB-2 amplification or high levels of overexpression are
found in about 25% of breast cancers and these patients have a poor
outcome. Using a quantitative radioimmunohistochemical method in
frozen sections we have previously shown that c-erbB-2 is nearly
always overexpressed with gene amplification accounting for a
population with very high levels of expression.
Here we report on the application of
radioimmunohistochemistrv to measure the c-erbB-2 protein in a
larger set of cases (n = 182) with followup exceeding 5 years.
Disease specific survival was assessed using Kaplan Meier life table
analysis and log rank tests.
We found that 88% of tumours overexpressed c-erbB-2
compared to normal breast. 23% had greater than 20 times normal
expression, which we have previously shown, indicates amplification
at this locus. These cases had a significantly poorer survival than the
rest of the overexpressors (po0.0001). 12% of cases had lower than
normal c-erbB-2 expression and these patients also had a poorer
prognosis than the non-amplified overexpressors (p<0.0001).
Quantitative estimations of c-erbB-2 in frozen sections allow
measurements of the protein in nearly all cases whereas paraffin
section unmunohistochemistry provides subjective data only the
highest expressing cases. Tumours with down regulated c-erbB-2
have as poor a prognosis as those with gene amplification levels of
the protein.

The Wilms" tumour suppressor gene (WT 1), located on chromosome
II1 p13, encodes a nuclear transcription factor involved in the regulation of
the insulin-like growth factors and transforming growth factors pathways.
, As both systems have been found to be deregulated in breast
tumourigenesis, we undertook a study to determine the nuclear expression
ofWTI in various grades of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast,
a pre-invasive malignancy of the terminal duct epithelium.
Using a commercially available antibody to WT I (WTI C-19, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, USA). standard avidin-biotin coupled
immunocytochemistry with pressure cooker heat pre-treatment, was
performed on 37 cases of DCIS of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
, (FFPE). 51% (19/37) had an adjacent invasive component.
The DCIS was graded"' and categorised into a high grade (20/37) and a
non high grade (intermediate and low, 17/37) groups.
Nuclear staining for WTI stratified into negative(-), <50%/l positive (+),
>50%/ positive, indicated that:
, 1) There was no correlation between nuclear staining phenotype and the
presence of an adjacent invasive component (p=0.7308, x2 for trend)
2) There was a trend for pure DCIS cases with (-)/<50'/o(+) to be of higher
' grade.
Of the many technical approaches employed to evaluate the use of WT1 C-
19 in FFPE tissue, pressure cooker heat pre-treatment happened to be
optimal. However, despite statistical analysis of grade, nuclear staining and
the presence of an adjacent invasive component, this study gave little
information concerning the relevance of WT1 in early breast cancer by
immunocytochemistry.

For a sariety oftechnical reasons it is rarely possible to study
cytogenetic abnormalities in DCIS, using traditional techniques.
However, by combining molecular biology and computerised image
analysis techniques itis now possible to cariyout cytogenetic analyses
on formalin-fixed. paraffin-embedded tissue, using Comparative
Genomic Hybridisation (CGH). The purpose of this study was to identify
the prevalence ofchromosomal amplifications and deletions in high
grade DCIS, and to look specifically for unique or consistent
abnormalities in this preinvasive cancer.
We examined 23 cases of screen-detected high grade DCIS using a
combination oftumour microdissection from histology slides and CGH.
All cases showed chromosomal abnormalities. A wide variety of
amplifications and deletions were spread across the genome. . The most
frequent changes were gains of chromosomes 17(13 of23), 16p( 13 of
23), 20q (9 of23) and amplifications of I I q13 (22 of23), 12q 24.1-24.2
(12of23),6p21.3(I I of23) and lq3 I-qter(6of23). The most frequent
deletionswereon 13q213-q33 (7 of23),9p2l (4of23).and 6q16.1 (4
of23).
This is the first systematic cytogenetic study ofhigh grade DCIS, carried
out on mammographic screen-detected cancers. Our findings indicate
that high grade DCIS is, from a cytogenetic viewpoint, an advanced
lesion. There was no absolutely consistent finding in every case.
However, we found an amplification of 1 1q13 in 22 ofthe 23 cases. The
significance ofthis is unknown at present. It is likely that many ofour
findings are the result ofaccumulated chromosomal abnormalities,
reflecting an unstable genome in established malignancy.
P180 MITOGENIC ACTIONS OF HEREGULIN

MODELS L.M.R. Gilmour, K-G. Macleod, W.R. Miller, J.F. Smyth
and S.P. Langdon, ICRF Medical Oncology Unit, Western General
Hospital, Edinburgh EH4 2XU.
Increased expression of certain members of the c-erbB receptor
family (EGF receptor, erbB2, erbB3 and erbB4) has been linked with
poor prognosis in ovarian cancer suggesting that these receptors are
implicated in the growth and progression of this disease (Simpson BJB
et al, Int J Cancer 64: 202-206, 1995). The EGF receptor is activated by
TGF-a while erbB3 and erbB4 are activated by the heregulins (HRGs);
upon activation these receptors dimerise with each other and also erbB2
and initiate intracellular signalling. The HRG family exists as splice
variants and includes HRG-a and HRG-P (Holmes WE et al, Science
256: 1205-1210, 1992).
In the present study, we have investigated the effects of HRG-a,
HRG-P and TGF-cz on the growth of a range of ovarian cancer cell
lines. HRG-a (10-9M) and HRG-P (10-9M) produced growth stimulation
in 6 cell lines, inhibition in I line and had no effect in 3 cell lines.
TGF-a (10-9M) produced growth stimulation in 5 cell lines and had no
effect in 3 others. The magnitude of growth stimulation was greatest in
the order, HRG-P > TGF-a > HRG-a. RT-PCR demonstrated mRNA
expression of EGF receptor, erbB2 and erbB3 in 10 / 10 cell lines and
erbB4 in 5 / 10 cell lines. mRNA for TGF-a was detected in 10/ 10 cell
lines and HRG (either isoform) in 8 / 10 cell lines. Western blot analysis
with the antibodies erbB2 (CBI 1), erbB3 (RTJ2) and erbB4 (Ab2
Neomarkers) showed a range of receptor levels consistent with RT-PCR
data. Cell lines which were growth stimulated by the HRGs expressed
moderate levels of erbB2 in conjunction with moderate levels of erbB3
and or erbB4. Heterodimerisation was demonstrated by the observation
of tyrosine phosphorylation on erbB2 after activation with all 3 of the
above ligands in one of these cell lines.
These data demonstrate that both the HRGs and TGF-a are
mitogenic in many ovarian cancer models and are co-expressed with
their receptors; they may therefore regulate growth in an autocrine
manner.

The inactivation of multiple tumour suppressor genes is known to
play an important role in the development of ovarian cancer. One
strategy for locating putative tumour suppressor genes is to
analysis tumour DNA and matched blood samples for high rates of
loss of heterozygosity (LOH). The aim of this study was to carry
out LOH analysis of chromosome 7q using twelve microsatellite
markers on a panel of sixty-five ovarian tumours. The
microsatellites included four novel CALGT dinucleotide repeat
markers from the D7S522-GATA44F09 intervaL Overall 480o of
the tumours exhibited LOH at one or more of the markers assayed.
These losses spanned tumour stage and histological subtype.
Deletion of the entire chromosome arm was not observed in any
samples. The highest rate of loss (42%) was observed at the
marker CFT`R on 7q31.3. Twenty-five of the tumours examined
were benign. LOH was greatest in these at CFTR (919 informative
tumours. 47%/'O) and then at GATA44F09 (6 19 iLe. 32%o). In the
group of 32 malignant tumours. the highest rate of LOH was at
D7S522 (11/18. 61%). and then at 724CA (13/25). D7S633 (9/1 8.
50%). and CFTR (10123 tumours. 440O). Overall seven tumours
were identifiedwith partial deletions the vicinity of CFTR. These
findings provide strong support for the existence of a putative
tumour suppressor gene on 7q311. Further more the high level of
deletions observed in benign and early stage disease indicates that
this inactivational event occurs early in the development of
sporadic ovarian carcinomas

The identification of areas showing a high rate of loss of
heterozygosity (LOH) between matched control and tumour
DNA's has been widely used to map tumour suppressor
genes in sporadic cancers. There have been numerous
regions of high rates of LOH found on chromosome 17 in
sporadic eplthelial ovarian tumours. Whole chromosome
loss is common, but we have identified tumours with partial
losses on distal chromosome 17q. We have observed such
losses in benign, borderline and malignant tumours of all
histological subtypes. Fine deletion mapping has reduced
this area to a region on 17q25 centred around four
polymorphic markers which show zero recombination. We
have established a BAC and P1 contig of this entire region.
This contig spans - 200kb and is made up of 3 P1 clones of
-80kb, -40kb and -70kb and 1 BAC clone of -110kb. The
largest P1 clone and the BAC clone span the entire region
on their own with an overlap of -5kb. We have now
established a Noti, Sall restriction map of this region. This
has allowed us to order the markers D17S1790-
D17S937-D17S939-Afm203wc5. We are now proceeding
with the cloning of transcripts from this region.

Chromosome 17 harbors over two dozen related genes involved
in various types of cancer, neurological disorders and birth
defects. Of those involved in cancer, many are significant irk
ovarian disease.
In this study we have characterised chromosome 17 in eleven
human ovarian epithelial carcinoma cell lines; PEO14, PEO23"
TO14, PEA1, PEA2, OAW42, OTN14, A2780, PEO1, PEO4 and
PEO6. We describe chromosome 17 translocalions, p53
mutations and allelic status of the cell lines.
Cytogenetic analysis by FISH with a chromosome 17 painting
probe has shown the presence of complex chromosoma
rearrangements. The majority of translocations observe(
involved the telomeric region of chromosome 17.
The status of the tumour suppressor gene p53 has been
determined by immunocytochemistry, SSCP and sequencing
analysis. Our results indicate that mutation of p53 shows no
association with chromosome 17 translocations.
Mutation of p53 is often associated with loss of an entire
chromosome 17 homologue. We provide evidence that cell line
p53 mutation and loss of an entire copy of chromosome 1t
parallels results described in sporadic ovarian epithelial
tumours.
P184 INTERACTION OF OESTROGEN AND c-erbB2
SIGNALLING PATHWAYS IN OVARIAN CANCER'
CELLS, P. Mullen*, K. Macleod, G.J. Rabiasz, J.F. Smyth and S.P.
Langdon, ICRF Medical Oncology Unit, Western General Hospital,

Oestrogen has been shown to increase tyrosine phosphorylation of
several proteins, including c-erbB2, in human cancer cells under '
conditions of growth stimulation (Migliaccio et al, 1993, Oncogene, 8,
2183; Matsuda et al, 1993, PNAS, 90, 10803). However, over-expression
of c-erbB2 may also confer oestrogen resistance in oestrogen receptor'
(ER) positive cells (Pietras, et al, 1995, Oncogene, 10, 2435). The
interaction of these pathways has not previously been investigated in
ovarian cancer.
In the present study, we have investigated the relationship between
oestrogen-mediated growth stimulation and c-erbB2 activation in four
ovarian cancer cell lines. PE01, PE04, SKOV-3 and PE014 cell lines'
(ER concentrations of 96, 112, 66 and 0 fmol/mg respectively) were
treated with 17p-oestradiol (E2) (10-1OM) for 5 days. Growth
stimulation was observed in both the PE01 and PE04 cell lines but not '
in the SKOV-3 (ER-positive) or PE014 (ER-negative) lines. Expression
of c-erbB2 and its tyrosine phosphorylation were measured by Western
blot analysis using the CB II (Novo Castra) and PY20 (Santa Cruz N
Biotechnology) monoclonal antibodies respectively. Relative c-erbB2
levels for unstimulated PEOl, PE04, SKOV-3 and PE014 cells were 1: 2
8 : 2.5 respectively as measured by densitometry. Upon stimulation
with E2, PE01 and PE04 cell lines showed increased tyrosine
phosphorylation of c-erbB2 over a 15 min time course, this effect being
mediated within 2 min. Expression of c-erbB2 remained unchanged'
throughout this time period. In contrast, E2 produced no change in
either tyrosine phosphorylation or c-erbB2 levels in SKOV-3 or PE014
cell lines.
In conclusion, ER-positive ovarian cancer cells expressing only low-
moderate levels of c-erbB2 showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation
when growth-stimulated with E2. These data indicate that these
signalling pathways are interactive in ovarian cancer.

LOH of an 8.5 Mb region on chromosome 1 q has been associated
with advanced FIGO stage and poor survival in patients with ovarian
cancer. 556.1.5, a somatic cell hybrid, was used to transfer human
chromosome 11 by microcell mediated chromosome transfer into
OVCAR3 (an ovarian cancer cell line with chromosome 1 lq
rearrangement). Chromosome 11 microcell hybrid clones (MHCs)
remained immortalized and exhibited distinct phenotypes. Inhibition
of invasiveness in matrigel localized to distal 1 lq in a 4.5Mb region.
Analysis of 16 markers from the minimal region of interest in 87
cancer cell lines did not show any homozygous deletions. A growth
suppression phenotype was found to localize outside the distal 1 lq
region.
Candidate genes involved in the invasiveness and growth
suppression phenotype pathways are being identified using
Differential Display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR), cDNA-Representational
Difference Analysis and PCR-Select. DDRT-PCR has so far
identified more than 20 products which are differentially expressed
between MHCs ofdiffering phenotypes and the control cell line.
Products which relate either to the invasiveness phenotype or to the
growth suppression phenotype have been identified. Characterization
of these products is in progress. The DDRT-PCR products have been
excised from acrylamide, eluted, re-amplified by PCR and subcloned
into pGEM-T Easy vector. To determine their suitability for further
analyses, including mutation screening by combined SSCPE/
Heteroduplex analysis, sub-cloned products are undergoing a
standard screening protocol, comprising sequencing, database
homology searching, chromosomal localization and expression
profiling.

ABNORMALITIES IN LOW-GRADE SQUAMOUS
INTRAEPITHELIAL LESIONS, A.Giannoudis*, S. A. Southern and C.

Human Papillomaviruses have been associated with benign and
malignant neoplasms in humans and particularly with cervical cancer.
However, viral infection appears to be an early event and additional
abnormalities are required for biological transformation. We analysed
125 low grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (condylomata acuminata,
flat condylomata, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1) and
15 normal cervices for the presence of HPVs using both in situ
hybridisation (ISH) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was
performed with the LI consensus primers GP5+/GP6+ followed by
hybridisation using probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39,
40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68. Interphase cytogenetic
analysis using probes for chromosomes 1, 17, and X was also performed
to identify numerical chromosomal abnormalities.
Of the 125 lesions, 43 contained low-risk, and 78 high-risk
HPVs. Basal tetrasomy with all three chromosomes was identified in
20/78 (26%) lesions, infected with high-risk HPVs (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33,
35, 52, 56, 58, 66). None of the lesions infected with low-risk HPVs and
none of 15 normal cervices showed any numerical chromosomal
abnormality. Although tetrasomy was observed only in lesions infected
with high-risk HPV, these changes were not type-specific implying that
additional factors are required. However, these data indicate that
induction of chromosomal instability by high risk, but not low-risk, HPV
types, may be one mechanism underlying their biological differences.

P187 Papilloma Virus (HPV) DNA sequences and HLA
antigen expression in Papillary TCC bladder cancer.
AME Nouri, J Brewer, V Nargund. C Fowler, AMI Paris, RTD Oliver
A recent literature review of more than 700 cases In 15 publications has
demonstrated that approximately 1 in 5 papillary bladder cancers express
an HPV DNA sequences. As this proportion is similar to the number
with normal HLA expression in our previous studies. this study sets out
to examine the relationship between HLA expression in a series of
bladder cancer patients.
Snap frozen tissue was stained using standard immunoperoxidase
staining techniques for identification of HLA antigen expression. while
standard pcr with low strngencv for HPV viral DNA sequences
7 of 43 (16%) were positive for a range of HPV (2 HPV 16. 3 EV related
and 2 other mucosal subtypes). All 7 were W6/32 positive for HLA
monomorphic antigen detected by W6/32 and 6/7 positive for class 1
heavy chain antigen defined bya antibody HC 10 while ofthe HPV
negative tumours 75% were positive for W6/32 and 67% were positive
for HC 10.
The numbers tested are too small for definitive conclusion. However as
there is increasing evidence from study of papilloma viruses in bovine
bladder cancer that these viruses play a hit and run role in tumour
initiation, further study ofthese observations may provide an
explanation ofthe realtively low\ frequency of HPV infection in these
obvious papillary tumours.
