Abstract
Background: The Ribosomal protein S19 gene locus (RPS19) has been linked to two kinds of red cell aplasia, Diamond-
Blackfan Anemia (DBA) and Transient Erythroblastopenia in Childhood (TEC). Mutations in RPS19 coding sequences have
been found in 25% of DBA patients, but not in TEC patients. It has been suggested that non-coding RPS19 sequence
variants contribute to the considerable clinical variability in red cell aplasia. We therefore aimed at identifying non-coding
variations associated with DBA or TEC phenotypes.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We targeted a region of 19’980 bp encompassing the RPS19 gene in a cohort of 89 DBA
and TEC patients for resequencing. We provide here a catalog of the considerable, previously unrecognized degree of
variation in this region. We identified 73 variations (65 SNPs, 8 indels) that all are located outside of the RPS19 open reading
frame, and of which 67.1% are classified as novel. We hypothesize that specific alleles in non-coding regions of RPS19 could
alter the binding of regulatory proteins or transcription factors. Therefore, we carried out an extensive analysis to identify
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). A series of putative interaction sites coincide with detected variants. Sixteen of the
corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to
hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1).
Conclusions: Specific alleles at predicted TFBSs may alter the expression of RPS19, modify an important interaction between
transcription factors with overlapping TFBS or remove an important stimulus for hematopoiesis. We suggest that the
detected interactions are of importance for hematopoiesis and could provide new insights into individual response to
treatment.

Introduction
Diamond Blackfan Anemia (DBA) is a congenital pure red cell
aplasia (OMIM 205900) typically presenting within the first year
of life [1,2]. The gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19)
[3,4] has been shown to be mutated in 25% of DBA patients [5].
Recently, mutations in several other ribosomal protein genes have
been identified in approximately 10% of DBA patients [6–9].
Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC; OMIM
227050) is a transient red cell aplasia with clinical similarities to
DBA [10,11]. Linkage analysis has indicated an association
between TEC and the region encompassing RPS19 but no
structural mutations have been identified so far [12].
Until now, more than 70 RPS19 mutations have been reported
in DBA patients [5]. Mutations are spread out over the entire
gene, including non-sense and mis-sense mutations as well as
deletions and insertions. DBA is characterized by a marked clinical
heterogeneity without correlations to any specific mutation [2,13].
At least 30% of DBA patients respond to steroid treatment and
patients carrying RPS19 mutations display a poorer response [5].
The marked clinical heterogeneity strongly implies the involve-
ment of genetic and/or environmental tissue specific modulators
[2]. It has been suggested that the red cell aplasia is caused by
ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency. Consequently, the expres-
sion level of a specific ribosomal protein becomes critical for the
disease. The expression may be influenced by non-coding
variations resulting in a decrease in the amount of protein
available below a critical threshold [14]. Moreover, the clinical
variability associated with a mutation in a specific structural
ribosomal protein gene may be related to non-coding variants on
the non-mutant allele. Studies so far have focused on protein

coding parts and no detailed catalog of non-coding genetic
variation is available. The identification of putative regulatory
sequence elements in non-coding regions (such as transcription
factor binding sites) is therefore of importance for future research.
Many transcription factors (TFs) have been implicated in human
disorders, for example HNF4alpha in diabetes [15,16], USF1 in
familial combined hyperlipidemia [17] and AP2alpha in cleft
palate [18].
We therefore aimed at identifying non-coding variations that
are associated with the DBA or TEC phenotypes. Here, we report
on the targeted resequencing of the entire RPS19 locus in 77 DBA
and 12 TEC patients not carrying a mutation in exons of the
RPS19 gene and we provide a catalog of the genetic variations
identified. Furthermore, we searched the entire region for putative
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) some of which are
presumably altered by the variations identified. We suggest that
gene variants at TFBSs influence the expression of RPS19 with a
resulting effect on disease pattern and response to treatment.
These findings are important to clarify the regulation of RPS19
gene expression and for our understanding of the pathobiology
behind DBA.
Results
Genetic catalog of the RPS19 locus
We initially targeted a region of 14.7 kbp on human
chromosome 19 (chr19:47,053,043–47,068,080), encompassing
RPS19 and 2 kbp of flanking region (Accession numbers:
RSG_JCVI|RPS19-004110_004111-C_G, RSG_JCVI|RPS19-
005767_005771-D_CTAA). Variations were assigned in all
individuals to provide a genetic map of the RPS19 locus. In
addition, we analyzed a region upstream of the initial sequencing
effort in a subset of patients (chr19:47,048,100–47,053,043); both
analyzed regions together comprised of 19’980 bp (figure 1). We
detected a total of 73 variations of which 65 were single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs; 89.1%) and 8 were insertion/deletion
variants (indels; 10.9%). Forty-three SNPs (66.2%) and 6 indels
(75.0%) were not previously described and could be classified as
novel (figure 1 and table 1; SNPs identified in this study are
referred to as ‘‘novel’’ throughout this report - their subsequently
assigned database identifiers are listed in table 1). Altogether, 49 of
the variations identified (67.1%) were novel. One of the novel
indels overlaps with a known SNP (rs725332; table 1). All variants
are located outside of the protein coding sequence of RPS19.
Interestingly, the density of variations (SNP or indel) is one per
273.7 bp (3.6 variations kbp21
), including one SNP per 293.8 bp
(3.4 SNPs kbp21
). This is in contrast to the expected density of one
SNP per 1.9 to 2.18 kbp21
that has been estimated for human
chromosome 19 in previous studies [19,20]. Several of the
detected SNPs show a high frequency within the patient material
(table 1). However, a considerable number of variations (30 out of
73) show frequencies of less than 1% and the prevalence of these
‘‘private’’ or rare variations is high, compared to previous
estimates of 7% [21].
Comparative genomic sequence analysis of the RPS19
locus
Human RPS19 has homologs in eukaryotes and archaebacteria
but no eubacterial counterparts [22]. RPS19 is a component of the
40S subunit of the ribosome, which is important for regulation of
translation of mRNAs into polypeptides [23]. From all the
mammalian sequences available, we selected those assembled into
chromosomes with high coverage and lack of gaps in the targeted
genomic region, assuring gene synteny and that the original
structure of the human RPS19 gene is conserved (i.e. number and
order of exons). We obtained and aligned syntenic genomic
regions of 200 kb around the orthologous RPS19 gene from 6
species (mouse, dog, cow, orangutan, macaque and chimpanzee;
supplementary figure S1 and supplementary text S1). Infocon [24]
identified a total of 161 blocks of high information content
(BHICs) with highly conserved multi-species alignments within the
200 kb region. They averaged 20 bp in size and their distribution
in protein coding, non-coding and untranslated regions is shown in
supplementary figure S2. A high information content block is a
cluster of conservation between species where the alignment
contains information for every species represented. Because this
alignment is so highly conserved at almost every position, the
consensus sequence for each BHIC defaults to the reference
genome used in our alignment. 12 SNPs were contained in
BHICs, 10 of them are detailed in supplementary table S1. If we
consider the conservation of the polymorphic nucleotide, 7 of
them are totally conserved across species (novel-12, novel-14,
novel-15, novel-17, novel-18, rs2075749, rs2075750), 3 present a
miss-match in one of the species (novel-13, mouse; novel-40, dog;
rs1366610, mouse) and another 3 present two miss-matches
(novel-3, cow-dog; novel-42, cow-mouse; rs930102, human-cow).
With this analysis, we discovered that in many cases the human
variation is found across species. Additionally, we downloaded the
29-way eutherian mammals Enredo-Pecan-Ortheus (EPO) align-
ment track containing ultra-conserved elements from the En-
sEMBL database and compared this to our alignment results
(supplementary figure S1). From nine conserved elements defined
as EPO, five were entirely contained in our 7-way species
alignment. Surprisingly, two were not contained at all. None of the
novel SNPs was contained in a defined EPO region.
All information obtained in our report and from external
resources was converted into *.gff files in an effort towards
improving the annotation of the RPS19 locus (*.gff files can be
imported to the UCSC genome browser for visualization and are
compiled in supplementary text S2; see also figure S2).
Identified putative transcription factor binding sites that
superimpose with novel SNPs
We used the resulting multi-species alignment to analyze
whether any of the detected variation marks out any sequence
element important for regulation by modulators or regulating
factors. We searched selected genomic regions for putative
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) focusing on regions with
a high degree of conservation (figure 1). Our aim was to identify
whether any of the detected SNPs coincide with predicted TFBS.
A number of detected variations fall within putative TFBS
(supplementary table S1). Additionally, to further narrow down
the number of identified TFBS, we asked whether the identified
TFBS are likely to be functionally relevant for adaptations in
expression of RPS19 protein in the context of DBA/TEC. We
searched the literature for association of the corresponding
transcription factors to general transcription, tumorigenesis and
hematopoiesis. Sixteen different transcription factors (GATA-1
and -2, CDC5, Ebox, HOXA3, MSX-1, MZF1, PAX-2, -5 and -
6, PBX-1, PPARalpha, PPARgamma, PU.1, SP1, YY1) are of
particular interest with possible link to the DBA and TEC
phenotypes (e.g. important for hematopoiesis, implicated in cancer
development, strong general transcription factor). The putative
TFBS coincide with 23 of the detected variants (table 2). The
corresponding transcription factors bind to 15 possible sites
upstream of the RPS19 coding region (TFBS encompassing 19
SNPs), at one position within the second intron (one detected SNP)
and to three sites located in intron 4 (three SNPs). In some cases,

the TFBS was independently identified by two different tools/
databases (e.g. PBX-1 binding site in upstream region; table 2).
Comparative analysis of the proximal promoter region of
RPS19
Previous studies have tried to identify the promoter region of
RPS19. Our study confirms that the RPS19 promoter region shares
typical features with other mammalian ribosomal protein genes
(e.g. absence of a canonical TATA-box). We also detected an
accompanying non-consensus CCATT-box 72 to 83 bp upstream
of the transcription start site commonly described in public
databases (according to EnsEMBL). Three different transcription
start sites (TSS) have been described (BC018616; BC000023;
D28389) which differ only in the length of the 59UTR of the
resulting mRNA. We have observed additional 59UTR variants
differing in length between 33 to 467 nucleotides (unpublished
data). The observed spread of the TSS together with the absence
of a canonical TATA-box classify the RPS19 promoter as ‘‘broad
type promoter’’ according to Sandelin and colleagues [25].
Interestingly, the TSS stretch encompasses regions important for
expression of RPS19 described previously by DaCosta et al.
(figure 1) [26]. The authors identified regions of high conservation
between mouse and human in the putative promoter region of
RPS19, regions we also detect in our analysis (figure 1A). They
predicted a promoter sequence and subsequently showed that the
predicted promoter sequence and one of the conserved regions are
important for expression of a reporter construct [26].
We did not detect any variation in the 1.5 kb proximal region
upstream of the first exon. This region is additionally character-
ized by a high degree of conservation (figure 1_1). These findings
underscore the importance of this region for expression of RPS19.
DaCosta and colleagues identified several putative TFBS within
the upstream region of RPS19 [26]. We checked whether we could
reproduce their predictions of TFBS. In several cases, we obtained
an even finer consensus motif (e.g. n-Myc, figure 1). In their study,
DaCosta and coworkers define a strong C-Rel/Rel-A site that
coincides with an NF-kB site. This is not surprising, because NF-
kB is known to bind C-Rel in transcriptional regulatory systems
[27]. Our matrix used in this detection is actually capable of
detecting such a consensus site but cataloged it as NF-kB. Finally,
we detected the SP1 motif in the first conserved region and an SP1
instead of the CACCC-Bf binding site [26]. This particular SP1
binding site (CCACCC) has been described as a regulatory switch
element that stimulates SP1/GATA1 cooperation, and the
consensus sequence is similar to the CACCC-Bf sequence [28].
Discussion
Association studies take advantage of the known variations
throughout the human genome including SNPs and microsatel-
lites. It has been suggested that the identification of all the
potential risk-conferring variations within one disease associated
gene is important for appropriate genotype-phenotype correlations
[29,30]. Targeted resequencing studies are therefore an important
step that may provide detailed catalogs of genomic variations to
further studies of the mechanisms underlying diseases and
pharmacogenetic responses [31]. We focused our efforts on the
resequencing analysis of the RPS19 gene locus, a region that has
been linked to two forms of anemia, namely Diamond-Blackfan
Anemia (DBA) and Transient Erythroblastopenia of childhood
(TEC) [12,32]. Our initial goal was to identify non-coding
polymorphisms that are associated with either disease.
In the present resequencing study, we show a considerable and
previously unrecognized variation within the RPS19 gene locus.
Estimates have approximated the degree of variation for
chromosome 19 to 1 SNP in about 2 kbp of sequence [19,21].
We show here that the genetic variation at the RPS19 locus in our
patient cohort is significantly higher, with 1 SNP per 294 bp, and
provide a catalog of additional variations associated with DBA and
TEC. A large proportion of the presented variations consists of
‘‘private’’ SNPs. Interestingly, independent resequencing studies of
e.g. the innate immunity genes and the APO gene cluster have also
detected an unexpectedly high degree of variation [20,29]. The
high degree of variation in this study and the fact that RPS19
seems to play a central role in a large proportion of DBA patients
suggest that regulatory networks altered by one or the other SNP
may have implications for RPS19 expression.
However, our results revealed no clear correlation between any
of the identified SNPs and either of the DBA or TEC phenotypes.
Linkage analyses have previously indicated co-segregation of the
two disorders suggesting they are allelic variants [4,12,32]. This
lack of phenotype-genotype correlation may indicate that there
exists an as yet unidentified sequence element in this region
responsible for the regulation of RPS19 expression. Indeed, it has
been described that regulatory elements may be situated far away
from the actual gene. Mutations in such elements have previously
been implicated in human diseases [33]. Alternatively, the
observed linkage of this region to TEC patients is not due to
mutations in RPS19, but to a different gene within the 1 Mbp
region described previously [4]. Although the region contains a
number of genes, no other ribosomal protein gene is located within
this 19q13.2 region and no candidate gene of known relevance for
erythropoiesis could be identified.
Consequently, we hypothesized that mutations in non-coding
regions of RPS19 could disrupt the binding of regulatory proteins.
We aimed to identify new regulatory modulators and carried out a
bioinformatics analysis of the locus to identify putative transcrip-
tion factor binding sites (TFBS). As a result, we obtained a catalog
of variations within our patient cohort and we provide a map of
putative transcription factor binding sites (table 2 and supplemen-
tary table S1). Several of the corresponding transcription factors
(TF) are of particular interest. Ten of the identified TFs are
ubiquitously or widely expressed (i.e. general transcription factors)
and important for regulation of development, cell cycle and cell

division, and cell plasticity (Cell division control protein 5 (CDC5);
Homeobox cluster protein A3 (HOXA3); Msh-like homebox
protein 1 (MSX-1); Paired box transcription factors (PAX);
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARalpha and
gamma); SP1 transcription factor (SP1); YY1 transcription factor
(YY1)) [34–36]. Variations in the TFBS of these factors could
possibly lead to altered transcriptional activity of the RPS19 gene,
as has been described previously for transcription factors and the
Ebox module [37–40]. A marked reduction in the transcriptional
activity of RPS19 may have effects similar to that observed for
haploinsufficiency. Strikingly, the non-reference allele of one SNP
(rs3214574) deletes the putative binding site for CDC5. Instead, a
strong TFBS for GATA-1/2 is created. This suggests a significant
change for tissue specific expression. Moreover, the general TFs as
well as the Ebox binding site could be pivotal for cellular response
to extracellular stimuli and this may explain individual response to
treatment or endogenous cytokines [41–43]. Furthermore, several
of these general transcription factors have been shown to play a
role in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis for which ribosomal
protein genes are essential [44–47].
Six TFBS identified in our study are even more interesting
(GATA binding proteins 1 and 2 (GATA-1 and GATA-2); Myeloid
zinc finger 1 (MZF-1); Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX-1);
hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1 (PU.1); Ebox binding site).
They belong to factors with a direct link to hematopoiesis [48–53].
Several of these factors are involved in the progression to leukemia
and they are essential for normal hematopoiesis (e.g. PU.1). We
speculate that these factors may play a crucial role in the
transcription of RPS19 during hematopoiesis, and alterations in
the respective TFBS could lead to diminished RPS19 expression.
This might render erythroid precursors to be less capable to
proliferate, which has been suggested as a mechanism underlying
DBA in patients with mutations in the coding sequence of RPS19
[14]. On the other hand, alterations in TFBS could also lead to
increased levels of RPS19 and in the best case promote remission
which is seen to occur spontaneously.
Another possible mechanism is that specific alleles in SNPs
overlapping with the TFBS for PU.1, GATA-1/2 or PBX-1 might
be of importance for the development of hematopoietic stem cells
by altering their capacity of self-renewal, expansion and
quiescence [50,53,54]. These factors are candidates in the
mechanism underlying a block in erythroblast expansion and
differentiation in DBA patients [55].
In summary, we report here on the considerable individual
variation detected in our resequencing study of the disease locus
RPS19 in DBA and TEC patients. Furthermore, we identified a
series of transcription factors putatively involved in the regulation
of RPS19 expression and implicated in the pathobiology of DBA
and TEC. Functional follow-up studies are needed to further
investigate the predicted interactions described in this report.
Methods
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board
of Uppsala (Diary Number 2006/118). Informed consent of patients
or their parents was obtained and has been documented in the
patient files by the responsible clinician following routines approved
by the Regional Ethics Board and according to Swedish legislation.
Patient cohort
We analyzed DNA prepared from peripheral blood of 77 DBA
and 12 TEC patients of Caucasian origin. Patients included in the
study were excluded by sequencing to carry a structural mutation

in RPS17, RPS19 or RPS24, respectively (Primer sequences
available on request). Most of the patients are sporadic cases,
except for 10 of the DBA patients and eight of the TEC patients
who previously showed association with this genomic region. All
patients were ascertained by hematologists of their country for
criteria for DBA or TEC, respectively, and have been described
previously [4,12,32].
Resequencing
Resequencing was carried out as described (METHOD-A;
dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/)). Additional se-
quence analysis was performed by sequencing standard PCR
products (from approximately 2 mg genomic DNA) in both
directions on an ABI PRISMH 3700 DNA Analyzer (AppliedBio-
systems) according to manufacturer’s protocol and using Se-
quencherH Programme for analysis of the resulting sequences.
Primer sequences are listed in supplementary table S2.
Comparative genomic sequence analysis
200 kb of the human genome sequence around the RPS19 gene
locus (hg18; chr19:47,048,239–47,068,000) as well as orthologous
sequences for six mammalian species in different orders (rodents
[mouse], canines [dog], ungulates [cow], primates [orangutan,
macaque and chimpanzee]) were retrieved from EnsEMBL
(http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/) [56], assuring gene
synteny was conserved and gaps were not extensive (supplemen-
tary text S1 and supplementary figure S1). MultiPipMaker aligned
these orthologous sequences with the ‘single coverage’ option to
eliminate matches caused by duplications and the ‘search both
strand’ option [57]. The identified multi-species conserved
sequences were analyzed by virtue of the Infocon program [24].
Infocon identifies blocks of high information content (BHIC) in
parts of the alignment and optionally calculates a consensus
sequence in each block. A BHIC is a cluster of conservation
between species in which the alignment contains information for
every species considered for the alignment.
In order to obtain a more informative alignment of the
mammalian clade, the multi-species alignment EPO track was
downloaded from EnsEMBL containing elements conserved along
29 eutherian mammals and subsequently converted into a *.gff file
(supplementary texts S1 and S2). For a description of the *.gff file
format see http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF/
GFF_Spec.shtml.
Prediction of transcription factor binding motifs
Sequences of the whole human RPS19 upstream gene region
(hg18; chr19:47,048,239–47,056,684) as well as 2nd
and 4th
introns
(chr19:47,056,756–47,057,020 and chr19:47,065,125–47,065,608,
respectively) and the 6 mammalian species already mentioned
were subjected to a transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)
detection with help of various programs: MotifScanner, Moti-
fLocator, MotifSampler, MATCH and pMATCH.
These programs identify over-represented motifs in a sequence
data set and annotate putative binding sites consulting libraries of
position weight matrices (PWMs). PWMs represent the intrinsic
sequence variability of TFBS in the form of a matrix. Each matrix
stores the frequency for each nucleotide at every position of the
putative motif in order to summarize the alignment information
for the TF with a binding site. The libraries of PWMs used in this
study were Jaspar [58] and TRANSFAC Professional (releases 7.0
(public), 11.2 and 12.1) [59]. The professional version of
TRANSFAC requires licensing.
MotifScanner uses different orders of markov chains as
background model for matching PWMs. A parameter called a
‘prior’ assigns an a priori probability of TFs binding to a distinct
sequence. In MotifLocator the ‘prior’ is substituted by a posterior
threshold for filtering matching PWMs. The resulting scores, in an
absolute scale without log correction, represent the likelihood ratio
of a certain PWM match versus a random match. MotifSampler
[60] implements a stochastic model of a Gibbs sampler to detect
‘‘over-represented’’ motifs not matching any known PWM. We
always used the default parameters and third order vertebrate and
human models (Eukaryotic Promoter Database and dbTSS) for
MotifScanner and MotifLocator when searching against TRANS-
FAC and Jaspar libraries. All these programs are contained in a
workbench for regulatory sequence analysis called TOUCAN
[61].
MATCH [62] and pMATCH [63] are closely interconnected
with the TRANSFAC database. MATCH was executed to
minimize the false positives error (minFP) to guarantee specificity,
whilst pMATCH was selected with minimization for FP and
combined with the sum of both false positive and false negative
errors (minSUM) to increase sensitivity.
There are other recognition tools for promoter and regulatory
motif analysis available: RSAT (Universite Libre de Bruxelles),
TESS (University of Pennsylvania), TSSG/TSSW (Baylor College
of Medicine), MatInspector (Genomatix Gmbh), SiteSeer (Uni-
versity of Manchester), AliBaba2 (BioBase Gmbh), FUNSITE
(ICG), Footprinter (University of Washington). However, we used
the tools best integrated with the libraries used in the study.
Additionally, several Perl scripts were created to perform data
analysis in the suitable tools, parse TFBS annotations into *.gff files
and filter overlapping SNPs within selected TFBS. All available
annotations of the locus were manually formatted into *.gff files
(supplementary text S2). Images of the RPS19 locus containing
variations, conserved areas, annotations and TFBS provided
within this report were created using the UCSC Genome Browser
(http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/) [64].
