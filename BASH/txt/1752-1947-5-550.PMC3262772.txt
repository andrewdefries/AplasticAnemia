Abstract
Introduction: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired disorder of hemopoiesis and is characterized by
recurrent episodes of intravascular hemolysis due to an increased sensitivity to complement-mediated hemolysis.
Systemic lupus erythematosus with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is very rare. We report a case of
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria that developed in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus
nephritis.
Case presentation: A 29-year-old Mongolian woman had systemic lupus erythematosus, which manifested only as
skin lesions when she was 12 years old. She had leg edema and proteinuria when she was 23 years old, and a
renal biopsy revealed lupus nephritis (World Health Organization type IV). She had been treated with steroids and
immunosuppressant therapy. At 29, she had headaches, nausea, general fatigue, and severe pancytopenia and was
admitted to our hospital. A laboratory evaluation showed hemolytic anemia. Further examination showed a
neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score of 46 points, a CD55 value of 18%, and a CD59 value of 78.6%. The results of
Ham test and sugar water tests were positive. The constellation of symptoms throughout the clinical course and
the laboratory findings suggested paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, systemic lupus erythematosus with paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria is very rare. Clinicians should be aware of the association between autoimmune and
hematological diseases.
Introduction
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an
acquired disorder of hemopoiesis and is characterized
by recurrent episodes of intravascular hemolysis due to
an increased sensitivity to complement-mediated hemo-
lysis [1]. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with PNH
is very rare. We present a case of PNH that developed
in a 29-year-old woman who had SLE.
Case presentation
A 29-year-old Mongolian woman had SLE, which mani-
fested only as skin lesions when she was 12 years old.
Because she had leg edema and proteinuria with serolo-
gical and hematological abnormalities - the titers of
anti-nuclear antibody and double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) antibody were increased and the lymphocyte
count was decreased - at 23 years old, a renal biopsy
was performed. The results revealed lupus nephritis
(World Health Organization type IV). Her condition
was diagnosed as SLE according to the criteria of the
American College of Rheumatology [2]. She had been
treated with steroids and immunosuppressants, includ-
ing cyclophosphamide. She had pancytopenia at 25 years
old, and secondary aplastic anemia, probably due to
cyclophosphamide, was diagnosed. Pancytopenia was
worsening six months after the onset of pancytopenia
and therefore cyclosporine A was administered. When
she was 28 years old, rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed
because of polyarthralgia and morning stiffness. After 2
months, she had severe headaches, and cerebral venous
thrombosis was diagnosed by computed tomography.
Laboratory data showed a high level of lactate

dehydrogenase (LDH), a low level of haptoglobin, and a
negative Coombs test result. These results suggested
that she had hemolytic anemia, and the dose of steroid
was increased. Her condition improved gradually.
When she was 29 years old, she had headaches, nau-
sea, general fatigue, and severe pancytopenia and was
admitted to our hospital. A laboratory evaluation
showed the following: hemoglobin of 7.3 g/dL, white
blood cell count of 11,400/μL, platelets of 4.2 × 104
/μL,
total protein of 4.9 g/dL, albumin of 2.3 g/dL, LDH of
1085 U/L, total bilirubin of 1.6 mg/dL, blood urea nitro-
gen of 34 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, C-reactive
protein of 11.5 mg/dL, haptoglobin of less than 6 mg/
dL, and dsDNA antibody of 5 IU/L. The results of
direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative. Further
examination showed a neutrophil alkaline phosphatase
score of 46 points, a CD55 value of 18%, and a CD59
value of 78.6%. The results of Ham test and sugar water
tests were positive. Her urine was red because of hemo-
lysis (Figure 1). The constellation of symptoms through-
out the clinical course and the laboratory findings
suggested PNH.
Discussion
PNH is an acquired disorder of hemopoiesis and is
characterized by recurrent episodes of intravascular
hemolysis due to an increased sensitivity to comple-
ment-mediated hemolysis [1]. A crucial pathophysiologi-
cal mechanism is an acquired defect of the
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, namely
CD55 and CD59 [3].
Flow cytometry analysis of red blood cells with mono-
clonal antibodies directed against CD55 and CD59 is
now the gold standard technique for the diagnosis of
PNH [4]. The normal values of CD55 and CD59 are
more than 85.4% and more than 99.8%, respectively. In
the present case, the values of CD55 and CD59 were
18% and 78.6%, respectively. Consequently, PNH was
diagnosed.
PNH presents three clinical manifestations: (a) an
acquired intravascular hemolytic anemia due to the
increased susceptibility of the erythrocyte membrane to
complement-mediated lysis; (b) thrombosis in large ves-
sels, such as hepatic, abdominal, cerebral, and subdermal
veins; and (c) mild to severe bone marrow hypoplasia

that results in different degrees of pancytopenia. The
triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and pancytopenia
makes PNH a truly unusual clinical syndrome [5]. These
manifestations were visible in our case.
Deficient expression of CD55 and CD59 has recently
been reported in patients with autoimmune hemolytic
anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, or SLE [6,7].
An autoimmune condition such as SLE may contribute
to the pathogenesis of PNH [8]. It is a very interesting
phenomenon and might be associated with the patho-
genesis of our present case.
Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, SLE with PNH is very
rare and its mechanism is unknown. Clinicians should
be aware of the association between autoimmune dis-
ease and PNH.
