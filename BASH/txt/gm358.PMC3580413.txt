Abstract
Background: Genome-wide association studies have identified several genomic regions that are associated with
stroke risk, but these provide an explanation for only a small fraction of familial stroke aggregation. Genotype by
environment interactions may contribute further to such an explanation. The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)
clinical trial found increased stroke risk with postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) and provides an efficient
setting for evaluating genotype-HT interaction on stroke risk.
Methods: We examined HT by genotype interactions for 392 SNPs selected from candidate gene studies, and
2,371 SNPs associated with changes in blood protein concentrations after hormone therapy, in analyses that
included 2,045 postmenopausal women who developed stroke during WHI clinical trial and observational study
follow-up and one-to-one matched controls. A two-stage procedure was implemented where SNPs passing the
first stage screening based on marginal association with stroke risk were tested in the second stage for interaction
with HT using case-only analysis.
Results: The two-stage procedure identified two SNPs, rs2154299 and rs12194855, in the coagulation factor XIII
subunit A (F13A1) region and two SNPs, rs630431 and rs560892, in the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9
(PCSK9) region, with an estimated false discovery rate <0.05 based on interaction tests. Further analyses showed
significant stroke risk interaction between these F13A1 SNPs and estrogen plus progestin (E+P) treatment for
ischemic stroke and for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke combined, and suggested interactions between PCSK9
SNPs with either E+P or estrogen-alone treatment.
Conclusions: Genotype by environment interaction information may help to define genomic regions relevant to
stroke risk. Two-stage analysis among postmenopausal women generates novel hypotheses concerning the F13A1
and PCSK9 genomic regions and the effects of hormonal exposures on postmenopausal stroke risk for subsequent
independent validation.
Background
In the past few years, genome-wide association studies
have identified many common genetic variants associated
with complex diseases. Most of the associations identified
so far, however, explain only a small fraction of familial
disease aggregation, which suggests that studies exploring
additional human genome-related associations, such as
those related to rare genetic variants, gene-gene interac-
tions, and gene-environment interactions, could play an
important role in accounting for the ‘missing heritability’
[1]. In the case of stroke, several genome-wide association
studies have been performed to identify SNP associations,
yet no single locus identified has been successfully repli-
cated in a second study [2-9]. The complex nature of
stroke risk, which may involve interactions between biolo-
gical pathways, and the largely unexplained heritability
suggest that gene-gene and gene-environment interactions* Correspondence: rprentic@fhcrc.org

could have a significant impact on the search for stroke-
related SNPs [10,11].
A major challenge in assessing gene-environment inter-
action is the difficulty in characterizing environmental
exposures precisely in an observational study setting,
which has been the setting for most of the gene-environ-
ment interaction studies to date. Randomized controlled
intervention trials, on the other hand, provide natural
settings for incorporating gene-environment interaction
assessment into the search for disease-susceptible SNPs
since the treatment/intervention assignment is known
exactly. An additional advantage of randomization is the
resulting independence between intervention assignment
and genotype, which justifies highly efficient case-only
testing of interaction between SNPs and intervention in
relation to disease risk [12-17].
The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) studies include
two major components: a randomized controlled trial
(CT) and an observational study (OS). The WHI trial
included four randomized and controlled comparisons
among postmenopausal women, in a partial factorial
design [18,19]. Specifically, it comprised a postmenopau-
sal hormone therapy component that involved two non-
overlapping trials: an estrogen versus placebo (E-alone)
trial among women who were post-hysterectomy, and an
estrogen plus progestin versus placebo (E+P) trial among
women with a uterus; a low-fat dietary modification
(DM) versus usual diet component, and a calcium and
vitamin D (CaD) supplementation versus placebo
component.
The E+P trial was stopped early in 2002, triggered by an
elevation of breast cancer risk and an overall unfavorable
health benefit versus risk profile [20,21]. An important
health risk was an approximate 40% elevation of stroke
risk [22]. The E-alone trial was also stopped early, in 2004,
primarily due to an elevation of stroke risk of similar mag-
nitude to that seen for E+P [23,24]. The elevated stroke
risks associated with the use of estrogen or estrogen plus
progestin were not observed in the OS, where there was
evidence of residual confounding [25]. Neither the DM
nor the CaD trial yielded evidence of an intervention effect
on stroke risk [26,27].
Here we study 2,763 candidate SNPs in relation to
stroke incidence and hormone therapy (HT) intervention
(E-alone and E+P) effects. These SNPs were evaluated in
stroke cases and one-to-one matched controls in WHI
cohorts as a ‘core’ WHI project that sought to identify
SNPs that interact with hormone therapy effects on stroke
risk.
Our analyses apply a novel two-stage procedure by first
screening out unpromising SNPs based on marginal asso-
ciation tests with stroke using all available case-control
samples from the WHI CT and OS, and then in the sec-
ond stage investigating SNP-HT interaction only for SNPs
meeting first-stage filtering criteria among stroke cases in
the HT trials [28-30]. The independence between the test
statistics for marginal association of SNPs and the case-
only test statistics for interaction has been demonstrated
in [29]. As a result, with a pre-determined threshold for
marginal significance in the first-stage screening (chosen
as 0.05), we only need to correct for the number of SNPs
passing the first-stage filtering in evaluating gene-interven-
tion interaction. This analytic approach preserves statisti-
cal power for interaction identification for the most
promising SNPs.
Materials and methods
Study design and population
Enrollees in WHI trials were postmenopausal women
aged 50 to 79 years who met component-specific elig-
ibility criteria [31]. Women were randomized to a HT
component, or a DM component, or both. At the one-
year anniversary from enrollment participating women
could be further randomized into the CaD supplementa-
tion component. A total of 68,132 women were enrolled
into the trials between 1993 and 1998, among which
there were 10,739 in E-alone, 16,608 in E+P, 48,835 in
DM, and 36,282 in CaD components. The WHI OS
enrolled 93,676 postmenopausal women and participants
were followed for 6 to 10 years during the intervention
phase of the WHI program. Details about distributions
of demographic variables and stroke risk factors in the
study cohort were published previously [31].
Case and control selection
Overall, 2,096 stroke cases were considered for inclusion,
including all stroke cases in the WHI clinical trials that
developed between randomization and August 2007 and
a subset of stroke cases in the OS that occurred following
the time of case selection in a WHI pooled data genome-
wide association study but prior to August 2007. Also
considered were corresponding controls one-to-one
matched to cases on baseline age, self-reported ethnicity,
cohort (CT versus OS) and participation in each compo-
nent if in the clinical trial, years since randomization/
enrollment, baseline hysterectomy status, and prevalent
stroke at enrollment. Among these, a total of 2,045
(97.6%) cases had adequate quantity and quality of DNA
for this project. Of these, 149 (7.3%) cases had a prior
history of stroke at baseline. Each case was matched to a
qualifying control also having a suitable DNA specimen
available, leading to an equal number of cases and con-
trols in each CT or OS component. The number of
included cases (or controls) was 351 in the E-alone trial,
438 in the E+P trial, 1,110 in the DM trial, 838 in the
CaD trial (cases arising after CaD randomization only),
and 373 in the OS (Table 1). The comparatively small
number of cases from the OS occurs because of the

exclusion of stroke cases included in the earlier WHI
pooled DNA study mentioned above. Table 1 also pre-
sents the number of cases stratified further by stroke
subcategory.
Informed consent was obtained from each study parti-
cipant and the research conformed to the Helsinki
Declaration and to all pertinent local legislation.
Laboratory methods and SNP selection
SNPs were genotyped and quality control criteria were
applied at Perlegen Sciences (Mountain View, CA,
USA). Genotyping and data cleaning methods have been
described [32], with an average call rate of 99.8% and an
average concordance rate of 99.8% for 157 blind dupli-
cate samples.
Principal component analysis was used to characterize
population structure and to identify genotyping artifacts.
The top 20 principal components did not associate with
common sources of experimental variability such as date
of sample processing or hybridization performance for
either chip design.
The 2,763 candidate SNPs evaluated in this paper
cover 400 chromosomal regions with pairwise correla-
tion r2
between regions <0.2. Among these, 392 were
selected from candidate genes previously reported to be
related to stroke risk [4,33-35], and 2,371 were selected
based on WHI studies of potential changes in blood
protein concentrations following the initiation of hor-
mone therapy [36,37].
Statistical methods
A two-stage procedure as proposed in [29,30] was
implemented for identification of SNP-HT interaction.
First stage filtering
In the first stage, the marginal effect for each SNP indi-
vidually was estimated from a standard logistic regres-
sion of case (1) versus control (0) status on number of
minor SNP alleles and potential confounding factors
based on all case-control samples in CT and OS. The
logistic regression model included smoking status, phy-
sical functioning score, history of treated diabetes,
prevalent hypertension, current aspirin use and current
statin use. Also included were the variables used for
matching controls to cases in control selection and clini-
cal trial randomization assignments. In addition, eigen-
vectors from the first ten principal components from
correlation analysis of the genotype data were included
to adjust for population stratification [38]. All SNPs
with two-sided P-value < 0.05 were entered into the sec-
ond stage for evaluation of interaction with HT.
Second stage
At the second stage, a two-component test statistic was
used for each SNP to test for interaction with HT on
stroke risk. The independence between HT treatment
assignment and genotype in E-alone and E+P ensured
by randomization allows the use of the case-only analy-
sis for interaction testing, a more efficient method com-
pared to standard case-control analysis. The two test
statistic components are case-only tests for dependence
of intervention odds ratios on SNP genotype for each of
E-alone and E+P, respectively. These statistics arise as
likelihood ratio test statistics in logistic regression of
active (1) versus placebo randomization assignment on
the number of minor SNP alleles with logistic regression
location parameter offset by log q/(1 - q), where q is the
fraction of women assigned to active intervention for
the pertinent clinical trial component. That is, for cases
within the E-alone or E+P trial separately, we fit a
model with:
logit Pr(Z = 1|G ) = log(q/(1 − q)) + β0 + β2G
where Z = 0, 1 indicates assignment to placebo or
treatment arm, respectively, and G is the number of
minor alleles for the SNP considered.
The interaction tests for E-alone and E+P are inde-
pendent of each other since they are based on non-over-
lapping sets of women. The two test statistics were
added to yield a chi-square test with two degrees of
freedom to test SNP interaction with HT on stroke risk
for each of the SNPs. Control for multiple testing was
carried out by requiring the estimated false discovery
rate (FDR) [39] to be < 0.05.
SNPs of interest in the interaction test were subse-
quently examined for evidence of interaction effects
with E-alone and E+P separately, both for all stroke
cases and by major stroke subcategory (ischemic,
hemorrhagic). Again, case-only analyses were employed,
and for descriptive purposes, intervention odds ratios
were estimated separately at zero, one, and two minor
SNP alleles. Likelihood ratio tests with both one and
two degrees of freedom (reflecting whether SNP geno-
type was modeled as a linear term in the number of
minor SNP alleles, or a separate indicator variables for
one and for two minor alleles) were examined to assess
SNP by intervention interaction in these analyses. All

significance levels (P-values) were two-sided. Note that
the odds ratio estimates in these case-only analyses are
(asymptotically) independent of those from the stage 1
analyses [29,30], so that only the number of SNPs
included in stage 2 need to be considered in examining
these odds ratios estimates for multiple testing-related
biases.
The potential of SNP by HT interactions to contribute
to the ability to discriminate between stroke cases and
controls was evaluated by estimating areas under the
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), and asso-
ciated confidence intervals.
Results
Tests of interaction with hormonal therapy
Among the 2,763 SNPs studied, 112 SNPs passed the
first stage screening threshold with a marginal effect P-
value < 0.05, based on the additive allele log-odds
model. Among these, 22 were from selected earlier lit-
erature reports and 90 were selected based on WHI pro-
teomics studies. These 112 SNPs were then entered into
the second stage analysis for testing of interaction with
HT based on the simultaneous case-only test with two
degrees of freedom. Information about the 112 SNPs is
presented in Additional file 1.
Table 2 presents the top 10 SNPs ranked by P-value
of the simultaneous test of interaction with HT, among
the 112 SNPs entering the second stage analysis. Four
SNPs had an interaction test FDR <0.05. Specifically, the
top two SNPs, rs2154299 and rs12194855, ranked by
interaction test P-value are located in an intronic region
of the coagulation factor XIII subunit A gene (F13A1)
on chromosome region 6p25. These SNPs were found
to be associated with risk of ischemic stroke in an ear-
lier study [35]. The two SNPs are in high linkage
disequilibrium with each other, with pairwise correlation
r2
> 0.98, and have significant interaction with HT at
the 0.05 level even after Bonferroni correction for the
112 interaction tests conducted in the second stage ana-
lysis. The other two SNPs identified are from an intro-
nic region of the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin
9 gene (PCSK9) in the genomic region of chromosome
1p32, the protein product of which was found to be
increased by E-alone intervention in the WHI E-alone
trial [36]. The two SNPs in the PCSK9 region are also in
high linkage disequilibrium (r2
> 0.98) with each other.
We further investigated these four SNPs for their
interaction with the E-alone and E+P interventions sepa-
rately and by stroke subcategory. Table 3 shows esti-
mated HT intervention odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals as a function of the number of minor alleles
for the two SNPs in the F13A1 region, for all stroke
types together and for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke
separately. For both SNPs, a larger number of minor
alleles (A for rs2154299 and G for rs12194855) appears
to be associated with a lower E+P odds ratio. The pat-
tern is consistent within ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke
cases. The trends are in the same direction for E-alone,
but not significant. Corresponding results for the two
SNPs in the PCSK9 region are shown in Table 4. For
both SNPs, there are suggestions that a larger number
of minor alleles (G for rs630431 and G for rs568052)
are associated with a lower E+P odds ratio, but a higher
E-alone odds ratio, for all stroke types altogether and
for ischemic stroke. The interactions of the two PCSK9
SNPs with either E-alone or E+P alone are only nomin-
ally significant.
The majority (81%) of the case-control samples are
from European-ancestry women. In Additional files 2
and 3 we provide P-values for interaction between HT

Additionally, we examined the joint effect of the
F13A1 SNPs and PCSK9 SNPs in interacting with E+P
intervention, using case-only analysis. Based on logistic
regression applied to cases in the E+P trial, where the
indicator for active treatment is regressed on genotypes
of rs2154299 and rs630431 together, both SNPs showed
nominally significant interactions. Specifically, when the
indicators for one or two minor alleles are included in
the regression, the nominal P-values based on likelihood
ratio test with two degrees of freedom for rs2154299
and rs630431 were 0.0009 and 0.013 when all stroke
types are considered and 0.004 and 0.025 for ischemic
stroke. When numbers of minor alleles are included in
the regression assuming ‘monotone’ interaction, the
nominal P-values based on a likelihood ratio test with
one degree of freedom for rs2154299 and rs630431 were
0.0002 and 0.005 when all stroke types were considered
and 0.001 and 0.008 for ischemic stroke.
To examine the added benefit of including SNPs in the
two regions for discriminating stroke cases from controls,
we calculated the AUC from logistic regression analyses
that included matching covariates, clinical trial randomi-
zation assignments for each of the four interventions,
and the potential confounding factors listed above. This
gave an AUC (95% confidence interval) of 0.645 (0.634,
0.666) for overall stroke. When rs2154299 and rs630431
were further incorporated into the risk model including
main effect indicator variables for one and two minor
alleles and corresponding HT intervention interaction
indicator variables, the AUC increased to only 0.651
(0.642, 0.675). A bootstrap test of significance for the
increase in AUC gave a nominal P-value of 0.045.
Discussion
In this report we evaluated the interaction between hor-
mone therapy and 2,763 SNPs on stroke incidence in the
WHI clinical trial, through the use of a two-stage testing
procedure that conducts interaction tests among only the
SNPs passing a first stage filtering based on a marginal
association test with stroke incidence. With gene-environ-
ment interaction being the major focus here, this type of
two-stage procedure allows multiple-testing adjustment to
be restricted to a smaller set of SNPs passing the first
stage screening. This separate adjustment of interaction
testing from main SNP effect testing is justified by the
independence between the two test statistics [29], and pro-
vides a powerful alternative to the procedure of applying
interaction testing to all SNPs. Note, however, that this
testing procedure would not be sensitive for interaction
detection for SNPs for which there is little evidence for a
marginal association with stroke risk.
Our study is novel in being nested within the rando-
mized controlled WHI clinical trial, implying randomiza-
tion assignments that are known and statistically
independent of genotype. This independence allows case-
only interaction tests with their substantial efficiency
gains compared to case-control interaction tests.
Our analyses identified interesting SNPs on two geno-
mic regions: rs2154299 and rs12194855 from the F13A1
region of chromosome 6 with a strong interaction with E
+P; and rs630431 and rs568052 from the PCSK9 region of
chromosome 1 with suggestive evidence for an interaction
with HT. The F13A1 gene encodes subunit A of coagula-
tion factor XIII, which in its active form is involved in the
blood coagulation process. Upon activation by thrombin,
factor XIIIa acts on fibrin to form cross-links between
fibrin molecules to form an insoluble clot. Previous ana-
lyses of the WHI trial data have shown that ischemic
stroke risk is directly associated with baseline D-dimer
levels and that HT increases D-dimer levels [40]. D-dimer
is a fibrin degradation product containing two cross-linked
D fragments of the fibrinogen protein, which is present in
the blood after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis.
Previously, SNPs in the coding region of F13A1 (rs5985
for Val34Leu and rs3024477 for Tyr204Phe) were reported
to be associated with risk of ischemic stroke [4]. However,
neither of these SNPs passed the first stage screening in
our study, and both are in very low linkage disequilibrium
with rs2154299 and rs12194855 (r2
< 0.01).
Variations in the PCSK9 gene have been shown to be
related to the risk of large-vessel atherosclerosis stroke
[41]. PCSK9 encodes the proprotein convertase subtilisin/
kexin type 9 protein, an important regulator of plasma
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. PCSK9 protein binds
to and degrades the low density lipoprotein cholesterol
receptor. PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations result in low
levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and protect
against coronary heart disease while gain-of-function
mutations have the opposite effect [42]. The possibility of
using PCSK9 in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia has
fueled considerable research into related molecular
mechanisms [43]. In the WHI hormone trials, higher levels
of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were related
to the risk of ischemic stroke, and interacted with E-alone
to increase risk [40]. Moreover, in the WHI E-alone trial,
blood PCSK9 protein levels were observed to increase
with E-alone intervention [36]. These findings, together
with the significant interactions discovered in this study
between PCSK9 and both E-alone and E+P, makes PCSK9
another interesting candidate for future study of a rela-
tionship with hormone therapy and stroke risk and
suggests plausible actions through blood low density lipo-
protein cholesterol levels.
In our analysis, interactions of SNPs from the two
regions with hormone therapy led to only a very small
increase in the estimated ability to distinguish stroke
cases from controls. Note that AUCs reported here
represent classification accuracy of the models in the

matched case-control sample and are of exploratory nat-
ure only. On the one hand, matching by factors such as
age and prevalent stroke in the case-control sample
makes the estimated AUC a somewhat distorted, and
likely reduced, estimate of the population AUC; on the
other hand, even the small increase in estimated AUC
when interacting SNPs are added may be optimistic
since these SNPs were identified in the same dataset
used to estimate AUC.
When the simultaneous interaction test with E-alone
and E+P is further separated into its constituents, we
observe highly significant evidence of interaction between
the two F13A1 SNPs with E+P and nominally significant
evidence of interactions between the two PCSK9 SNPs
with E+P and E-alone for total stroke and for ischemic
stroke specifically. The number of hemorrhagic stroke
events is too small for any clear conclusions. The results
suggest that among women with identified SNPs in the
F13A1 region (GG homozygotes for rs2154299 and AA
homozygotes for rs12104885), E-alone or E+P increased
risk of ischemic stroke by about half, with little evidence
of an HT effect on stroke risk if one or more minor SNP
alleles are present. Within the PCSK9 region, among
women with the AA genotype for SNPs rs630431 or
rs568052 the risk of ischemic stroke was approximately
doubled by E-alone; in contrast, risk elevations of a similar
magnitude by E+P were noted among women with the
GG genotype. Considering our procedure of selection
based on most significant interactions, the magnitude of
HR odds ratio variations between genotypes observed in
this project is subject to ‘winner’s curse’ and could be
exaggerated due to the fact that 112 SNPs were considered
in the second stage analyses. These analyses represent an
early step in assessing the role of gene-environment inter-
actions to help explain familial stroke patterns. The ana-
lyses also generate interesting hypotheses concerning
genotype interactions with hormone therapy in relation to
stroke risk that require further confirmatory study.
Conclusions
Two-stage analysis among postmenopausal women gen-
erates novel hypotheses about the interaction between
F13A1 and PCSK9 genomic regions and the effects of
hormonal exposures on postmenopausal stroke risk for
subsequent independent validation. These analyses
represent an early step in assessing the role of genotype
by environment interaction to help explain familial
stroke aggregation.
