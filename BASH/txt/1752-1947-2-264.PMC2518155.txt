Abstract
Introduction: Pancytopenia secondary to hepatitis viral infection is a rare but noted clinical entity.
An acute aplastic crisis usually occurs shortly after viral infection, however, viral serologies are
usually negative and the pancytopenia is often fatal if left untreated.
Case presentation: A 66-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with
shortness of breath and palpitations. She was found to have pulmonary edema secondary to a newly
diagnosed atrial fibrillation and was treated with rate control and anticoagulation. She was found
to have an anemia that was reported to be longstanding and that was apparently being investigated
by a hematologist, although no diagnosis had yet been achieved. Her blood work also revealed a
mild leucopenia and pronounced thrombocytopenia. The patient was admitted to ensure
appropriate rate control of her atrial fibrillation and for work-up of her pancytopenia. Review of
the bone marrow biopsy performed by the hematologist revealed a normal marrow with no
infiltrative process. The results of the patient's blood tests ruled out a hemolytic process. There
was also no evidence of infection, toxin ingestion, or recent medication that could be associated
with pancytopenia. An abdominal ultrasound was ordered to rule out enlargement of the spleen
and a possible consumptive coagulopathy. The spleen was mildly enlarged with a diameter of 13 cm.
The liver, however, was mildly cirrhotic and a small solitary liver lesion was seen. A magnetic
resonance imaging scan of the liver confirmed a single solitary solid mass and the α-fetal protein
level in the serum was elevated. The patient's preliminary viral serologies were positive for hepatitis
C. The patient was diagnosed with presumed hepatocellular carcinoma and referred to a hepatic
surgeon for evaluation of treatment options.
Conclusion: Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia is an acute condition while milder more chronic
presentations, such as this case, likely result from increased portal pressure generated from the
resulting cirrhosis, which leads to a relative hypersplenism.
Introduction
A 66-year-old woman presented to the emergency depart-
ment of the Montreal General Hospital with a 1-week his-
tory of dyspnea and recurrent palpitations. She had
immigrated to Canada from Ethiopia 20 years previously.
At the time of admission, she had been living with her
daughter and was active within the household, participat-
ing in housekeeping activities. She was being treated by

her family doctor for mild hypertension with an angi-
otensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. However, during
the 24-week period prior to admission, she had been fol-
lowed as an outpatient by the hematology department for
moderate but unexplained normocytic anemia (110 g/l;
mean corpuscular volume 89 fl), leucopenia (2.7 × 109/
liter), and thrombocytopenia (68 × 109/liter). Bone mar-
row biopsy had not clarified the etiology of her anemia,
revealing a normocellular marrow with a slight left shift in
the erythroid and myeloid cell lines.
Case presentation
In the emergency department, an electrocardiogram con-
firmed atrial fibrillation and pulmonary edema was evi-
dent on chest X-ray. The patient was admitted to the
medical ward for rate control and diuresis. Heart rate was
controlled with metoprolol. An echocardiogram showed
evidence of left atrial enlargement without evidence of
systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction 60% to 70%).
Although the patient's dyspnea and palpitations had
resolved and she expressed a desire to return home, the
treating team felt that it would be prudent to determine
the etiology of her anemia and thrombocytopenia prior to
discharge. The evolution of the complete blood count
over the course of the admission is summarized in Table
1.
On peripheral smear, there were no blasts, atypical cells or
schizocytes. Review of the bone marrow biopsy confirmed
the previous findings and ruled out any infiltrative or dys-
plastic process in the bone marrow. Iron studies were not
consistent with either iron-deficiency anemia or with ane-
mia of chronic disease (iron 23 μmol/l; total iron binding
capacity 68 μmol/l; ferritin 75.4 μg/l) and reticulocytes
were within normal limits (76 × 109/liter). There was no
evidence for hemolysis (lactic dehydrogenase 162 U/liter,
billirubin total 15.2 μmol/l; billirubin direct 8 μmol/l).
B12 (181 pmol/l) and folate (16.6 nmol/l) levels were
within normal limits. A careful review of the patient's his-
tory did not reveal any systemic causes that might explain
the pancytopenia. The patient denied any recent fever or
infection. She was also persistently afebrile during the
admission. There was no history of recent exposure to tox-
ins or medications associated with marrow failure. A nor-
mal urinalysis and a negative sucrose lysis test ruled out
the possibility of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
There was no evidence of enlargement of the spleen or
chronic stigmata of liver disease on physical examination.
Chart review, however, indicated that an abdominal ultra-
sound performed 4 months previously had shown mild
enlargement of the spleen (splenic diameter of 13 cm) but
also some mild cirrhotic changes. However, liver function
tests were normal, with the exception of a mildly elevated
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (alanine transaminase
33 IU/liter; AST 48 IU/liter; alkaline phosphatase 65 IU/
liter; gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 21 IU/liter), as was
the coagulation profile, international normalized ratio
1.33. Nonetheless, in view of the previous ultrasound
findings and the patient having immigrated from Ethio-
pia, viral hepatitis serologies were ordered and the ultra-
sound repeated.
The repeat ultrasound demonstrated not only the mild cir-
rhotic changes but also a solitary hepatic mass. A magnetic
resonance imaging scan confirmed a solitary solid mass in
region IV of a mildly to moderately cirrhotic liver (Figure
1). Hepatitis serology came back positive for hepatitis C
and the α-fetoprotein level was elevated at 30.1 μg/l.
Based on these findings, a diagnosis of hepatocellular car-
cinoma was made. We believe that the mild pancytopenia
that the patient exhibited was likely attributable to hepa-
titis C infection.
Conclusion
Previously reported cases of acquired pancytopenia asso-
ciated with viral hepatitis have occurred in the context of
acute hepatitis rather than chronic infection, with bone
marrow biopsy usually revealing a markedly hypocellular
marrow [1-3]. Given the normocellular bone marrow
biopsy result in our patient, it is possible that her pancy-
topenia resulted from a combination of the T-cell-medi-
ated immune reaction, that is believed to occur with
hepatitis virus infection [2,3], and peripheral sequestra-
tion from hypersplenism secondary to portal hyperten-
sion induced by the cirrhosis. Although, the patient lacked
any of the stigmata of portal hypertension on physical
examination, the enlargement of the spleen appreciated
on ultrasound is likely attributable to this fact.
The pancytopenia work-up performed in the hospital
undoubtedly prolonged the duration of the patient's hos-
pitalization. Diuresis, rate control and anticoagulation

resolved the symptoms related to atrial fibrillation. How-
ever, in view of the fact that outpatient evaluation had
failed to identify the etiology of her pancytopenia over a
24-week period, it was felt that a more concentrated effort
on an in-patient service would be advisable. We believe
that this led to a more rapid diagnosis of hepatocellular
carcinoma than would have occurred in the outpatient
setting, thus increasing the likelihood of a curative inter-
vention.
